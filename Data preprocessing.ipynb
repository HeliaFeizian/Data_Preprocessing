       "{'influenster.txt': b'Well, eye cream. I felt like it was a waste of money to be very honest. Having never used an eye cream before, except for my eye stick, I felt like I wasn\\'t going to use it, but wasn\\'t I wrong?!I brought this one to my dorm actually, so that I could use it there. Its a cute sample size. But it makes my eyes feel so hydrated!!!This eye cream has a rather strong herbal scent, which might not appeal to everyone. If you\\'ve already tried the Aqua Bomb, you\\'re most likely already familiar with the scent. It\\'s almost the same. I personally stop smelling it once it has absorbed into the skin. I don\\'t mind the scent too much, but I get that others might not like it.The texture is very creamy and lightweight, and it sinks in really quickly. it does leave somem sort of balmy texture behind though, but you only notice it when you touche it with your finger. It makes my skin smooth and hydrated. I am a big fan!\\r\\nThis product is amazing I have the worst under eye circles and this cream has helped moisturize my eye continuously. I love the belief products and I highly recommend using them!\\r\\nMe encant\\xc3\\xb3. Recib\\xc3\\xad este producto en formato tester por mis compras en ULTA y luego de leer rese\\xc3\\xb1as, le di una oportunidad. OMG, incre\\xc3\\xadble. Mi contorno de ojos era s\\xc3\\xbaper seco y con finas l\\xc3\\xadneas, ahora se siente hidratado, suave y el maquillaje luce mucho mejor. Lo recomiendo!!\\r\\nI recently ran out of the Lanc\\xc3\\xb4me genifique eye cream that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been using for the last 3ish months (which I LOVED), so I decided to try this sample I got from Ulta. This Belif eye cream is amazing!!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thick, creamy and super hydrating. A little bit goes a long way, I was able to use this sample packet for 4 days, including the first day where I used enough to moisturize my entire face! \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\xa4\\xa6\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xbc\\xe2\\x80\\x8d\\xe2\\x99\\x80\\xef\\xb8\\x8f It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a scent really at all and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very gentle, so I think it would be fine for all skin types.  This eye cream retails at $48 for 0.84oz so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super affordable (compared to the Lanc\\xc3\\xb4me eye cream, which this is 100% a dupe for). I would absolutely purchase and recommend this to anyone!\\r\\nYesss this is a great eye cream. It is hydrating and the texture is a gel cream. Feels super nice on the eye area. I like to use this as a cooling eye cream, so i store this in the fridge. Works wonders :)\\r\\nAnother sample I got and purchased the full size after. This is my go to eye cream and the full size jar will last you forever! Good price for a great product. It helps with bags and under eye discoloration as well as those fine lines you get with mature skin. Definitely recommend\\r\\nIt\\'s actually pretty nice as far as eye creams go. I find most to be useless but this one really was moisturizing. I dont think id buy the full size though because although it caused me no irritation, the smell I find to be really off putting. Its  got a citrus scent but in a cleaning product kind of way.\\r\\nI received this product for free from Influenster and Belif in exchange of my honest review. I\\'ve been using belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb for more than a week and I already notice a difference on my eyes especially my undereye. It\\'s lightweight and it moisturize my underye. I noticed that it lightens the darkness e too. I like using it in the morning before putting concealer.\\r\\nI received this in my first Allure Beauty Box. I love how unbelievably moisturizing this formula is! It includes ceramides, oat extract, willow bark extract, and squalane (amongst others) which all combine to create a literal moisturizing bomb for my under eyes. My issue with this, and why I have deducted two stars, is that this product has Citrus Autrantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citral, Citronellol, Limonene, and several more ingredients that can be irritating to some people. All of these ingredients are completely unnecessary, and I hope that in the future they make a version that is free of irritating fragrance and oils for those of you out there who can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use (or just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enjoy) fragranced products! I also am a firm believer that an eye cream is just a repackaged and overpriced moisturizer, occasionally with some mica thrown in it to reflect light and make the under eyes look brighter. Find a great moisturizer, and use that under your eyes and it will be just as beneficial.\\r\\nBelif really does know how to do hydration! This moisturizer is super gentle and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see an instant glow!\\r\\nThis eye cream it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really a bomb, you can feel freshness in your eyes immediately after you put this eye cream\\r\\nI really didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it was possible for me to like any Belif brand products until now. All of their gel moisturizers leave a sticky film on my skin and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to absorb. The Moisturizing Eye Balm is different though. It absorbs well into my skin and the gel hydrates my eye area big time, but without leaving a weird film on my skin. This isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t my absolute favorite eye cream of all time, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a good product.\\r\\nThis Korean Skincare Brand is a popular little gem and for good reason. It has soothing tiger grass & oat kernel extract as well as inflammation-fighting comfrey leaf to comfort your tierd and puffy eyes along with darkened spots. The cooling formula is also packed with glycerin and squalane which instantly softens stressed skin. Worked awesome for my poor stressed eyes!\\r\\nThis moisturizing eye bomb is the bomb!! I love that a bit goes a long way. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to use a lot of the product! It smells very citrusy and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s light and gentle to your skin. Very hydrating! belif\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried many different eye creams and this one is my favourite! I love how hydrating if feels and how much more bright it looks under my eyes!! Definitely recommend!!\\r\\nExcellent product. Very kind to skin and shows improvement of under eye impurities. So far I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very satisfied with this product. I use this in conjunction with the belif moisturizer.\\r\\nA lightweight but powerful moisturizing eye cream. Fights premature aging, diminishes existing fine lines, and is cooling. I deducted a star because I feel as though this product is over priced ($48 at Sephora).\\r\\nThis eye cream was nice although it does have more of a thicker texture so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure people with oily skin would like that but it was great for my dry skin so I did enjoy using it but I feel like I could get the same feel and result from something a bit more affordable. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d recommend it if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d want to try it but personally I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t purchase the full size of this.\\r\\nThis is one of my favorite brand and I really like this moisturizing eye bomb. This is perfect for my eyes. It feels like water has kissed my under eyes. This is really perfect \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x99\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x99 I would recommend.\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa6\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa6\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa6\\r\\nThe eye cream is amazing. Currently, It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a top favorite of mine because it really does seem to brighten and de-puff my under eyes. I also enjoyed how the balm left a really nice cooling sensation. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m able to use it 360 degrees around my eye and not have any sensitivity either. It definitely is tightening and brightening. Thanks Influenster for sending this to me to try.\\r\\nI received a sample of this with a Sephora purchase and fell in LOVE. It\\'s hydrating and gentle enough for my sensitive eyes. There wasn\\'t enough product in the sample for me to use it long enough to tell if it made a difference with my dark circles, but I will definitely purchase a full size jar when I get the chance!\\r\\nI received this Voxbox from influenster to sample a couple of burst of hydration creams with glowing skin effects. The belif aqua bomb brightener smells citrusy and the eye bomb both blend well into the skin. The textures are creamy and can be used at any time of the day. I am into products that have a clean smell and that contain vitamins in the products. I recommend these products after showering to avoid an over greasy feeling on the skin. The eye bomb does not have any smell and took a couple of days before I noticed an ease of my laugh lines. \\r\\nI love the coolness and ease which this cream applies. It really does what it claims to do. The scent is really pleasant and i would ABSOLUTELY purchase and truly recommend\\r\\nLoved this product! I received a complimentary sample size, this eye bomb is so moisturizing! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gentle and soothing. It has a cool and cold tingly feeling, which is so nice in the morning it helps wake me up! I love this product and it has became a staple in my skincare routine!\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It is probably one of the best that I have ever tried! I got a small sample size complementary from Influenster however I am so impressed with how little product do you need for each application. You just need the tiniest amount on your finger and it covers your under eyes as well as extra to put on your eyelid. This is really nice because it is an expensive product however I do think if you were to buy it it would last you a really long time. I also really enjoy how this product makes my under eyes feel. It does have that water-based feel which is really nice and it has not clogged my pores which is very important to me however it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also so incredibly hydrating.\\r\\nI liked instant moisture and hydration this cream provided, and kept my eye area hydrated all day. IMO, this eye cream is good for a quick moisturizing fix.  The cream is lightweight, smooth, which makes the application effortless, it has a very mild not artificial scent, I like that there are herbs in the ingredients (comfrey leaf, tiger grass). Also it is free of mineral oils/petrolatum ,but I see it still has alcohol, which is \"a no\" for me. Besides, last time I checked Belief was not cruelty-free,...still?\\r\\nThis stuff makes my eyes feel so refreshed ! I love using it after I clean my face and moisturize. I even like using it when I feel sleepy in the day. Come on cold and smooth almost like an aloe feeling .\\r\\nI received this in my allure beauty box~ I am already a fan of the Belief products. This did not disappoint! It goes on beautifully and makes the under eye feel great. I will be purchasing a regular size. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nIt hydrates very well, easy to spread under your eye. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure if it helps with elasticity. The other one is good too.\\r\\nLove this stuff! Got this as a sample thanks to Sephora. Loved the consistency so much, I started using it as my nightly facial moisturizer. Now I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really notice much in the way of improvement around my eyes (lines or wrinkles, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have many to start with)... But I find the value in its moisturizing abilities. It leaves my skin incredibly supple, I wake up and still feel that my skin is hydrated. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to try their regular face bomb cream before I buy, cuz $48 for full size bottle (.84oz) is a little spendy and I want to see which one is better since this one isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really marketed as a full face cream \\xf0\\x9f\\x99\\x83\\r\\nThe best eye cream I\\'ve ever used. \\xc2\\xa0I use it every night. It keeps my eyes moisturized. I wake up feeling more refreshed and my under eyes are less dry and tired. I have sensitive eyes and It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cause irritation. So happy with this product. Definitely worth it! Highly recommend it!  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nDefinitely recommend well moisturizer keeps your skin hydrated and makes your skin glow \\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nThis is the best eye cream that I have tried at the moment. I have been searching for an eye cream that really moisturizes and refreshes this area for so long without results. But with this one, it really makes the difference.\\r\\nI loved the products. This cream leaves your skin super beautiful, very well hydrated and gives a rich smell, when passing over your face you feel that it relieves you and gives an immediate warning #belifHydrationHeroes #contest #complimentary @belifusa @belifcanada @Influensterbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI recieved this sample in one of my monthly subscription boxes. I\\'ve tried several different eye creams and this one fell short for me. If you just need a moisturizer for your under eye area, this us great. However, I have dark circles and puffiness so I prefer products that have ingredients that correct these issues. Not terrible, just not for me.\\r\\nI love these eye cream my eye lids are very dry but these cream makes my eyes feel and look very moisturized during the day. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m definitely getting the normal size.\\r\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for an eye cream, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re either 1. adding it to your routine, or 2. starting to notice serious lack of hydration during makeup sessions. In allll honesty I thought my eyes were maybe aging pretty bad, but few weeks in and the lines have minimally reduced, my concealer is starting to look at its best again. Moisture is essential to the skin, this is definitely a bomb of hydration. It exceeded my expectation because I thought maybe it was a hyped product, specially with its reasonable price. I was even more impressed at the amount of product in the mini sample, all you need is a dab!\\r\\nEye creams aren\\'t necessary for my routine, but I do enjoy a nice one when they come my way. This is my first time I used a Belif product and I really enjoyed this. The cream is lightweight and glides on skin. There is fragrance in this product and I was a little anxious, but my eyes experienced no redness or irritation from this. For those that are curious about scent, this has a light citrus smell.   I would caution sensitive skin types and those that may have irritated skin to avoid this or wait until your skin repairs itself. I didn\\'t realize I had a small cut on my hand and this cream made my skin red and sensitized only on that spot which is how I found out.  After using this for a few days, I really have come to enjoy this, but it is too pricey for me. If you need an eye cream, I would look elsewhere since the price makes this not worth it. However, if you get it as a gift or free sample I would recommend trying it out since it sinks so nicely in the skin.\\r\\nThis eye cream tightened the skin around my eyes right away after the first time use. It is light and does not have strong odor. It is also made in Korea which definitely adds some points\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x83\\r\\nThis is a nice daytime eye cream. It moisturizes well and has a light, fresh fragrance (eucalyptus, maybe?). It reduces puffiness and tingles a little when I put it on, which is actually kind of nice in the morning! I haven\\'t seen much difference in terms of fine lines and wrinkles, but it\\'s solidly in the rotation! \\xe2\\x9c\\xa8\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8d  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nMy absolute favorite eye cream of all time and I have tried so many!  I love that a little goes a long way and that no matter what the amount is that I apply, every application feels luxurious.  No scent and clean!  Wake up to youthful and supple hydrated eyes.  At 37, this cream is my fountain of youth.  Worth the price!\\r\\nThis eye cream is great for both day and night! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for day because it works well under makeup, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also hydrating enough for night time. I usually use separate eye creams for day and night, but this one is great for travel because I only need to bring this one! I also have really dry undereyes and eyelids that are eczema prone, so a really moisturizing eye cream is a must for me. The only con for me is that it smells too much like fresh ginger (and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really like ginger lol).\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb yes product is amazing I love the way it feels under my eyes. Wish there was a little bit more, Love the smell, The texture feels amazing, I would definitely purchases. \\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nThis eye cream is light and soft. It absorbs into my skin extremely quick and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave a greasy feeling. I love it. Some eye cream would give me pimple but this doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel this product works on me. I use it and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any change on my under eyes bags.\\r\\nThis is a great moisturizer for underneath the eye area. I will say that this is not an anti aging eye cream but highly hydrating for someone like me who suffers from dry skin underneath the eyes. I apply this with my facial moisturizer and let it settle into my skin before applying makeup so this eye gel really helps make my concealer look a little more fresh. I would totally repurchase and use this as my day eye cream for extra hydration.\\r\\nI love how it hydrates the contour of my eyes, its content is very good since it has hyaluronic acid and vitamins c and e, it does not irritate at all and does not burn, they even lowered the tone of the dark circles a bit\\r\\nAwakens & refreshes the skin! This truly is like a drink of water for your face. I have dry skin especially during the summer so I appreciate the hydration this product provides and a little bit goes a long way. It sort of reminds me of tarte Drink of H2O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer. To be honest I will definitely be retiring that and using this instead.   This product gives a healthy, youthful glow And I trying believe it helps improve the appearance of lines & wrinkles. Its lightweight & non-greasy plus it helps soften & plump skin\\'s appearance. It ensures smooth makeup application, no pilling. #hydrationhero #contest #complimentary @belifusa @belifcanada @Influenster\\r\\nI received this first as a sample in an Ipsy bag I believe. I really enjoy this product! It is full of fragrance, so be wary if that is an issue; however, it does smell really good! It has a wonderful texture, somewhere in-between a gel and a cream. It is gentle and leaves your eyes feeling hydrated and soft. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get tight like some eye creams can, especially ones that are meant to help with puffiness or under-eye bags. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t greasy at all either, it soaks in nicely.\\r\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa7Refreshing and cooling  \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa7smooths fine lines \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa7Increases elasticity  \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa7Helps to reduce fine lines \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa7Brightens under eye area \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa7Free from artificial dyes \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa7Suitable for everyone\\r\\nGreat product for eye lid hydration. It says to use on bottom of the eye but I use for both. A minuscule amount is fine, as it glides on smooth.\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb it\\'s part of my night skincare, this is a sample and I have lasted a lot, with little appliance product on both sides, it\\'s light, refreshing, helping to decrease the lines and wrinkles of low eyes, no fragrances or parabenes.\\r\\nI received these products for free from Influenster and belif in exchange for my honest review.  I thought this eye cream was okay... it added moisture, but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see or feel any other benefits. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not worth the price point, in my opinion. I like my eye creams to have additional benefits, like helping with dark circles or reducing puffiness and this didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have anything like that.  I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t purchase this eye cream.\\r\\nThis is one of my all time fave eye creams. It cools and deflates dark circles and puffiness. It really helps to ease the signs of under eye stressors. I personally love it and think you will, too! I would purchase this again.\\r\\nGood, solid eye cream. Smells good, fees good going on, absorbs fast. The gel consistency is good for summer, but probably not thick enough for winter.\\r\\nI have tried many different Belif products and I haven\\'t found one that I didnt love. I\\'ve already gone through a couple small containers of the eye bomb. I\\'m lucky to keep getting samples.  It\\'s very moisturizing yet light at the same time. I really like this product.  It also smells great.\\r\\nI liked this a lot. I love how it hydrates my under eyes and fade away the dark circles. It also has a slight cooling feeling when applying that feels refreshing. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightweight\\r\\nThis really gives u some intense moisture around ur eyes and makes the puffyness from ur eyes go down as well. I only had to use a very small amount to cover my eye and so I know this small little samle will last me for a good amount of time since u dont have to use a lot. It has a small smell to it and I cant put my finger on it kind of a botanical smell with a hint of tee tree.\\r\\nExcelente producto para el contorno de ojos, lo recib\\xc3\\xad en una caja de sephora play y no he pasado de c\\xc3\\xb3mpralo. Funciona bien. Reduce l\\xc3\\xadneas de expresi\\xc3\\xb3n, se siente muy hidratante\\r\\nI liked.  Refreshing, absorbs well, won\\'t build up or flake, can be worn under makeup, and it really works.  I am really obsessed.  I wear it multiple times a day without excessive build-up.  It is so refreshing and charming.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nincredible how every part of our body or skin needs a little care.  With this product under my eyes I keep well hydrated and soft and I even feel that the dark circles of my dark circles diminished.  highly recommended. Complimentary\\r\\nI\\'d give this 4\\xc2\\xbd stars! I got this with my may allure beauty box. I had gotten a deluxe sample of  belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb  which has dye and a heavy perfume fragrance and I couldn\\'t use it so I wasn\\'t sure about this. But this is great. It doesn\\'t have the blue dye and it has a light scent, like Gillette men\\'s original shaving cream. It fades quickly though which I appreciate. This is soothing and didn\\'t irritate the delicate skin around my eyes. It absorbs fully but is still really hydrating and long lasting. I think it might have helped with the redness under my eyes, but I\\'m not sure.  It\\'s a good day eye cream for me for the summer. But the skin around my eyes is so dry this isn\\'t enough for me and I prefer  Kiehl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Avocado Eye Cream . However I really enjoyed trying this and it changed my opinion on belief products. While I wouldn\\'t purchase because it\\'s not quite what I need, if you\\'re someone who wants a long lasting, moisturizing eye cream without the heavy feel this is a good fit. It\\'s $48 for 0.84oz, but unfortunately that\\'s pretty typical of what you have to pay for a good eye cream. It\\'s comparable to the kiehls.\\r\\nComplimentary from influenster, I really love this product because my eyes feel very hydrated and plump.\\r\\nYep! Love this one! Its really creamy texture melts right into my skin leaving a silky smooth finish. I can use this day (underneath makeup) or night. I recommend this eye cream. \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x8b\\r\\nI rarely saw any difference at my skin when i used other moisturizers or serums. But with this one change was noticeable in a few days . My under-eye area is brighter and it softened my wrinkles . I will definitely buy a full-size of this one belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nExcellent product for the eye contour, softens the skin and leaves a pleasant smell \\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\r\\nsmells nice, definitely recommend putting this product on before bed & a little goes a long way. I saw a slight decrease in dark circles which is always nice. no noticeable \\xe2\\x80\\x9cglow\\xe2\\x80\\x9d though, as some might look for in an eye product. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI\\'ve been using this eyecream for a week now, and I\\'ve noticed some changes on my undereye. It lightens and moisturize my undereye, I love it because it\\'s a lightweight and you can\\'t feel it on your eyes it\\'s a little bit sticky but it\\'s fine. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x89 You can notice the changes if you swipe \\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x89\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xbb  it\\'s 11 in the  evening here I tried my best to edit these on still natural color, but I can\\'t adjust the product \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x85  #belifinhydration #contest #complimentary @belifusa @influenster\\r\\nI received this product on my VoxBox campaign, it\\'s been two weeks that I\\'m applying it every night before going to bed and I have to say, I haven\\'t seen a huge improvement in hydration. So, yes, it\\'s not great. Specially for the price. #skincare #eyebomb #voxbox #summer #eyes #springintosummer #springintosummervoxbox\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb This is a very refreshing and light eye cream. The scent is quite different than what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m used to. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the tiger grass that gives more of a eucalyptus scent. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more of a natural origin fragrance. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very soothing and cooling on my skin. I like it for the daytime and the warm weather because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not heavy or greasy but hydrates and soothes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for before my concealer and puffiness.\\r\\nJust finished off a travel size of this. I got a good amount of uses out of it. I used it consecutive days in a row and I can definitely tell a difference of my under eyes. They look brighter and my under-eye lines seem to be less noticeable. I have another eye cream to use next but if I were to need an eye cream during the next Sephora sale I might just pick it up!\\r\\nI got a sample of this in an Ipsy bag and I was lucky enough to to get in a VoxBox for review now, too! The tiniest amount of this goes a long way so don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be discouraged by size/price! I was looking for something that that would help with dark circles under my eyes, but was wowed by the change in the skin texture on my upper lids. Not sure if it helped with my circles (most are from allergies and thin skin/prominent dark veins though), but it completely transformed my upper eyelids. Really plumped and helped with some crepey skin I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even realize was a problem. Noticed a difference in eye makeup application within days. Awesome product!\\r\\nThe belif Moisturizing eye bomb is perfect for those who suffer of a dry eye area and those who want to improve the look and get rid of fine lines. After using this eye cream for about three weeks I feel like im qualified to speak about this product. The belif Moisturizing eye bomb applies beautifully under the eye and absorbs nicely into the skin leaving a great finish, free of residue and ready for makeup application. It is recommended to massage the product around the eye area as usual with the ring fingers and is suggested to pat the product along the contours of the eye which is great! To me the contours of the eye is the orbital bone and not many eye creams are meant to be used in the upper eye area. I have especially been enjoying that because I feel like my eyelids had been looking a bit wrinkly. I found that after using this eye cream the elasticity in my lids has significantly improved. The feeling of the cream on the skin is smooth and cooling giving the eyes the perk that is much needed in the mornings. I am pleased to say that the eye cream does great all day long, it truly keeps the eye looking smooth and hydrated for the day. A problem I have ran into with other eye creams is that they seem to not absorb properly into the skin and cause my concealers to move and crease. This belif Moisturizing eye bomb  does not do that at all, it sits perfectly and works great under my makeup. Although this product delivers moisture to eye immediately to the skin I suggest using it daily for long lasting and continuous results. I rate the belif eye cream a 5 stars out of 5.  I feel that all belif\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claims are true and would recommend this product to you.  I hope that if you were debating on this product my review helped you make your choice. I do want to again disclose that I received this product complementary for testing purposes from belif and Influenster. For more Exquisite Glow content follow my Instaram account @ExquisiteGlow belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis little eye cream is amazing, I didn\\'t pay much attention to the skin around my eyes and that\\'s why I had my skin dry and my make-up didn\\'t fit perfectly. However, as soon as I applied this cream, I had results from the first day. The skin is moisturized, soft and elastic all day long. Most importantly, it is comfortable and easy to put in even a small bag.\\r\\nI have used many eye cream and I really loved this one. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very creamy and I love massaging this under my eye. I can definitely say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very moisturizing and it feels great under the eye. The packaging stay it gives moisture for 26 hours but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really try for 26 hours but I did for 17 hours and it does show a great result. I apply it in the morning before I put on any makeup and I do apply it before going to sleep as well. Also, this one makes your make up stays under the eye really well and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t crease at all. I have received this in my #springintosummer voxbox from influenster and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really refreshing and it works magically.\\r\\nThis product is amazing. I got a sample of this product and now I\\'m thinking to buy a full size. My under eye skin feels so hydrated and smooth. Also I noticed that skin become more elasticity and I love it. Because of reach formula it helps to use a small amount every time and it doesn\\'t leave a grease feeling on my skin.\\r\\nOk, this product is perfect. I used anti-aging eye cream before and never really saw a difference. I gave it a try on the belif eye bomb after reading good review. This product is a must! It work perfecly. I saw a difference in a week. I use it every day, twice a day; morning and night. I really see a difference. My skin is definitly smoother under my eyes. Will buy again for sure as now a part of my skincare routine. #skincaresecret #skincareroutine #eyebomb #eyescream\\r\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x81 This is a really great eye cream.   It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightweight and absorbs quickly and super hydrates my eye area. I like to pair this with my Eye Contour Booster (Baobab + Sarsaparilla) by Odacite to really smooth lines and refresh.   I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a big fan of pot eye cream because I feel like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to pick up too much product and gets exposed to the air.\\r\\nI\\'ll be honest I don\\'t put that much effort into incorporating an eye cream in my skincare routine because I have tried so many and none of them have really wowed me.  I received this product complementary to test out and my first impression upon seeing it was \"oh great another regular eye cream\" then I used it for the first night and I was genuinely blown away. I have tried eye creams from Estee Lauder, Clinique and even La Mer and none of them have been able to hydrate my dehydrated under eyes, none!  I kid you not, this is something that I am going to purchase with my own money when I run out of the sample size.  The formula at first seems thick but when you start blending it out under your eye it becomes so creamy and it gives an instant feeling of hydration.  When it comes to the fragrance of my face products I tend to stay away from anything that has strong smells especially in skincare because my skin is super sensitive and strong smells bother my nose but this eye cream has a subtle, almost like essential oils smell which I do like alot because I use essential oils daily to help with allergies. If you don\\'t like the smell of essential oils, don\\'t panic because the smell is sooo subtle and it does go away after you apply the cream.  I am really impressed by this product because I didn\\'t expect to like it as much as I do, and I didn\\'t think it would be as good as it claims to be. My only regret is that I haven\\'t tried it sooner, and I don\\'t usually feel so strongly about most product so thats saying something. I HIGHLY recommend this eye cream!! RUN TO THE STORE DON\\'T WALK!belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis unscented eye cream doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel as moisturizing to me as the aqua bomb. It does absorb in really fast, though. Maybe I should double it up for better hydration. I have a sample size from a sub box.\\r\\nThis moisturizer has a very very slight medicine smell but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not unpleasant. A little goes a long way also!  My under eye area feels instantly smooth, and supple after applying this ! The container looks small, but there is a lot of product there!!  Worth the money!!  Highly recommend!!\\r\\nI love this eye bomb! My under eye never been this smooth and moisturized as before. After using this for a couple of weeks, my under eye felt well moisturized and the puffiness is gone. I think it will help with fine lines and dark circles too. It has a mild ginger like scent to me. The packaging was nice. I love how lightweight it is and a little product goes a long way. I will definitely recommend this product.   I received this sample product complimentary for testing purposes. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis product brightened up my under eye, I used it every night for about a week and noticed results within a week. We love to see it\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\xbb#belifinhydration #contest #complimentary @belifusa @Influenster\\r\\nI honestly never thought of using eye cream until I received this product. I figured since don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have noticeably dry skin around my eyes that it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t something that I needed in my skincare routine. Well, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just say that after trying this I am glad that did\\xe2\\x80\\x94 you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to have dry skin on your eyes to see the benefits of using a moisturizing eye cream. The texture of this is smooth and easy to apply, and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my eyes (I have very sensitive eyes). I put it on at night and in the morning I notice that those little fine lines are reduced and it also seems to give me a better result when I apply my eye makeup. I would definitely recommend this. #skincare #antiaging #eyecream\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried this product before. I love the consistency of the product it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hydrating and feels amazing on the skin. A little bit of product goes a long way. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if I need to continue using it but I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed any dramatic difference in my under eye area. The product simply just feels good but I would need to continue use to determine how effective it really is.\\r\\nEver since I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had my son my under eyes have decided to fight me\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x85 I honestly haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t used eye cream a lot. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only used 3 other samples: air repair eye cream, answer from eye cream, and akar eye serum... but out of those this one was by far my favorite. It was so much more hydrating than the other two. It was lightweight, but way more moisturizing than the others. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t greasy at all. I do think it helped my dark circles a bit (the others didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do a thing except the serum). I think with consistent use this eye cream would be really good. I might even buy more when I run out\\xf0\\x9f\\xa4\\xb7\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xbc\\xe2\\x80\\x8d\\xe2\\x99\\x80\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8a  I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  #belifinhydration #contest #complimentary @belifusa @influenster #springintosummervoxbox #skincare #skincaretips #eyecream #eyecreams #makeup #skincareroutine #eyeserum #darkcircles #darkcirclestreatment #skinhealth #healthyskin #rings #diamonds   belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI received this product as a free sample in a Voxbox from Influenster, thank you!

The packaging for the #voxbox was so cute !\\r\\nWell I received a deluxe sample of this eye cream as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfree with $35 purchase\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from Sephora Canada and I loved it! This simple eye cream does exactly  what it claims. It provides great hydration to the delicate under eyes area and makes it well- hydrated and plumped. No scents, not heavy! Great moisturizer for under eyes are!\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x99\\r\\nThis eye cream is truly amazing. I didn\\'t think much of trying it out when I received it , but I\\'m so glad I did. It keeps my under eyes so moisturized and hydrated. It\\'s quick to absorb and sits nicely on my skin. I will definitely be purchasing the full size when I run out of the sample size.\\r\\nThis works so well! I personally never used eye cream before because I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I needed it but after using this I could see a difference! My under eyes were well hydrated and looked smoother.\\r\\nA really great eye cream for dry under eyes! I have the mini size and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lasted me since January! The literal definition of a little goes a long way! I really love this one and if I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have others I would repurchase it! Not oily at all and hydrates so well!\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have very dry or sensitive under eyes. Most days I skip under eye concealer because it sometimes looks dry + creases. However, whenever I use this eye cream I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice that as much, which is a huge plus! The formula is very lightweight and super moisturizing and wears well under makeup. It has the *slightest* minty/herbal scent but it fades quickly. The product says it is made for sensitive skin so hopefully that wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate anyone. This claims to give 26 hours of moisture and helps boost elasticity of the skin around the eye. The product retails for $48 for 25 mls. When I first got this product and saw the price I did not think I would repurchase. However, i use the tiniest amount I think this would be a good product to invest in since it would last awhile. This product is made without sulfates, phthalates, mineral oil and is vegan. - Overall, I do enjoy this product and I think it is effective. Unfortunately Belif is not considered cruelty free since they sell in China. Because of that, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give this 5 stars. I would definitely repurchase this product if Belif became 100% cruelty free, I would also like to try other products from them. If that is not a priority to you, I do think this is a great product!\\r\\nWow I love this moisturizer, my under eyes feels soft and glowing, and the bed hydrated, the texture and formula it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best, I used at night and before makeup and wow it works perfectly with my concealer, I can see the difference now\\xe2\\x9c\\xa8,  I received these product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. # belifinhydration #contest #complimentary belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb Influenster\\r\\nThis product it is amazing for who is looking less dark circles and promotes more elasticity around the eye. It is easy to use and self explanatory. There is a nice package. I really recommend this product.belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI love this eye cream belif is really starting to win me over with there aqua bomb skincare line. Every product I have tried thus far is amazing. I started using this eye cream a week ago and it is insanely good. It is such a thick and creamy texture a little surely goes a long way. Also it absorbs into the skin wonderfully and leaves my under-eye feeling hydrated and nourished. This eye cream helps my concealer look flawless and certainly has been helping with my slight eye wrinkles. Though not to noticeable without makeup unfortunately when I apply my concealer it tends to sink into those wrinkles making them look more prominent. But this eye cream has surly been helping with that issue. As far as dark circles are concerned unfortunately that is still a big issue and I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen much change in that category but nonetheless it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make this eye cream any less awesome. I just have to find something to work along with it to help with that specific issue. Overall I am definitely going to be purchasing this eye cream and I recommend anyone who was thinking about giving it a try to give it a go. It is so freaking good.

It really hydrates for hours. I also like that it is perfect packaging for travel since it\\'s not glass. Definitely a new staple in my beauty routine! Compliments of Influenster.\\r\\nI love this product! It\\'s hydrating and refreshing without being sticky or weighty around the eye. I used it mostly overnight and I woke up looking refreshed, especially around my undereyes.   Another staple in my skincare routine. Good for all year use too!\\r\\nI had a deluxe sample size of this eye cream from a Belif gift set and am almost finished with the jar... Overall, I really liked this Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. I would describe it as a lightweight refreshing eye cream, not quite a water gel since the consistency is much thicker, but very refreshing. It has a cooling texture that instantly bursts with hydration and blends seamlessly, keeping the eye area supple and hydrated while prepping it for a smooth crease-free makeup application. I had no issues with this eye cream causing milia or pilling up on my skin. The key ingredients in this product are tiger grass which soothes skin, and comfrey leaf, which is a deeply moisturizing herb that Scottish farmers used historically to hydrate their calloused hands. In my experience, this eye cream is probably best for those with dry skin, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a good overall eye cream for all skin types.   As with all belif products, this Eye Bomb is dermatologically tested and free of mineral oils, petrolatum, and synthetic dyes, fragrances, and animal origin ingredients. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also formulated without parabens, sulfates, and phthalates.\\r\\nSmells amazing! I love the texture \\xe2\\x80\\x94 some eye creams are too thick or very watery. This is the perfect consistency.\\r\\nI\\'m using just a little at a time and that\\'s enough. I have the lower part of my eyes dark and with this product I feel that part more hydrated. I received a sample from Influenster and I am loving it. The eye part is one of the most important parts of the face and we need to take care of it, and this product is helping me.\\r\\nActually, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a wow effect! But I have never try wow effect eye cream! So, I love this cooling texture and how it hydrated my skin! It\\'s clean cosmetics product! No SLS, mineral oils, synthetic preservatives! It\\'s very, very important for me! And I really happy to try belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb almost one week!  @BELIFUSA #BELIFINHYDRATION #complimentary #fairyofmakeup #olasher #olashermua #eyecream #eyebomb\\r\\nThis product is a must have. The belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb leaves your under eyes feeling so refreshed and hydrated without giving them a heavy feeling. This product also has a nice light smell to it which is great. I highly recommend purchasing this eye bomb, it is worth the buy! I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\r\\nI received this complimentary product in my voxbox. I never thought I needed eye cream before I tried this! I never realized my under eyes were so dry and I put this eye moisturizing on and it changed completely. My under eyes looks so shiny and fresh. I totally recommend this product, it does wonders and you need to use very little to do both eyes so it is very economical. I love it!! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb this product is great Influenster send me this product and i love it it mades my eyes very moisturize and great i would recommend to others it also has a good value and definitely good smell i hope y\\xe2\\x80\\x99all enjoyd it too\\r\\nOMG! This is the best eye cream I\\'ve ever tried. It\\'s so lightweight, it feels so good after being applied and it definitely moisturizes the skin around the eyes. I\\'d definitely keep on using it and I\\'d also recommend it to others. It couldn\\'t be better.\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb It is very small in size but very eclectic, moisturizes the skin around the eyes well, makes it soft, the structure is also very gentle, I liked it,i reccomend \\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8c\\r\\nI want to express my love for this product, I bought 2 another after using the first one. I love the smell and texture of it \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8b\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x96\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x96\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x96 Big Big recommendations from me\\xf0\\x9f\\xa5\\xb0\\r\\nI got this as a sample as you can see in the photo. I have been using this sample for almost and month, morning/night, and my dark circles are so much less noticeable. Under my eyes feel not too puffy and very moisturized. The reason I gave this products 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. I would repurchase this if it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t $48 on Sephora :/\\r\\nI am very happy with this cream.  I admit that I often forget to use it.   I use it twice a week and I immediately notice the result.\\r\\nI was not impressed by this product at all, it only took three days for my skin to start hating it. It caused the skin under my eyes to break out in tons of tiny little bumps (I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m suspecting it was the fragrance). However, one thing that I did like about this product is the texture, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very creamy and it felt great upon application.\\r\\nTruly a bomb of moisture! I love dabbing a bit of this on my eyes, and immediately I can feel a difference on my under eye. I like how I only need to apply a little bit so I can\\'t imagine how long this will last me \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x86 gotta love how it\\'s also fragence free because I would not like anything fragence near my eyea, no thank youuuu!\\r\\nA little bit of this product goes a long way! It absorbs well and is super hydrating!\\r\\nI have been loving this eye cream that came in my #voxbox ! It has already improved the look around my eyes where my fine lines were starting to look bigger and bolder than usual.   I love that it provides intense moisture without being greasy and the light scent is nice.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really good! My skin feels smooth, hydrated and fresh after using this cream a few days and it helps me with my dark circles!\\r\\nI get little dry patches on the skin around my eyes, but after a few days of using this I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed them anymore! Also has a nice very subtle scent\\r\\nBelif is really all around one of my favorite brands. Their eye cream just feels like you are putting a cloud under your eyes. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve purchased this eye cream over and over again, never irritates, always silky & smooth as could be. There is not one bad thing to say about it, simply heavenly.\\r\\nI love this eye cream its so silly smooth and hydrating under the eyes every time I use it my under eyes feel so refreshed! I got a mini size of this months back in a subscription box and still have some left because a little goes a long way with this stuff. I will be buying the full size when I run out.highly recommend this product.\\r\\nI just started using this eye bomb \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa3 and I love it! It is super moisturizing and you only need a little bit. I like it because it wakes my eyes up but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not harsh or overpowering. I first received this in my Ipsy bag and now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hooked.\\r\\nI like this eye cream, it keeps my skin hydrated all day long. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help with fine lines, but at least my skin is moisturized!\\r\\n* Sent complimentary thru influencer * I do really like this eye cream. feels very lightweight but hydrating And calming . It does have fragrance that is nice but I prefer without any for my skincare needs.\\r\\nI tried this under one eye for comparison, and I do notice a difference! It does feel more moisturized. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just confused about the long ingredient list, and why willow bark (isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t this a BHA)? In an eye cream? However, It does have moisturizing factors ( ceramide np, squalane, and glycerin for example), which makes sense. Other wise I like it! #belifinhydration #contest #complimentary @belifusa @influenster\\r\\nIt is a very good brand but not the best, the cost is much for what it is actually worth in my opinion, not everything is bad, but honestly it could be better.\\r\\nI was so lucky to get the product in the voxbox!! I tried it and it\\'s AMZING!  definitely will be purchasing this product! amazing!!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m an avid user of eye cream and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried a few brands. By far, this one is one of my favorites. I just feel like it works so well under my eyes. My under eyes feel rejuvenated after applying this and feels very hydrated. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a thicker cream but I feel like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as thick as the etude house eye cream\\xe2\\x80\\x94if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever tried that one!\\r\\nBefore I started using the eye bomb I always switched around my eye creams. I even tried using products from drunk elephant which left my skin feeling super oily plus they were very expensive! The eye bomb is not cheap but worth paying for the product itself. I have noticed that my lines have gone away and my skin is much smoother. I would buy again!\\r\\nOh, my word!  This stuff is amazing!  Thus stuff leaves the skin under and around my eyes really soft and hydrated.  I only have a sample size that I got from IPSY,  but I think when I run out, I\\'m  going to have to buy a full size.  This stuff is super gentle on skin, especially sensitive skin, like mine.  I recommend this product.\\r\\nThis is a good eye cream for the price at night I like to apply a generous amount, during the day since I do like to wear make up I use a light amount so my make up can be applied good if you over apply the eye cream and try to put your make up it will be a mess atleast that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my experience, \\r\\nNice product. I use it all the time, during the day, under my makeup and at night time. Haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really seen drastic changes in the color of my under eye area. But it sure feels more hydrated. Got a trial size as a sample from Sephora. Thinking of getting the full product now. Please share your experience with it:)\\r\\nSo I got the Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb moisturizer sample from my Influenster #SpringintoSummerVoxBox and I have to say this stuff is amazing. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not one to put a different moisturizer under my eyes but I tried this and I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop using it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super light weight, under my eyes is so much more elastic and it works great with makeup! Ngl I definitely want to try their other products because of how smooth and soft it leaves my skin.\\r\\nSO MOISTURIZING. I can actually FEEL how long it lasts. Even after applying makeup. I would definitely purchase belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI suffer from dry under eyes that causes my concealer to crease under my eyes and after applying this before my makeup I no longer have issues with that! This has a gel/cream texture. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not heavy on your skin. It also has no fragrance and dint irritate my skin. Will definitely be looking into buying the full size! I received this #complimentary in my #springintosummer #voxbox.\\r\\nAlthough I got this in my #springintosummervoxbox this is not my first time trying! Strong stuff that makes a difference and de puffs. Do not put anywhere else other than eye area. I learned the hard way. \\xf0\\x9f\\xa4\\xa6\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xbc\\xe2\\x80\\x8d\\xe2\\x99\\x80\\xef\\xb8\\x8f this little tester will last a long time! Good price point. Overall, I like this brand a lot. MUST TRY- aqua bomb! Xo\\r\\nIn my earlier 20\\xe2\\x80\\x99s I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that skin care, let alone under eye care, was important. Let me tell you. Those crows feet and bags showed up QUICK after having my son. I started getting into eye creams and realized that they are important and do help ward off fine lines and wrinkles! This eye cream is a mix of a cream and a gel and makes me eyes feel tight and bright. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so soft on my skin and light weight!\\r\\nPROS - nice, gel-like consistency - smell - refreshing, cool feeling when applied  CONS - price - not effective? i did not see any effects. this was recommended to me by the lady that helped me at sephora, said this was their best-seller so i gave it a try. - packaging\\r\\nI recieved this in one of boxes, I like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s scent, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cery pleasent when applyed and you need little bit amount to moisturize you under eye area. but the important thing is than I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see any difference between before/after. maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because of tiny package\\r\\nGot this with my points from Sephora - haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t used it long enough to see results but like the texture and how smooth it goes on. Will update my review after prolonged use and let you know the results\\r\\nHELLO EVERYONE! So if anyone wants me to do a HONEST review on a product, or you have some question make sure to COMMENT anything you want. And if you want to see more reviews make sure to FOLLOW me. Have a great day! \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8a\\xe2\\xad\\x90\\xef\\xb8\\x8f this is the product of the day:\\r\\nOk this is perfect for someone who has dry under eyes but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much in my opinion. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydrating but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lift the eye or have anti-aging properties. Definitely would recommend to someone with dry under eyes! Tried this product thanks to #springintosummervoxbox\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nI use this product just few days and it\\'s moisturizing my eyes very well! It has a light feeling but it works pretty good. I would recommend this product to everyone. \\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\r\\nI received this eye cream as complimentary for testing purposes. This eye cream smells amazing. It light weight and glides on evenly. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feels like a water based cream than a lotion cream. After applying the eye cream under my  eyes it feels like it help with a little firming by keeping my under eyes hydrated.  Although I did expect it to do a little more but at least it kept it a little hydrated. I used this product before I apply my makeup so it did not crease my concealer. It actually made my makeup look a little smoother which I like. If you want something light weight I  recommend this product. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI got this eye bomb cream from influenster and I loved it. It hydrates your eyes without making it feel greasy and it has a beautiful citrus smell. I know you can get it at sephora but it is a little pricey. It will last you a long time though so I think it\\'s worth the price\\r\\nI loved the texture of this cream. It had no scent with is always great. I ove been putting it on at night and I already see a difference. My dark circles are less visible and that area not as thin. I liked the thickness of this cream.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best moisturizer I have ever used, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice feeling when you put it on under eye, it makes you feel fresh and hydrating.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nLiterally an eye bomb \\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f I love love love this cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a jelly consistency and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re eyes feel immediately hydrated. I use products from other brands but I can always tell a difference when I use this eye cream.\\r\\nThis eye cream is a BOMB haha, literally! I used to have some problems with my under eye, they was very dark, but in the pictures you can see, they are lighter and I love it. I wear this cream every night and is a miracle in a bottle\\xf0\\x9f\\xa6\\x8bbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb #eyecream #undereye #aquabomb #belif #darkcircles #moisturize #skincare\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a true belif-er after using this moisturizing eye bomb. This cream is very hydrating and provides a lot of moisture. It is also not sticky and you get a cooling sensation when you apply it under your eyes. A little dab goes a long way!\\r\\nThis is super hydrating for me eyes! Definitely leaves my under eyes moisturized and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too sticky nor greasy. I have the trial size so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been trying it out for a couple weeks now and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping it lightens up my dark circles!\\r\\nI haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really noticed a difference using this eye cream and I definitely think there are better ones out there. I still give it 3 stars because it hydrates around my eyes and also lessens the dark circles slightly. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t purchase it again unless I had no other options.\\r\\nOMG I GOT THIS FROM@Influenster AS COMPLIMENTARY SUMMER VOXBOX 2 WEEKS AGO AND I STARTED USING IT AND MY EYES NEVER FELT THIS HYDRATED SOFT AND RELAXING IM LITERALLY IN LOVEEE belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nIt\\'s super hydrating and after using it once I can tell that my darkness under my eyes has gone down. My only con is that it\\'s more of a gel consistency and I prefer a cream because it makes me feel more hydrated.\\r\\nThis is one of best moisturisers I have ever tried. This is super hydrating and concentrated. I use this morning and night and anytime in between that the skin around my eyes are dry. It leaves my skin looking some smoother and younger. No line fines any more. And I notice the reduction of the dark circles under my eyes. Great product\\r\\nI received a small sample of this in my Sephora play box and I absolutely loved it. It is extremely hydrating and not greasy at all. I like wearing it both at night and under my make up. \\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nNice eye moisturizer \\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\xb4 has no smell works wonder i don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind this product at all real nice\\r\\nThe super cold weather just began in the Mid-Atlantic, so this eye cream complimentary of Influenster came at the perfect time. It has the best velvety texture and really provides all-day moisture. I have pretty bad under eye bags that are accentuated by dry skin, so this has been really great. The size of the package is really generous as well.\\r\\nThis helps with the puffiness of my eyes I really like this product and will definitely purchase a bigger size.\\r\\nI got this sample on Ipsy, I didn\\'t care about it until I saw some reviews, so I started using it, I could notice that the skin was hydrated with a smooth appearance, I liked the effect, the skin absorbs it very well. As it is a small sample, I use it as an eye moisturizer when I do a special makeup.\\r\\nUnder eye lines are finally gone! This moisturizing eye cream helps to smooth fine lines and boosts skin elasticity! I applied nightly and saw results in just a month! My under eyes look youthful and fresh, no more creasing or terrible lines. I highly recommend this product for all types of skin! The hydrating herbs are gentle on sensitive skin like mine! If you love radiant under eyes add this to your skincare routine!\\r\\nI received this product complimentary from Influenster. I think it is a good eye cream, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very moisturizing. I just wish it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any fragrance or essential oils because they can be irritating, especially under the eyes. I will use the sample I got but I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy it myself. It is also very expensive for an eye cream.\\r\\nI loved this! It was hydrating all day and it honestly improved my bags for me I feel like they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten lighter. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even better underneath makeup! I definitely recommend this! With or without makeup.\\r\\nThis product feels great on the skin. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed a huge difference but it definitely feels cooling under the eyes. It also seems to brighten my skin a bit. Love the packaging of the product as well.\\r\\nThis eye bomb has definitely helped with my under eye bags , dark circles and dry skin on my eye lids. I love the additional cap inside to jar to seal the jar extra tight to keep it at is right consistency and fresh! Definitely worth the money!\\r\\nBrights the eye area a little goes a long way not heavy at all. Gentle on the eyes has a hint of orange scent to it nothing over powering. This was my first time using this product and will definitely be purchasing it.\\r\\nI absolutely love this eye cream. My under eye gets really dry and occasionally a little patchy. I tried so many products to help it, but this is my tried and true. It always helps\\r\\nI got the mini version. This cream is very smooth. It also smells really nice and refreshing. It hydrates instantly but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t last really long for my skin\\r\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x99\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x8e\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x99I got a little sample with my online purchase and I\\'m saving money to buy a full size and eventually more items in the line.\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x99\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x8e\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x99 It hydrates under my eyes perfectly and makes my bags less noticeable. Feels very fresh. Smells like herbs. This product truly makes me feel comfortable in my skin and I\\'m ugly so it\\'s a big deal.\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x99\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x8e\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x99\\r\\nAnother one of those five star products that people were absolutely raving about so I had to try it... So disappointing!! After a few days I started getting tiny white bumps under both eyes!! Instantly stopped using this, Honestly don\\'t know why I still have it around. I\\'ve only had a couple products do this to me and it sucks \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\xad I really wanted a miracle!!\\r\\nOne of the best eye creams I have ever tried in the sense that makes under eye very soft and fresh and helps to feed nutrition to my dark circles. I really love it for day to day wear and would definitely repurchase! #bestof2019\\r\\nThis is my favorite under eye cream ever!! Very impressed with how well it really works & makes my eyes look so youthful!! Creamy & smooth gel like formula really does what it\\'s intended to do it helps me with puffiness & gives my under eyes that added glow!! I received a mini with my Ipsy & I fell in love after my 1st try!! Long lasting & deff a hidden gem in skin care!!! \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x81\\r\\nIf you want an cooling eye affect then this is the product for you!! It really does moisturize the under eye\\r\\nThis product is AMAZING at keeping eyes depuffed and hydrated! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a huge an of the Belif brand and have loved these when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten samples.\\r\\nLove this product. My under eyes are completely moisturized and left feeling hydrated. I notice the fine lines are gone and my makeup goes on super smooth. Highly recommend!\\r\\nI prefer the ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% Egcg than this. I got this sample from my spring to summer voxbox and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really like it. The purfume is too strong and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just irritate my under eyes area.\\r\\nI have used other eye creams but with this one I really felt a difference in about two weeks! The skin in my eyes is softer and you can use it under make up. If you are looking for a good hydration for the eye area, look no further!\\r\\nI started using it yesterday, it came with my VoxBox, I did not feel much the change form one day to the next, but what I did feel and saw, was that normally I wake up with many dark circles and today when I woke up I noticed that they were not very noticeable and I think that if I follow it using will disappear completely, if you suffer from many dark circles like me, I recommend it!belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI received this product for free in an Influenster VoxBox! I am honestly astonished by how moisturizing this is. I put it on before bed and wake up and there is LIFE in my under eyes! My dark circles have always been really bad and they have become noticeably better. And the texture is just amazing- you can feel how moisturizing it is! Love it so much!!!\\r\\nI received this product from Influenster for testing purposes and I really like it. It definitely helps my under eye bags and I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t found a lot of eye creams that help!! It is really expensive and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the only problem I would have for repurchasing it but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great one!! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nWhen i buy somethin for my eyes i am so nervous about how it works. Because skin aroun eyes is so delicate. I love this product. I trust it. It does not causes irritation. Great value for me. For sure, recommended.\\r\\nI love this brand. I love the consistency of the eye cream. I had no complaints. However I recently started noticing it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not absorbing into my skin. If I run my eye the next morning I can feel the product ball up. Disappointing!\\r\\nHaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed a difference in my eyes but I like the cream. A little goes a long wayyyy. I always get the deluxe staples from kits and Sephora. It does have a great feel after being applied and sometimes it runs into my eye that burns like a bitch. But in the products defense it says avoid direct contact with the eyes\\r\\nI really like this product and I love it smells. I feel like I\\'m always looking for something to help hydrate the eye area, under eye and in between the eyes and also always looking for something to kind of help with brightening and smoothing as well.\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\r\\nI absolutely love this stuff! It brings an instant glow and luminous look to the face. After I go to bed and wake up in the morning there is absolutely no lines underneath my eyes. I definitely recommend you try the stuff if you suffer with bags under your eyes! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb has been keeping this tired mama looking fresh and rested on the daily! I apply just a little bit under my eyes after i wash my face in the morning before applying my makeup & its been a lifesaver! #weekendvibes #summerselfie #morningroutine\\r\\nI love this eye cream! It adds so much hydration without making my under eyes feel oily and slick! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the perfect eye cream for right before applying makeup because of how well it absorbs!\\r\\nI loved this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great thick texture that makes in feel like the product is actually being absorbed into the skin and is helping benefit the delicate skin around my eyes. I definitely thought it was moisturizing and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a good price point for what it does.\\r\\nI received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I have been using this product for several days and I have noticeably seen a difference in my skin. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more plump and feels incredibly smooth. Love this product! I deducted one star because of the price because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quite expensive. #GoodbyeJuly\\r\\nGot this product in my first #springintosumervoxbox WHO DOESNT LIKE AN EYE CREAM!  Made my under-eyes feel so hydrated. Gonna continue this one for sure! #belifinhydration belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis moisturizer is very lightweight. My skin is dry and this moisturizer kept my under eyes very normal. The application was smooth and very gentle on the skin. The smell of the product was not harsh, it has a pleasant smell to the moisturizer. #SpringIntoSummerVoxBox #Complimentary #BelifInHydration belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis eye cream is nourishing and so comforting on my eyes. My skin is so sensitive but this cream went above and beyond and soothed my eyes and is LONG LASTING! I would definitely buy this again it\\'s silky and also smells amazing!\\r\\nThis is by far my favorite eye cream! I received a sample of it in a Sephora order and I have been hooked ever since. This reduced puffiness and dark circles immediately. My fine lines seem to be less pronounced as well. Love it.\\r\\nI absolutely love this. It makes my skin so hydrate under my eyes and also calls it when I apply this. It is like an eye cream I have never tried and I would re-purchase this over and over and over and over again that it is expensive for an eye cream and how much it covers with but it is truly amazing.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice eye cream. Texture is lovely and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fresh and cooling on the eyes. It is moisturizing, and me eyes do look a bit more firmer. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this product for about a month and a half now- it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been doing its job and keeps my eyes moisturized although I feel that I have to use a lot of the product to do so. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very thin and almost has a gel-like feel to it. I have oily eyelids and it helps with that because my lids just absorb the product well. Applying eyeliner and mascara after this eye cream is also easy to do! I recommend for the price\\r\\nRecib\\xc3\\xad esta cremita en mi allure box y es disperso hidratante sientes una frescura al aplicarla en el contorno de tus ojos, el empaque no es que me haya agradado mucho ya que siento que no es la manera m\\xc3\\xa1s efectiva de sacar el producto pero funciona s\\xc3\\xbaper bien te hidrata un buen la piel\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI had never heard of this brand before , I received a sample of it and tried it, I am addicted to this. The texture is thick but not heavy and leaves my face feeling so soft and moisturized, my face loves this product !! It doesn\\'t get enough hype,  please give this a try!!!  belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb\\r\\nI love this duo! I use the eye cream and the face cream nightly. The eye cream is so hydrating and a silky smooth feeling. A little goes a long way. I suggest only using it at night though, as it is not a good base for makeup. It needs a few hours to really saturate in your skin, so may cause pilling if applying in the mornings. I also love the face cream for night as well because it is a heavier moisturizer and really hydrates my combo skin. I always wake up with dewy and refreshed skin. Will be repurchasing this combo for sure. These 2 are set to stay in my nighttime routine.\\r\\nI really like using this kept my eyes moisturized all day.works really good in cold weather.\\r\\nI really like belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. It goes on smooth and I feel like it keeps the moisture good under my eyes. No complaints here. I like it so much I bought another one.  That\\'s saying a lot because usually I like to try lots of different products.\\r\\nThis moisturizing eye bomb has become my new favorite daytime addition to my skincare routine. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the last thing I apply before the start of my day. I LOVE how lightweight it feels, how quickly it absorbs, and its refreshing, clean fragrance. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been raving about it so much, that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve even gotten my boyfriend to fall for the trend. I feel like this product really eliminates my dark circles and makes my eyes look more refreshed and hydrated. He agrees. I made the mistake of applying too much the first time I used it.. so a little definitely goes a long way.. which is great given it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s price tag. I gently tap it around and under my eyes and give it a few minutes to absorb. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s usually the last thing I apply during my morning skincare routine. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for either daytime or nighttime use. It contains pennywort herb, also known as gotu kola, which improves circulation, giving you that elastic and smooth look. Comfrey leaf leaves your skin feeling moisturized and glowing. If it weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t for the price, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be buying this product more frequently. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d highly recommend this product if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for a quick and effective eye cream to start off each of your mornings! I received this sample product complimentary for testing purposes. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis eye cream has improved my skin so much! My dark circles have faded and the puffiness is gone. I feel refreshed when I apply it. I apply it 2x a day. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s scent free and smooth, not sticky. Highly recommend! #belifinhydration #contest #complimentary @belifusa @Influenster\\r\\nAt first I was a little hesitant to try it because of my sensitive skin, but once I did, I liked it very much because it helps me reduce the black circles around my eyes, I use it every day and it has helped me a lot \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x99\\xe2\\x9c\\x85\\r\\nGot this in a decent sample size from Ipsy and just finished the container. It goes on as a medium lotion--not thick or light. Overall, I didn\\'t notice any difference, but I love the herbs they mention as their ingredients. However, I don\\'t see myself purchasing this product. It\\'s not listed as \"clean,\" and it\\'s a bit pricey. For that price, I can get a clean, organic product. Because I didn\\'t really see a difference, my search for an organic eye cream continues. I guess I should mention my only eye concern is wrinkles. I\\'m not puffy or dark in that area. \\r\\nI love this eye cream! It doesn\\'t bother my skin and it gives my eyes a glowing during the day! Only requires a small amount so it goes a long way!\\r\\nThis eye cream is very light but incredibly moisturizing. It\\'s fantastic but it didn\\'t work well as a lifting or firming cream for me. Feels very fresh. Smells like herbs. This product truly makes me feel comfortable in my skin.\\r\\nAbsolutely love using this product. My face is very oily so I tend to shy away from moisturizers, however, Belif works wonders for me! I use it every other day roughly and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t over moisturize my skin or make it oily\\r\\nMy eyes feels great after applying it, it feels fresh and smooth with no eye wrinkles when I put on my make up!\\r\\nI like this eye product. It has nice slip and feels good on the skin. It hydrates pretty well. I am not sure it has improved my elasticity but it certainly didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hurt. Sadly, this is not a holy grail product but is a good option while I continue the search!\\r\\nI am SCREAMING over this product! I got a sample of it then 5 days later bought it from Ulta. Kinda pricey ($50) BUT it last forever so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth every penny! The container is so cute and seals so good so the product will never dry out! I will never buy another eye cream other than this again! \\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\r\\nI got this product in the complementary sample size from influenster #SpringIntoSummerVoxBox! It has a refreshing smell and is super light weight. This is my first time using this product and I have really enjoyed it so far. I will buy the full size once I have finished this sample!!\\r\\nReally liked this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s light weight and not too heavy which is perfect for the delicate eye area. Very moisturizing and the smooth texture is almost like a hybrid between a serum and a cream which I really liked. Overall I would recommend this product and think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for a light weight moisturizing eye cream belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb #SpringIntoSummerVoxBox #complimentary\\r\\nProvides lots of moisture and keeps you looking young !! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great consistency and leaves you feeling refreshed\\r\\nI got this as a sample in my last play box and wow do I love it. My eyes get super dry and my makeup application suffers for that reason. This is so super hydrating I never have a problem with my makeup. My eyes look healthier after using it for awhile, the elasticity really is improving! Big plus is it\\'s non comedogenic! But it isn\\'t fungal acne safe.\\r\\nThis eye cream is thick, and works well! My eye area stays hydrated all day! I do not have dark circles, so I am not able to speak on that.\\r\\nNice eye cream by belif this moisturizer eye cream feels good it\\'s just that I had a tiny sample so I think it was gentle on my face\\r\\ngot it in my Ipsy bag so not sure the cost but it smells really good and I like how it feels but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it for over a month and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see a difference. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nthese is BELIF Moisturizing eye bomb , i have 5ml/0.17fl.oz. from ipsy , i think \\xf0\\x9f\\xa4\\x94 do it\\r\\nA comforting moisturizing cream that provides skin with intense hydration, leaving it supple, smooth, and deeply nourished.

I have sensitive skin and don\\'t like strong smelling creams and this is perfect for me. Not overly gelly or tacky, it really just feels hydrating and perfect!\\r\\nLOVED this product. I really did feel that the eyecream dimished the look of my fine line and wrinkles. However not as quick as i would have liked and it would sometimes clump up. But overall i loved it. I would buy this again and i would aslo recommend to friends and have.\\r\\nI have been using this for a couple of weeks. I really enjoy how moisturizing it is. Easily absorbs into the skin and the product lasts a long time. The only thing I dislike about it is I wish it came with some scoop so I wouldn\\'t have to put my fingers in the jar.\\r\\nThis is such a great eye cream! After about a week of usage, I felt it really helped with the bags under my eyes. The product is very thick, but very easy to apply. You can feel how well the moisturizer penetrates when you first apply. Super cute packaging, would recommend!\\r\\nI absolutely love this product. It provides so much moisture. I like using serums underneath it. It also lasts for so long, the coverage is pretty amazing. I also think, while it would be expensive, it works really well on the thin skin on the back of your hands. Overall, this is my holy grail eye moisturizer. Everyone should get it!\\r\\nI got a sample of this eye bomb and I really like it I\\'m considering on buying the whole product. Once you open it it smells really refreshing and when I applied to my eyes and it was really moisturizing . It\\'s really good for any type of skin. \\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nI love this moisturizer, I have very sensitive eye area but thus one is amazing I love the brand, it hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t parabienes, sulfatos and string ingredients that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for me skin, and the delivery 26 hrs hydration that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect for applied before your makeup belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI received an example of this eye cream in my Ipsy Bag.

It\\'s in the name and Belif was not messing around when they made this eye cream !!\\r\\nI got the Belif eye bomb in my play box.  I was so excited to try a new eye moisturizer.  It has a wonderful smell of mint.  The texture is so soft on the skin.  Best part it doesn\\'t sting my eyes.    belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI received these products for free from Influenster and Belif in exchange for my honest review.  What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in your skincare fridge? In mine...

This is wonderful for makeup lovers- your eye will be so hydrated which will help prevent creasing. Absolutely adore this and will be purchasing! \\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\x9f/\\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\x9f  #belifHydrationHeroes #contest #complimentary @belifusa @belifcanada @Influenster\\r\\nI got a sample in Ipsy and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in love. This left my eye skin so soft and supple. When it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done I plan to buy the full size, and I got the moisture bomb moisturizer. These are the best! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI love this. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the mom of Stroke Survivor and I spent many nights having to \\xe2\\x80\\x9csleep\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the hospital\\xef\\xbf\\xbc...This was definitely needed\\r\\nI love this eye contour madly, it really is spectacular, its texture is super soft and silky when it dries, it improves the appearance of my tired eyes a lot, I totally recommend it\\r\\nBelifs moisturizing eye bomb has helped my dry and puffy under eyes so much especially since I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing summer classes. I love the smooth texture and how instantly hydrating it is. It blends seamlessly into the skin and leaves my under eyes feeling hydrated.\\r\\nThis is amazing. I received a tiny one in an Ipsy bag sometime last year and I use it every night now. My eyes water a lot so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m always rubbing the skin under my eye, causing it to stay dry and almost chapped. I put a tiny amount under each eye every night and it just feels sooo good. It really help the dryness! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still using the 0.17 oz sample size, so it lasts forever!\\r\\n\\xc3\\x8d love the cream,  \\xc3\\xad have dark cicle and dry eyes and this This magical eye cream helps boosts elasticity and increases the resilience of your skin for flawless makeup application. \\xc3\\x8d will buy\\r\\nI have dry under eyes and this cream has helped a lot.  I wouldnt say its done anything for fine lines, but if your looking to add moisture this bomb is it.\\r\\nThis cream goes on super smooth, and doesn\\'t feel greasy at all. It feels super hydrating to the touch, and I can feel a noticeable difference when applying eye makeup - it goes on much easier.\\r\\nI was a bit skeptical that this would do anything {I had been trying R&F eye cream with no luck} but I\\'ve been super impressed! \\xc2\\xa0As someone with dark under eye circles, I\\'m amazed at how much this is helping after just 1 week! \\xc2\\xa0I did have a little irritation {itchiness} the first day or two, but nothing since.I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI kindly received this product from @influenster #voxbox @belifusa complimentary for testing purposes and it was perfect timing, with winter just around the corner my skin gets more dry than usual and since my skin is super sensitive I always have a hard time finding a product that works for me and meets my needs.My main area of concern is my under eye area. Since the dryness emphasizes fine lines.  I was super excited to try the Belif Moisturizing eye bomb and I put it to the test by applying it at night time along with my skin care routine and my first impression was that it has a nice consistency creamy but not oily or sticky like other creams I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried, another thing I love is that I could feel immediately how my skin absorb it and it made my skin feel and look hydrated and smooth, its like if I was applying a protective coat to my skin, a little goes a long way. It helps tighten the skin and definitely soften the fine lines under my eyes, its lightweight and it does have a long lasting effect.  This is definitely the best moisturizing eye bomb I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried and my new Obsession, I would definitely recommend it! its magic in a jar!\\r\\nI got this as a sample and I love this for my morning routine. It is beautiful under makewup and so moisturizing in the eyes. No sensitivity or greasy feeling from it\\r\\nI love this eye cream. it honestly moisturizes my eyes real nice. I apply it at night when I go to bed.\\r\\nI received this one from influentes. Must have for your skincare! I love the textura and how my skin feels after it\\r\\nI enjoyed this while it lasted, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice light consistency however hydrating at the same time. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do enough for me as I like anti-aging properties in my eye products.\\r\\nThis is a nice eye cream. I have super dry under eyes and I need something more moisturizing for my eyes. I mainly use this on mornings under my makeup. The makeup goes over this cream really nicely. If you have normal or oily skin you will love this.\\r\\nI am using this right now and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great product. Really hydrating. I apply gently on below eye area and when I wake up in morning I see plumped and hydrated below my eye. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very gentle to skin , I have sensitive skin and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen any reaction. Love it!!!\\r\\nI actually keep a few small jars of this in my fridge. The cold gel feels great under my heavy eyes first thing in the morning or even after a long work day. I cant say there is a huge significant in appearance when using it but I just really enjoy how it feels and how it actually hydrates my undereyes.\\r\\nI fell in LOVE with this eye cream, it\\'s hydrating and feels so lightweight under the eyes. I love this eye cream along with the belif moisturizer. I have combination skin that\\'s sometimes on the sensitive side and these products did not irritate my skin at all.\\r\\nThis is an amazing product. Its very moisturizing. When applied under concealer it does not crease. Absorbs into skin and does not leave a sticky residue. I have tried many other eye products that do not compare to this. It has a cooling feeling when applied in the summer.\\r\\nI love this moisturizing eye bomb. It has become my new favorite daytime addition to my skincare routine. It\\'s the last thing I apply before the start of my day. I LOVE how lightweight it feels, how quickly it absorbs, and its refreshing, clean fragrance. Highly recommended.\\r\\nI absolutely love this eye bomb! It firms my puffy eyes and give me an eye lift. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t improve this at all. I love that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plant based. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very effective although it is a little pricey, but worth every penny! I will be buying it again as Avon sells it now.\\r\\nI was so excited to try this because i LOVE eye creams. I absolutely love the texture and that so little goes so far. My only complaint is that it leaves my eyes feeling a little greasy. Either way I\\'ll love using it up. It definitely has its value, you really only need a tiny dab on your finger to cover your entire eye, both under and top.\\r\\nI got a sample of this through the mail to try.    I\\'d gotten the information from a website I use a lot and sent off for some samples from them. They didn\\'t disappoint!! The eye balm is cooling, and light. I love it!! I use it at night sometimes and wake up to soft under eyes!!!\\r\\nI got the sample product with my moisturizer, and I really like the way it makes under my eyes feel! It definitely has improved elasticity and moisture! I definitely think the normal size of this product will last you a while because just the sample has lasted me a couple months!\\r\\nBelif moisturizing eye bomb  This eye cream is very light, and like a gel texture. Similar to the Belif aqua bomb product line, this eye cream is very hydrating. And a little goes a long way. I just pat a tiny bit under both eyes, it feels and looks moisturizing instantly. It absorbs quickly and I can apply makeup quickly afterward.  It leaves the skin around eyes so smooth and soft. It feels very hydrating and doesn\\'t irritate my eyes. @belif.official @belifusa #belif #skincare #beauty #eyecream #hunniereviews #hunniefavorites #beautybloggers #beautyinfluencer\\r\\ni love this moisturizer, it\\'s hydrating and not too heavy. it doesn\\'t cause my concealer to crease and i use it day and night.\\r\\nI like the smell of this eye cream, I got it from Ipsy beauty bag. it softens skin under eye and relieves skin.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nSmells very nice, has a fantastic texture, absorbs well, etc. The big issue is that it is so heavily perfumed that I just had a horrible allergic reaction to it where one of my eyes swelled most of the way shut. I was fine when on my hand for applying, but the sensitive skin around my eyes has been in horrible pain and inflamed. I\\'ve never had issues with scented products before, but with this being so pungent and going on a very sensitive area, it was a disaster for me. 3/5 because otherwise it would be fine, but the perfume in this product runs a very serious risk for reaction and possible infection. I don\\'t even have sensitive eyes, so those who do, possibly be warned?\\r\\nI received this from Influenster and Belif for testing purposes. Hands down - IN LOVE WITH THIS! This eye bomb worked like a charm! I use this every morning and night, and I have seen a huge difference. I definitely recommend this product to anyone!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThe belief Moisturizing Eye Bomb is probably the best product I have ever had the chance to try on Influenster. I used it every day in the morning and at night and it left the area around my eyes hydrated and refreshed. There was a visible difference in reducing bags and dark circles!\\r\\nWith this cold weather, my skin has been struggling to stay hydrated! I am obsessed with the entire Belif\\xc2\\xa0line. Their eye cream and moisturizer have been a huge win for keeping my skin feeling moisturized, soft, smooth, calm and fresh1 If you are looking for a solution to combat this cold weather, this needs to be your new go to1 I highly recommend it!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI am still using the Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb and haven\\'t noticed much a difference yet. I put it on every night before I go to sleep and I definitely feel the moisture but not sure if I feel as though my skin has tightened around my eyes.\\xc2\\xa0I like the way it feels when applied to my skin and how breathable I feel. Jury is still out if I think it\\'s actually improving the tension of my skin\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about you but using eyeshadow everyday dries my eyelids out so much. So I use this and it makes a huge difference. I use it daily. I definitely recommend to friends\\xf0\\x9f\\x99\\x82\\r\\nLiked this product . Made my skin feel very  soft . Smelled@good as well . I would purchase again\\r\\nI love a good eye product and this one feels great. I carry a small one in my makeup bag and a larger one at home on my counter. A very nice cooling product that has ALOT of moisture. Nice and effective. I\\'ve recommended this to anyone that has asked.\\r\\nThis stuff is amazing. Makes my eyes feel soft and silky. My makeup does not slide or smear when wearing this.\\r\\nI use belief products. Sound the smell is real scented. Very gentle on my skin. Sink right in. My face is so soft. Make some Elemis not as scented. Besides that good value. It does what it says. I would buy again. Plus recommend this product. Try one time\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m unconvinced that eye creams are actually necessary. With that said, I have a couple of small jars of these that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten with Sephora points and I do use them sometimes. It feels nice and soothing when I put it on. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it really does anything for dark circles or fine lines, etc, though.\\r\\nThis eye cream is really hydrating!, I use it overnight and next day my under eye area looked good but I feel it does not reduce the coloration or the bags, is good just for hydration.\\r\\nI used this moisturizer in a cold weather and It helped my eye to be ok. I really like it, i Will buy it again!\\r\\nBelief eye bomb moisturizing cream is absolutely amazing. The smallest amount goes a long way. It works by moisturizing dry, puffy under eye area and by doing this diminishes under eye darkness. It has an amazing texture making sure to not leave the skin greasy; as well as an incredible delicate scent. Please give a round of applause to this great indy product!! Definitely a must by hot item.\\r\\nI really like this eye cream. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it every night for about 6 months now. I had been using the kiehls avocado eye cream and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is nice.  I got a few samples of this that came in sets with Belif moisturizer. I decided to start using them, and was surprised to find out that I actually like this better. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that I would because it does have a lighter texture and I really need a very moisturizing product. I was happy to find out that even though the texture is lighter, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually more moisturizing. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nIm so sad I just finished this eye cream. The moisture it gives was the BOMB! I added this item on my Ipsy subscription account and used it faithfully! I guess I will be purchasing again.\\r\\nRun of the mill. It\\'s a bit too fragranced and a bit too watery for me to truly believe in it is a moisture bomb. I wish it had more vitamins and a creamier consistency.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nAfter someone answered my question regarding this product, I found out about the 100 point sample available at Sephora. Got the item and have been trying it for a week now. As of now, it is hard to say whether it does what it advertises. However, it is very nourishing and absorbs into the skin quite well.\\r\\nWhich skin type is it good for? -Normal -Oily -Combination -Dry - Sensitive   Solutions for:  - Dryness  - Loss of firmness and elasticity  - Fine lines and wrinkles   What it is: A lightweight, refreshing eye cream that smooths fine lines with a 26-hour burst of moisture, boosts elasticity, and increases the resilience of the skin for flawless makeup application. Formulated with hydrating herb, comfrey leaf, and elasticity-boosting pennywort herb, the Moisturizing Eye Bomb provides a flood of intensive moisture for radiant and youthful-looking eyes. This cooling texture instantly bursts with hydration and blends seamlessly, keeping the eye area supple and hydrated while prepping it for a smooth crease-free makeup application.   I got this in small size form the belif set I bought from Sephora and I have been loving this since. I have sensitive eyes and there have been creams I love the result of, but they make my eyes burn or cause milia bumps. This cream is light, but still very hydrating. It absorbs quickly which is great especially for wearing makeup. I noticed a difference in the hydration of my under eyes within 3-4 days of using morning and night.\\r\\nCurrently trying a sample received in a beauty subscription.    Not sure what to expect from a \"clean\" product.  So far, no adverse skin reactions.   The sample received is  great travel size.  The experience so far would make it tempting to buy full size product when finished with the current sample.  Definitely checking other products by this manufacturer.  A little goes a long way!\\r\\nThis is definitely one of my favorite eye creams because it really works. It provides excellent hydration for the entire day which I really love about it. It absorbs really well into the skin and doesn\\'t leave any residue or just sit on the skin. You will definitely get the moisture that you are looking for with this product, plus a little goes a long way.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis stuff is actually pretty good too for the under eye.. nice for application before makeup, leaves the under eye really refreshed an moisturized, kinda a sucker for under eye creams because there arent really many that are that good. This one and the farmacy are definitely my top two.\\r\\nThis is a fantastic product.  I love the light weight, cooling gel.  It is wonderful for hydrating the under eye.  If you have dry under eyes, this is for you.  It is very gentle, no irritation at all.  I recommend you give it a try.\\r\\nThis is such a wonderful product that lasts a long time. It is light and very refreshing to wear\\r\\nGreat hydrating eye cream that will last you forever. I have noticed over the past four months of using this the appearance of my under eyes changing and my under eyes not being as drying when applying makeup. An eye cream is a staple\\r\\nAll the heart eyes for this eye bomb! \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d I have tried many eye creams and this bomb just really does exceed my expectations. So moisturizing and feels so good on the skin. This is a must try!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nOMG I absolutely love this product. I use it every night after cleansing with my derma e cleansing oil and after I spray my Mario rose spray. This works for me as I have allergies and sensitive skin. If you need an extra boost of moisture under your eyes this is the product for you. I\\'m in my 40s and people always say I look like I\\'m in my 30s. I think it\\'s due to good skincare and keeping your eyes hydrated. I recommend this product.\\r\\nThought his eye cream would be great for my dry and sensitive skin but it made my skin sting a little after putting on, which I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind too much. Within a week the skin around my eyes was super dry, itchy and scary looking, I stopped using it and went back to my regular eye cream and my skin went back to normal. I gave it one more try and the dryness came back!! Unfortunately, this product just didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work for me. A big NO!\\r\\nFantastic eye cream! Truly feel hydrated all day. Great prep before concealer.  Never look dry. Sometimes I mix a little with concealer for a more natural look.\\r\\nI got a sample of this in Ipsy and was excited to try it after hearing people rave about it for years, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand the hype. This is basically just a moisturizer you can use in the eye area. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t depuff, brighten, or plump the eye area at all. It simply hydrates and is a nice base for under eye concealer, but using my moisturizer in my eye area does the exact same thing. This uses a lot of silicones so it will reduce the appearance of fine lines/creasing until you wash it off, but it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t treating or reducing them at all and isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t anti-aging. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t knock this product too much because it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really claim to do any of these things, I just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand why so many people would spend $50 on a product when most moisturizers can do the same thing. I will give it a little credit though for being gentle on my sensitive eyes.\\r\\nI was so lucky to receive this product in my Belif Voxbox from Influenster. I absolutely love their True Cream Aqua Bomb. It has become my number one moisturizer and nothing else can compare to it.  The formula of this Moisture Bomb eye cream is so soothing and cooling on the eyes. It absorbs instantly and leaves the skin around my eyes super hydrated. I actually never realized that I had a couple dry patches on my eyelids, making it difficult to blend out shadows in certain areas. This product has completely eliminated that dry flaky skin on my lids. I am so happy I was able to try this product and will definitely be repurchasing. I get a lot of eye creams to try and often do not end up repurchasing because they all seem to do the same thing. Not true with this product.\\r\\nI received this product to test out through Influenster and I am HOOKED! I seriously have never felt such a luxurious, hydrating cream. I wish I could cover my whole body in this stuff! I will certainly be buying this in the future as it has become a staple in my beauty routine!\\r\\nI would say this eye cream is definitely moisturizing not exactly sure 26 hrs worth. It is the right consistency and easy to apply. It does moisturize under the eye but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice a difference with fine lines/ wrinkles or dark circles. Also, it is fragranced with a floral scent which I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too fond of.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only had a chance to try a mini (5ml); but I was quickly sold! I loved the lightweight texture, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very refreshing. I also don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind the packaging but prefer a pump. Even so, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d consider repurchasing this once I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve finished what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m currently using.\\r\\nThe price is pretty good, the product is pretty good and it last a very long time. I think this kind of eye cream is better in the summer when the skin doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need as much moisturizing. I have dry patches on my lid right now and this eye cream has done nothing to help. I would use it as a lighter moisturizer for the warmer months when my skin is more oily and prefers a gel cream.\\r\\nI LOVE this mask. Perfect nighttime moisture, without clogging my pores with a cream . Great gel formula, and the jelly is really fun to be fair. No scent, and perfect for sensitive, oily skin. Love it!!\\r\\nWhat can I say?!?! Except this is an absolutely amazing product and I highly recommend it! LOVE the way it feels! Will buy again and again and again! Lol\\r\\nThis is my go to eye cream. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it for anti aging but It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydrating. Only downside is that it pills a little under makeup\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been applying this everyday for a week or more now and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed I have less wrinkling in my inner corner. I like to use this with retinol after I have washed my face . Belief is a good brand , check it out sometime\\r\\nThis is one of those products that I WISH I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t love because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pricey. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s roughly $60 CAD, which is a lot for an eye cream, especially one that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have retinol. That being said, this eye cream has been a god send this cold Alberta winter. It is so thick and hydrating, and has great soothing and detoxifying ingredients. I have had zero issues with dryness around my eyes, and I even use a little around my nostrils to keep the dry patches away. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a fan of the aqua bomb, be aware that this is not the same consistency or texture, it is a much thicker cream. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed any crazy bags around my eyes while using this, and I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because the area is so plump and hydrated.\\r\\nIt\\'s nice and moisturizing, but kind of expensive for what it is. Drugstore eye creams do just as well, in my opinion, although I did like that it is a thick gel rather than a cream. It irritates my eyes a little bit, and felt kind of \"goopy\" (but most eye moisturizers do, anyway). I didn\\'t see much improvement in dark under-eyes or fine lines, not really any brightening, although I can\\'t remember if it made any of those claims antway. It does moisturize nicely. I used it up, but I won\\'t buy more of it.\\r\\nI received this in a sample size with my moisturizer purchase.  Its a nice lightweight eye cream. It tingles a little bit i assume thats for de-puffing? Anyway I like it. I would purchase a full size.\\r\\n\\xf0\\x9d\\x90\\x88\\xf0\\x9d\\x90\\x86 \\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\xb8 1\\xf0\\x9d\\x92\\x90\\xf0\\x9d\\x92\\x97\\xf0\\x9d\\x92\\x86\\xf0\\x9d\\x92\\x82\\xf0\\x9d\\x92\\x8e\\xf0\\x9d\\x92\\x83\\xf0\\x9d\\x92\\x86\\xf0\\x9d\\x92\\x93  \\xf0\\x9f\\xa4\\x8d  \\xf0\\x9f\\x84\\xb1\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x81\\xf0\\x9f\\x84\\xb0\\xf0\\x9f\\x84\\xbd\\xf0\\x9f\\x84\\xb3: @belifusa \\xf0\\x9f\\x84\\xbf\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x81\\xf0\\x9f\\x84\\xbe\\xf0\\x9f\\x84\\xb3\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x84\\xf0\\x9f\\x84\\xb2\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x83: Moisturizing Eye Bomb  \\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x81\\xf0\\x9f\\x84\\xb0\\xf0\\x9f\\x85\\x83\\xf0\\x9f\\x84\\xb8\\xf0\\x9f\\x84\\xbd\\xf0\\x9f\\x84\\xb6: \\xe2\\xad\\x90\\xe2\\xad\\x90\\xe2\\xad\\x90\\xe2\\xad\\x90 This eye bomb is heavenly \\xf0\\x9f\\x8c\\xa5\\xef\\xb8\\x8f cool on contact, it absorbs nicely.

It makes my eye lines less noticeable.  The only thing that could make this product better is if it came into a different packaging instead of a jar.\\r\\nThis eye cream feels very hydrating, like your eyes just had a glass of water. The cream feels very light weight. The scent is very mild and leaves a fresh cool feeling underneath my eyes. Works great as a moisturizer for your eyes. I use it every morning.\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb I have been using this for a few days now. It seems to be a good product. I put it on at bedtime, it goes on very easy n it\\'s not oily or greasy feeling. I do like to try all different eye cream and gels. I do have to say I don\\'t mind this eye gel at all. I will keep using it every night in my nighttime routine.\\r\\nI am biased because I truly believe Belif is great for a daily skin care routine! Light and not sticky \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x89 #Productobsessedmom #belifusa\\r\\nLoveeeddd ittt.. i got this is as a gift from sephora and im using it it hydrates very well under eye area and helps to blend the concealer and lastsa for hours and hoursss im looking for purchasing the full size i really recommend it for those who suffer from dry undereye zone its a very good product based on water and healthy belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI. LOVE. THIS. I suffer from extremely dry eyelids and under eyes and this has completely solved that issue for me. This helped the flakiness and redness that other moisturizers couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fix. It feels really gentle but gets the job done.\\r\\nThis. product. is. great. I have terrible eye bags from waking up so early and this product plumps and rejuvenates me!\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8a Heck yeah! I recommend!\\r\\nI was gifted this by influenster but this is an honest review. So silky and smooth, kept eyes moisturized and young ! #springvoxbox\\r\\nThe belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is a really nice eye cream! I alternate it with the belif First Aid 360 Eye Care Mask as a daytime eye cream. The Eye Bomb has a light texture which makes it great for pretty much any skin type (including sensitive). The scent is pleasant but light, which is typical for Belif products. This eye cream is primarily for hydration but if your skin is really dry then the belif Peat Miracle Revital Eye Cream may be a better option for you.\\r\\nLOVE this product, use it every night in my skincare routine before bed. I tend to get fine wrinkles under my eyes if my skin gets dry... nothing else moisturizes my under eyes as well! It feels so light and smooth, and works. I was devastated when they were out of stock, as soon as I got word they were back I immediately purchased more!\\r\\nGreat brand. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used this line for a couple years, especially the face moisturizer. A little expensive but all the good brands are. It did help with the dry skin I get under my eyes sometimes, and helped my eyes look less tired and helped with some of my dark circles. I honestly just stopped using it because I change products every once an awhile, and found a product that I like just a tiny bit more. But I do recommend.\\r\\nThis is amazing! A wonderful way to set your eyes for the night. It\\'s great to help keep them from ever getting dry and I will truly be sad when mine is gone. It\\'s very effective and does all it promises. If your using a retinol, this is great to follow up with.\\r\\nThis eye bomb is crazy good! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not easily impressed with skincare because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried a lot of products but this one I like a lot. This is a sample from Sephora that I tried recently. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great that they give you a decent sample because you can really see if it works. This is a very whipped but dense cream. It has substance. It smells very citrusy to me (think lemons and oranges). I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind the scent but if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sensitive to fragrance, this might bother you. You only need a tiny dab of this for each eye. A little goes a long way! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very moisturizing and makes the skin around your eyes feel more supple. #skincaresecret #belif #eyecream #fashionista #mymakeupbag #beautyoverhaul #gamechanger\\r\\nLovely eye cream that actually feels like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moisturizing my eye area. I have dry skin and I love this in winter especially!\\r\\nIt\\'s a great product, it feels fresh & once it goes on your skin it feels like water just a bith thicker.i dont feel like its sticky like some I have triesd in the past. You only need a tiny amount. I am using this every day  for almost  a month now. I received it in my ipsy bag & decided to give it a try. I have dark under eyes & this has helped me tremendously. I do use  this with another eye serum but there has been days when I use this alone before I do my makeup & I have noticed  it makes the concealer look smooth. I do love this product a lot & will be repurchasing once I run out. I will recommend this to others.\\r\\nGot a sample of this in the mail. This eye product is way more thicker & cream-like than the moisturizer & cleanser Belif makes. I never used an eye cream that is this thick before. It was ok. It has the same scent as the cleanser & face cream but alot lighter almost to the point you can\\'t smell that it even has a scent. When I finally run out of all my other skin cleansers & creams I may get this skincare collection.\\r\\n#inlovewithbelif I\\'ve been using it for three days now and I already like this product! Im thinking of buying a full size one \\xf0\\x9f\\x99\\x8c it really helps make my tired eyes look better \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x9a\\r\\nLightweight, hydrating and softened my fine lines and wrinkles under my eye. Really like this brand and how their products perform.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the most amazing moisturizer i have ever used, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice feeling when you put it on under eye, it makes you feel fresh for 26 hrs! Love this moisturizer, this prodect is really one of the must have products! I recommend it\\r\\nSo far I am loving this eye cream! It has such a creamy texture that absorbs quickly and doesn\\'t leave any residue behind. It helps to hydrate and plump the skin around my eyes leaving them looking younger. I received the travel size in my Ipsy glam bag as one of my add-ons and I\\'m so glad I did!\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb  *Sample size featured* I really enjoy this product. It\\'s great for when I\\'ve been outside all day and my my skin needs that extra boost. After washing my face I put it under my eyes and it instantly gives them life again. You can definitely feel the moisture. I absolutely recommend this product!\\r\\nUgh I wanted to love this because it was so highly recommended at Sephora. However, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more of a gel like consistency and I prefer a heavy creamy consistency more. I believe it was about $40 for the pot. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never had any issues with it, but I also haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen any differences that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s made. A little disappointed!\\r\\nI wish i could rate this 100! This is one of my holy grails! I use it everyday! I really really love this along with my face moisturizers from Belif, they make my skin feel so so so soft and good after wearing makeup all day\\r\\nI got a small sample and am willing to buy the full size of this amazing product it hydrate under my eyes just the way how i want it its  not that oily or thick smells like herbs and feels soft ... i love it and yes ill purchase the full size ! And am about to fikish it too \\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8a\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8d\\r\\nI love this one! I got this in my ipsy bag and even though it was a small sample it lasts long! The eye cream is very smooth, watery and refreshing. It absorbs into the skin quite well and my under eye area was feeling so fresh and clean. I will definitely purchase a full size one.\\r\\nThis under eye cream is simply amazing! It leaves my skin feeling super moisturized and hydrated. It also helped me with small wrinkles around my eyes. By far the best cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever tried. Totally recommend!\\r\\nSo I am a ride or die supporter of the brand \"Belif\". With my oily, acne prone, problematic, sensitive skin, their aqua bomb moisturizer is my absolute holy Grail, and I refuse to use anything else. Any product I\\'ve ever tried by this brand, I absolutely love. This moisturizing eye bomb doesn\\'t dissapoint neither. I use my aqua bomb moisturizer, followed along with this guy right here, the moisturizing eye bomb. I recently got the aqua bomb sleeping mask, so I\\'m in pretty good shape at the moment lol. To be honest, Me having the full size of this eye bomb, and have honestly been using for about 2 months now, I can say my honest opinion on this, and that is.. This is one of the best eye creams I have ever owned and used on my oily, acne prone face. Some say this eye bomb does nothing for fine lines, but I beg to differ. I\\'m 28, been a smoker for over half my life, and try to take extremely good care of my skin (even though I know smoking is terrible) and I plan to quit one day, but until then, I will continue to use \"preventive\" skin care for my aging face, so I can age gracefully. Now, I wouldn\\'t say I have extreme fine lines or anything (like I said, I take good care of my face, expecially being a smoker) but I do have little baby fine lines under my eyes, and this eye bomb DOES plump them up, and helps diminish the appearance of them. I can apply my eye bomb to one eye, and not the other, and you can truly tell a difference. This is not just a hydrating eye cream. This eye cream DOES help with fine lines, and DOES help with brightening up the under eye, and making makeup application a cinch. People don\\'t give this bad boy enough credit if you ask me. I love this product. Since I own the full size, I will vouge and say that this product is worth the price, due to how long it has lasted me. All you need is a dab under each eye, which means this will last a very good while. People keep saying this jar is small, and I also beg to differ on that too. Most eye creams are alot smaller than what the full size eye bomb comes in. Belif has wonderful products, and I will continue to love, use, and support this brand. Don\\'t let these negative reviews change your mind..This eye bomb is the ish. Smells amazing. Soaks right into your skin. Concealer melts into your skin on top of it, and fine lines ARE plumped up, and diminish a bit over time. I\\'m walking proof it does. If your oily, acne prone like me, try this eye bomb out. Get you a sample from Sephora. You will run to the store and buy the full size as soon as you realize how good this baby really is. Pair it with other Belif products for the best results too. I highly recommend!!\\r\\nI really enjoyed this under eye moisturizer u just didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe this transformed my under eyes. Good product not great. Very gentle and soothing.\\r\\nI purchased this cream because I am in love with their moisturizing bomb (saved my skin). I have been noticing fine lines due to dryness under my eyes, and my makeup has not been sitting as well under the eye. I\\'ve been using this for about a month now and I can say that the fine lines have gone away (I\\'m only 22 so I knew they were accentuated because of the dry skin). My makeup has been sitting much better and has not been flaking up or showing texture under the eye. This is my savior this winter.\\xc2\\xa0The only thing I would change about this is the packaging. The small jar is kind of inconvenient if you have even slightly long nails and I hate getting product under my nails. But, because of how much this helps I will disregard that.\\xc2\\xa0This is a pricey eye cream but it is no joke. Belif\\'s products live up to their claims, and i\\'d feel comfortable recommending this to anyone with dry skin and sensitive under-eyes.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI bought this because of the rave reviews and because it was new on Sephora and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a sucker for eye creams. I think you get a good value considering you get 10 ml more than a typical eye cream. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d recommend!\\r\\nI\\'ve been using this twice a day for about 3 weeks or so and I\\'ve definitely notice that the little fine lines next to my eyes are diminished. I think the biggest factor in that is that the Moisturizing eye bomb is the perfect combination of moisturizing (of course) with a nice texture and enough substance to stick around all day or night.\\xc2\\xa0I love the packaging and the size is very generous. I\\'m used to eye creams in little jars, but this one is a much more generous size and I\\'ve barely made a dent in it.\\xc2\\xa0It is a gel cream texture, not oily, and it absorbs well, but also protects the eye area so your skin doesn\\'t just suck it up and leave the area dry again. It really does last for at least 10 hours or so I\\'d say, probably longer if you\\'re not in the dry, cold atmosphere I\\'m dealing with right now.\\xc2\\xa0I received this product free to test and review from Influenster. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb \\r\\nAmazing!!! I have been looking for a great under eye moisturizer and I really like the belief line but this is by far my favorite product they have came out with so far! Go get you a sample tomorrow\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ok - it hydrated my eye area but it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything else like brighten which is what I really needed. I am giving it 4 stars because maybe you need something hydrating, which I guess is what it advertised.\\r\\nI loved this eye cream. I have super sensitive eyes and everything makes them burn but this did not! Was so soothing and moisturizing and plumped up my eyes immediately. Will repurchase and this is worth the splurge.\\r\\nThis is very hydrating and smooth on my under eye area. It also gives a nice cooling sensation. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need much to get hydration, and in the winter I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use this and the aqua bomb together. I would buy this again.\\r\\nI absolutely love love love this eye cream. When I would do makeup application I would always grab for this eye cream. It helped to smooth lines under the eye and wrinkles and make everything look seamless. I would suggest this to everyone! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI got a sample of this and I have to say my skin under my eyes was so smooth and moisturized it felt great! Within weeks of use my crows feet were way less pronounced and my dry skin was very moisturized. I feel that if we keep our skin moisturized we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get as many wrinkles. I love this product and I definitely recommend. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nA great little eye moisturizer without a great big price. Along with the other Belief products, this eye cream is top notch. Helps diminish fine lines and moistures around the eye area. Perfect little addition to a morning routine\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a huge fan of eye creams because they tend to make my under eyes feel greasy. This eye cream is a total game changer! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydrating and moisturizing without feeling greasy and it layers beautifully under makeup. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so glad I found this!\\r\\nWay too overpriced for the amount of the product. It smells good and hydrates and moisturizes. The packaging and the colors are okay pretty. I honestly believe you can find better eye creams than this. Caffeine induced products do better. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t purchase again unless I had extra money.\\r\\nThis product is fantastic! I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking into it. You get a lot for what you pay and i was happy with it. It was for sure a good buy and something i would buy again. Great product!\\r\\nDefinitely recommend over the tatcha water cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s practically the same for a fraction of the price. Super hydrating and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel heavy on the skin. Tatcha The Water Cream belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really notice much of a difference when using this product. I used it until it was empty though. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very basic eye cream, and it reminds me of Neutrogena\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydro boost moisturizer.\\r\\nI was very impressed with this eye cream, and the packaging is very cute. I will definitely be buying more from this brand! Kept my eye area very moisturized for the entire day without having to reapply.\\r\\nThe texture of this product is watery but creamy...almost gel-like. It feels super nice on the skin and I found it super hydrating! The only problem was that I got some little red bumps on my face the next day. My skin is pretty dang sensitive so lots of things break me out. For someone who doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have sensitive skin I would recommend!\\r\\nI LOVED this product. I often get dry skin around my eyes due to where I live and this product eliminated it right away. It\\'s super moisturizing but not so heavy that it doesn\\'t feel like it absorbs into your face. I tried it as a sample but I will be buying a full size once I\\'m done.\\r\\nAMAZING, instantly hydrates. Lightweight, very light scent but smells good! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely worth the price!!\\r\\nLove this even though it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pricey it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an investment in your skin care and your eyes are honestly such a big key\\r\\nAs I have said before, I am intense in taking care of my skin, more than my entire face. My routine is strict and I never miss a day. This product is very good, the company creates spectacular products. I really like it, I highly recommend it as it works for all skin types. It does not leave unfavorable reactions, and with a constant routine you will see the results.\\r\\nI got this product in an Ipsy bag. And while I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try the full size, the trial size lasted me a month. A little goes a long way. And this really does moisturize my under eyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for the winter months.\\r\\nI haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t used the product yet to give a review. So I will update once I have tried and make sure I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sensitive to it!\\r\\nHello BEAUTIFUL, how you doin?? Haha!  I love this product! Super gentle on my eyes. I apply this morning and night. Doesnt get rid of under eye bags but makes them super hydrated. It\\'s a nice drink for your eyes and makes them feel much better. Will repurchase!!!  P.S. it lasts foreverrrrr! I\\'ve had samples of this last me months! You only need a teeny tiny bit!\\r\\nI have very sensitive and dry skin and this eye cream hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t caused any reactions. The smell is subtle and the texture is quite creamy, a little definitely goes a long way. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a decent amount of product, though the size of the container can be a little misleading since there is a lot of plastic that kind of gives the illusion that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more, if that makes sense?belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nGreat moisturizing product, great for colder and drier temps! I like this for nighttime since it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydrating\\r\\nI received multiple samples of this product from Sephora and plan to purchase the full size. The skin around my eyes tends to be very dry but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tolerate heavy serums or moisturizers well. This product has been perfect - hydrates and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cause any irritate around the eyes.\\r\\nSo amazing! Larger in size than most eye creams on the market! Super hydrating gel formula dries quickly and provides all day hydration! Gentle & effective \\xe2\\xad\\x90\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\r\\nEye creams are tricky. I got samples when this launched at genbeauty (now ipsy live) and its really nice. No added fragrance and not to heavy or too light. A teeny tap in the jar will do. Definitely see less lines. This brand is very neutral suitable for all skin types. I like to use at night to keep hydration as I sleep\\r\\nOf the moisturizers for the eye contour this is my favorite, I confess that I had never used until I got this in my ipsy and I LOVE IT\\r\\nTHIS EYE CREAM IS VERY HYDRATING. I LOVE TO USE IT FOR BOTH MY DAY AND NIGHT SKIN CARE ROUTINE. IT\\'S NOT TOO HEAVY UNDER MAKEUP\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x99\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa1Me encanta esta crema para los ojos!  Probablemente el mejor que he probado hasta ahora.  Mi vieja crema para ojos era una marca decente que tambi\\xc3\\xa9n vende Sephora, pero no se compara con esta.  Con otras cremas para los ojos, mi \\xc3\\xa1rea debajo de los ojos todav\\xc3\\xada estaba un poco seca solo una hora despu\\xc3\\xa9s de la aplicaci\\xc3\\xb3n, y esta realmente se hidrata.  Se siente relajante y como una hidrataci\\xc3\\xb3n refrescante para el \\xc3\\xa1rea debajo de los ojos: la hidrataci\\xc3\\xb3n dura todo el d\\xc3\\xada, y estoy feliz de haber comprado esto.  Solo lo he estado usando durante unos d\\xc3\\xadas y he notado una mejora en mis c\\xc3\\xadrculos s\\xc3\\xbaper oscuros debajo de los ojos.  Sin embargo, no estoy seguro de lo bueno que es prevenir las arrugas / l\\xc3\\xadneas finas para el \\xc3\\xa1rea debajo de los ojos, lo cual es una preocupaci\\xc3\\xb3n m\\xc3\\xada, por lo que podr\\xc3\\xada colocar un suero ocular antienvejecimiento debajo de esto.  Pero en general, estoy muy contento con mi compra, y esto tambi\\xc3\\xa9n es genial para personas como yo que sufren de alergias terribles.  Me froto los ojos constantemente y soy muy al\\xc3\\xa9rgico a muchos tipos de hierba.  No irrita mis ojos y no arde mucho si me froto los ojos despu\\xc3\\xa9s de aplicar esto.  S\\xc3\\xbaper contento de haber descubierto esto, pero eventualmente lo pondr\\xc3\\xa9 con algo m\\xc3\\xa1s debajo para obtener beneficios m\\xc3\\xa1s fuertes contra el envejecimiento bajo los ojos.\\r\\nI love this eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so gentle yet effective! It smells amazing and creates a brightening effect under my eyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great cream!\\r\\nBelif Eye Moisturizing Pump, is full of tiger grass, naturally helping to calm swollen areas under the eyes. supporting a hydration for 26 hours. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d I received my Belif moisturizing eye bonba in my box from @influenster and I am delighted with this product. They have a pleasant aroma, their texture is light but above all it provides good hydration. Belif is wonderful! \\xf0\\x9f\\xa4\\xa9\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x99\\r\\nAmazing este cream!! Definetly change my under eye area That used to be very dry. Since I start using it before my makeup it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s looking better and better\\r\\nFirst time trying this eye cream, and let me tell you that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard for me to come by eye creams that I love! This is definitely one of them, considering that almost every eye cream gives me some kind of bad reaction. This is one of the two eye creams that I swear by, it provides great moisture and significantly reduces the appears of wrinkles as a result. My makeup goes on way smoother, however I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed a large difference in the appearance of puffy under eyes, which is also a concern of mine\\r\\nThe very compact texture and color is what stands out about this product, it makes your makeup look much more professional and thanks to its good quality it is unlikely that mistakes or unpleasant rubs on the skin will be made. It is an excellent product and of good quality.\\r\\nI recently recieved this through a subscription box . And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been enjoying using it. Amazing hydration. Has a nice thick texture that goes on smooth.\\r\\nI really have been enjoying this eye cream. It sits perfectly under my makeup which is something I struggle to find due to my dry skin. Leaves your under eye area smithed and replenished.\\r\\nThis made my eyes soooooo hydrated and I loved the cooling feeing I had while putting on. I am still in the preventative stage of eye creases so I cannot speak to if it helps those who already have them but this is so good for me to work into my routine! I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis moisturizing feels great on the eye area, under eye area looks better, feels so moisturized and refreshing I highly recommend this\\r\\nI received this as a sample and it is a great moisturizer! My concealer goes in sooo smoothly. If you need a eye moisturizer this is great choice but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all it does is moisturize. Sadly it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t de puff or help with dark circles. My under eye skin was so dry, it was scaly!! I tried tons of different products, even coconut oil didnt help. This eye cream cleared it up in one day! Its fast absorbing, non greasy and smells pretty good too. It\\'s more than I would have wanted to pay but worth the money.belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb \\r\\nI think most eye creams are a scam. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basically a smaller amount of a less concentrated product that costs more. Having said that, this felt really nice to apply around my eye area. The cream is super thick, so you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to use a lot of it. I think this jar could last a long time. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any real problems in my eye area, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to say if this product did anything other than hydrating.\\r\\nThis is such an amazing eye cream! It\\'s very moisturizing and preps the eye area so your concealer doesn\\'t look cakey. I\\'ve been trying to find something that compares at a lower price point, with no luck. My first jar was in a subscription box, and I\\'ll keep buying it!belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb \\r\\nI had tiny tester of this in beauty box and I was trying so hard to make it last for a while cause it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just such a good moisturizer. Very satisfied with this product and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unfortunately little too pricey for me but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely worth it\\r\\nI love how hydrating but lightweight this eye cream is. I love how well it works under makeup as well. Its a really good moisturizing eye cream.\\r\\nI received a sample of this product through Ipsy and really like how it makes my eyes feel refreshed. A good product that really moisturizes the eye area, especially on those tired days. I would recommend to others.\\r\\nMy go to eye cream! It says 72 hrs of moisture and it sure means it! My eyes get so dry and flaky in the winter and this has kept them hydrated super well! I only use it maybe once a week and i never have problems with my usual flakiness. I cant imagine the results if i were to ise it everyday!\\r\\nI wanted to love this product as much as I loved the moisturizer but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any results. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very cooling and has a smooth gel consistency. Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t repurchase this one.\\r\\nAfter receiving a sample packet in the mail, I bought some more of this and still love it. It is soothing and there is a noticeable difference in how my eyes look. The price is not too bad for an eye cream. The smell is a little blah but it doesn\\'t stink.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI got this in a set along with the face cream. I\\'m not a real believer in eye creams. I personally dont think you need both but that\\'s me. It\\'s a nice product.  Doesn\\'t irritate eyes. I\\'ve never tried product under makeup.\\r\\nNot a fan of the smell. I received as a sample and only used it once, I really cant get over the terrible smell. They need to remove the fragrance then maybe I can tolerate the product. I am not even sure if it works. \\r\\nThis helps with my fine lines dark circles. I didn\\'t take it with me on a trip and I looked like hell. It moisturizes well and plumps up my skin.\\r\\nI got a tiniest sample from sephora and I didnt think this was going to moisturize my under eyes but it does! It doesnt get rid of dark circles or puffiness but my under eyes to tend to get extremely dry and this takes care of that.\\r\\nI adore this!  I picked up a sample at Sephora.  It is gentle and layers beautifully over the serum I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been wearing around my eyes.  I am totally thinking of getting a full size when this runs out.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a delight to wear.  I wore it with makeup the other night and everything went on smoothly - no creases, easy to apply, just lovely.\\r\\nIt is moisturizing but a little tick for me. I have just been using it for a week but haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen any difference yet. Will keep you posting.\\r\\nwow i wish i had the money to buy more of this eye cream. amazing. so gentle and scent free and moisturizing and cruelty free. i had a deluxe sample and loved it so much, my skin looked so refreshed in the morning\\r\\nThis eye cream is one of this best eye moisturizer I have ever used. It is great for puffy eyes and the thick nature of it makes is easy to apply and doesn\\'t take much for the great effect. It is effective. I will definitely be buying again when I run low. Highly recommended.\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is a great product. It really works well. I have been experimenting more with eye creams lately, because I am now in my late 30s. This one is hands down the best that I have tried.\\r\\nI received my 5ml sample in my August Ipsy glam bag.  it doesn\\'t look like much, but it\\'s eye cream  (and a good one ) so you don\\'t need much.  I have been using nightly just short of a month,  and I am  SHOOK!!\\xe2\\x99\\xa1\\xe2\\x99\\xa1\\xe2\\x99\\xa1 I wish I did a before,  and after.  The results are great,  and almost a month in I still have more than half a tiny jar. FEEL FREE TO CHECK OUT IPSY THRU MY LINK \\xe2\\x99\\xa1\\xe2\\x99\\xa1. #IPSY #Belif #voxbox #influenster  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb #skinesetials\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb I got this sample on ipsy and I\\'m so in love with it. I Have several dark circles under my eyes and this really help reduce puffy dark under eyes and moisturize that delicate area. I use this on my day and night routine. When finish this sample. Definitely going to buy more...\\r\\nI love this product! I can feel it working as soon as I put it on and could tell small differences the next day! I also love the fact that it is made from natural ingredients. This product worked out better than I expected and I would definitely purchase it agian.\\r\\nI love an eye cream that I can also use as an eye mask. This fits the bill. It is such a light, airy texture that it really absorbs well but I can also use it to mask when my skin is deathly dry. The package size seems a little large, but honestly, in an eye cream, anything larger than a deluxe sample seems grossly oversized. It takes forever to get through a single container of eye cream! But this one is really lovely and the price point is quite nice. Overall I think it\\'s a good value and a solid performer.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI received a sample of this in a subscription box and I am OBSESSED with this stuff. I have used it every single day since receiving it. I have sensitive skin and have not experienced any burning or discomfort while using. I have noticed a difference under my eyes, less puffy in the morning. Would buy again! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb \\r\\nI really like this eye balm. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thick and long lasting and keeps your under eye area very hydrated.\\r\\nTHIS STUFF IS SO GOOD! I got a small sample in my ipsy bag for August and I\\'m honestly upset tht I liked it so much because it is a little pricey. But it\\'s honestly too good to resist buying the full size!\\r\\nI had a makeup artist tell me to use this before doing my makeup and it changed my life. Also it\\'s so beautiful on its own, my eyes look so dewy. my eyes don\\'t get watery or get little bumps under my eyes. So gentle!\\r\\nI do love it. I feel my eyes \\xc3\\xa1rea very moisturizer. I have very dry skin and that zone is not too firm any longer, so i hope it works. It smells amazing\\r\\nMy first impression on this product is that you feel your eyes getting refresh Automatically. \\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\x96\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xbc\\xe2\\x80\\x8d\\xe2\\x99\\x80\\xef\\xb8\\x8f I like the smell and my eyes really appreciate it . Will buy it later . I got it in my Ipsy bag\\r\\nI really like this product. It has a nice texture and feels super moisturizing. It leaves my eyes feeling so smooth and moisturized! I wouldn\\'t say that it reduces the appearance of eye wrinkles, or even fine lines though. I\\'m in my early 20s and notice some small fine lines around my eyes already, and no product will actually make them disappear as they claim, so if that is why you are looking to buy this product, I wouldn\\'t. If you are simpling looking for a good gentle eye cream, then this product is great.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really impressed with the moisturizer I received from this brand but I was excited when I saw I was going to get this eye bomb cream because of its raving reviews. The texture is incredible and deeply nourishes my eyes. It is perfect for a night routine! I love the way it feels and cools around my puffy tired eyes. I also love how it smells!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on the fence about this eye cream, it does work really well for hydration but It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work underneath makeup. It pills really bad and makes my concealer look splotchy. I use it mainly at night now but It still pills if I happen to rub at eyes, almost like it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sink in. For the price I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll repurchase.\\r\\nThis is one of my favorite eye creams. I am in love with the texture of this cream. It\\'s very rich and moisturizing, true to its name. It absorbs fast. While it\\'s very hydrating and I instantly feel an energized plump effect, I haven\\'t noticed any long term benefits with this eye cream.\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why I waited so long to try this #eyecream the name fits perfect cause it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s #bomb I love it! It leaves your eye area so hydrated and moisturized without feeling greasy. Please everyone give it a try! You won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t regret it. And for the price I think you get quite a lot of product so definitely worth it!!!\\r\\nI have not tried many eye creams, but this one tops all others and my expectations. Instantly, I can see color correction, inflation decrease, and an overall hydrated look. Within a couple days/weeks of using it - I started to noticed my crows feet on my eyes decreasing as well!! When I cry, I can put this on my eye and it will make it look like I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been crying at all. So moisturizing. You do not need a lot! A little goes a long way and can last a lot. The price is high, but it does truly last so long. Here is a picture before (left) and after application (right) just after only a minute of having it on.\\r\\nAnother product from this company that I\\'m absolutely in love with this is one of the most moisturizing eye creams that I have come across and trust me I\\'ve tested a lot it\\'s extremely affordable and most definitely does not lack in performance you will definitely start seeing a difference in about seven days it reduces looks of fine lines and wrinkles and puffiness around the eyes.. definitely a go to products definitely would recommend to others\\r\\nI got this as a sample in one of my Sephora purchases and I really enjoyed this product. It is extremely hydrating for the under-eyes, although I did notice it made my skin feel slightly more greasy afterwards. I have oily acne-prone sensitive skin so I typically stay away from products that tend to make me feel greasy at the end of the day. For all the dry skin gal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s out there I think this product would be bomb for you! It is very hydrating and has a nice scent when applying it to your under-eyes.\\r\\nAnother great Ipsy bag find! So I\\'d never heard of Belief before this cream arrived and I\\'m impressed, ended up buying a beginner set from them to try more of the products out. This eye cream was super moisturizing, applied well without feeling greasy and had next to no scent.\\r\\nThis product I received it in the traveling kit from belief and this cream has helped me moisturize my eyes and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look as dead as I usually look. Really like it and highly recommend you guys to buy it !\\r\\nBEST EYE CREAM THERE IS. This stuff is magic. It got rid of my fine line, dry skin, and rough texture within a couple uses. I really like all of the belif products. Definitely will recommend to anyone looking for a hydrating eye cream.\\r\\nIt must be noted, that my first skincare product from the Belif brand I have got from the Influenster! I have already written a review about this product and my mind still the same. Even though I have used two more pots of this cream. For my pretty young skin, it suits well. It moisturizes the skin good, and I have no problems with my next makeup on it. This cream is light but for me, it is enough even in winter time!\\r\\nI have used various eye products. This is by far my favorite! When you apply it (use your ring finger) it wakes your skin right up with a cooling hydrating effect. A little goes a long way. Your eyes will show the first signs of aging so it is important to use a product that works.. unless you want to risk fine lines.. I do feel like the product is a tad pricey but since a little goes a long way in the full picture it is not that bad. Using this under your foundation will help your make up last! When your skin is dry it pulls moisture from your makeup. This appears to fade your makeup. Instead of reapplying.. use an eye cream!\\r\\nI got this as a sample size from my Sephora play box & o how I fell in love with and went & got the full size & then got another sample from another play box...yay! This eye product hydrates and makes my under eye look so bright and healthy! Smooth and easy to blend, don et irritates the eye at all and just simple to use.\\r\\nI actually really like this. It is very thick so you don\\'t need to use a lot and it really is hydrating.  Pros: Incredibly thick balm. Truly does moisturize around the eyes.  Cons: It\\'s a little pricey.\\r\\nI use this at night but also sometimes during the day( it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s light enough to wear under makeup) provides great hydration for under the eye\\r\\nI love this product and have used it previously. This product is lightweight and you can see the affect of it a few minutes after application. After application you can feel the hydration happening under your eyes. I love that this product doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have an fragrance. #influenster #eye cream #hydrating  #sephora #belif #belifinhydration #honest #summer2020 #summerpicks #free #complimentary #voxbox #springintosummer #springintosummervoxbox\\r\\nThis is by far my favorite eye cream! It Thick but not too thick. Really adds alot of hydration to the undereye.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI was really hoping this was going to be one of my cult favorites but it fell short for me. It is a very light weight eye cream. However, I felt it did nothing for my under eye. Did it add moisture no, I felt it actually dried my under eye area out. The most I liked about the cream was that it was super light weight.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nSAVES YOUR UNDEREYES. If you have dry undereyes that when you put concealer on it looks dry, cakey and just not appealing, this moisturizer will help. After applying a pea sized amount under your eyes on day 2 I noticed such a difference in the texture and look of my undereyes. They looked very fresh and smooth and no longer dry. Concealer looks so much better and I just feel better overall. This works wonders on your eyes.\\r\\nI enjoy this eye balm, I usually apply it once my face is dry after my shower time. I really like the fact that it improves skin elasticity . The only flaw I would say it has is that it seems to get into my eyes without me even touching them, it could be something in the eye bomb that makes my eyes water, but once I try to scratch them the first time of course by this time it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all in my eyes. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d maybe say be careful not to wear it in too hot weather due to extra sweating around the eye area\\r\\nWell, eye cream. I felt like it was a waste of money to be very honest. Having never used an eye cream before, except for my eye stick, I felt like I wasn\\'t going to use it, but wasn\\'t I wrong?!I brought this one to my dorm actually, so that I could use it there. Its a cute sample size. But it makes my eyes feel so hydrated!!!This eye cream has a rather strong herbal scent, which might not appeal to everyone. If you\\'ve already tried the Aqua Bomb, you\\'re most likely already familiar with the scent. It\\'s almost the same. I personally stop smelling it once it has absorbed into the skin. I don\\'t mind the scent too much, but I get that others might not like it.The texture is very creamy and lightweight, and it sinks in really quickly. it does leave somem sort of balmy texture behind though, but you only notice it when you touche it with your finger. It makes my skin smooth and hydrated. I am a big fan!\\r\\nPretty good but SO overpriced! I got a sample of this in my Sephora Play! box and it was nice, but not quite hydrating and firming as I like my eye creams to be. This isn\\'t as good as my Innisfree Orchid Eye cream and is three times the price. You can get better eye creams for half the price of this.\\r\\nLOVEE THIS CREAM! One of my favorites . I use it almost every night and I love the texture.\\r\\nI got this in a subscription box and was super excited because belif The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb is my favorite moisturizer ever.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been testing out this eye cream and I love it.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydrating, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too thick where you cannot wear it under makeup. It feels so good when applied too, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of thin and spreads easily and absorbs really well.\\r\\nGreat stuff! It has made such a difference with my makeup routine by smoothing out the texture wrinkles underneath my eyes. Now my foundation and my concealer go on so much smoother. It\\'s such a hydrating product I really like it.\\r\\nSuper easy to apply. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s light weight and not heavy. Packaging is sooo cute as well! I got this in one of my monthly subscription boxes and fell in love! Def can see a difference in my eyes and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helped with the dark circles and leaves my under eyes sooo soft!\\r\\nFirst of all belif is one of my favorite skincare brands. I love their toners and hydrating moisturizers. I like this eye cream a lot but all it did to me after trying it the past 6 weeks daily was it kept my under eyes moisturized, hydrated and smooth. It helped a lot with this cold winter weather. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it did anything with my fine lines or brightened up my under eyes. I would recommend it to someone who is looking for an eye cream that hydrates your eyes and keep them smooth. I have normal to dry skin and my skin gets a lot dryer in the winter when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cold outside. I personally would consider purchasing it when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cold outside since my skin gets dryer around this weather and it needs a lot of hydration. If you are like me and looking for products that reduce your fine lines and brighten up your eyes then this might not be your number one option but if you are looking for hydration then this is your product.\\r\\nI was very moisturizing as promised. A little goes a long way so this product will last you a long time.\\r\\nLove this! The texture is amazing, it absorbs fast, and my eyes look great thanks to it! :)\\r\\nThis is one of those products that I did not fully appreciate until I was out of it. I used it during the winter, both night and day, and it left my under eye area so moisturized! It wasn\\'t too heavy or too light, which made it perfect for night or day use. Would repurchase and would recommend!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis is the only eye cream that I see any noticeable results with. It is so lightweight, yet it is super potent and packs a punch of hydration. I have very dark circles, this is the only product that noticeably brightens them.\\r\\nI received this eye cream from Influenster in a vox box. I already love the Belif brand so I knew this would be a great product. I love this eye cream! I have always suffered from dark under eye circles and puffiness in the morning. It\\'s hard to find a cream that doesn\\'t irritate my sensitive eyes or make my concealer look bad over it. Not only does this cream hydrate, smooth, and soothe my eyes but concealer looks great over it! No creasing and no dryness! Plus it feels so cool and refreshing on the skin. Definitely recommend it and I will be purchasing another jars when it\\'s gone.\\r\\nI love this product! The belief Moisturizing Eye Bomb was sent to me complimentary to test out from Influenster. It has exceeded all of my expectations. It truly does moisturize my eye area as well as plump up my fine lines. This cream wears great all day long and works excellent under my concealer. I will definitely be purchasing this product in the future.\\r\\nThis is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used.You don\\'t have to use a whole lot for it to be effective.I use quite a variety of sephora products.You definitely get what you pay for with this product!\\r\\nI have been loving the belif products so much lately. They\\'re so great on the skin. I\\'ve had so many problems with skincare products making my skin oilier then it already is. These don\\'t do that! Love love\\r\\nThis eye balm is so soothing and give so much moisture ! I love this and how lovely this feels on the skin ! Great formula\\r\\nThis is one of the best face cream I ever had. It so rich and moisturizing that it is worth every ounce that it costs. It is so effective in keeping my skin moisturize and soft. For the value, I can say it is worth it and I will recommend this to all of my friends. I will buy it again definitely!\\r\\nLove this is much works amazing just what it says it does it does !!!! You need this in your life the price is very agreed\\r\\nThis eye cream works pretty well. It removed all puffiness under my eyes. It also made all the time lines disappeared as well. It felt very light weight and goes on really easy and makes your eye area very smooth and soft getting rid of all your troubling dry areas.\\r\\nI got it as a sample for my points from Sephora. Not good, bot bad . To me it gave a zero hydratation , but also didnt irritate at all. I am 34 y old. I need smthg stronger with action, i guess\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 and more nourishing. The texture of this guy is very very light! So i suppose it will work very good for somebody on their 20s!\\r\\nI really love to try this Produkt for me. I really need fory eyes a refresh. #Influenster #voxbox i hope i will try it soon. Thank you! \\r\\nMy eyes drank it uppppp. I first tried it a sample with purchase with the full size bomb moisturizer. Then I enjoyed it and got a full size bottle. Make sure to close it all the way bc I get so lazy and it gets dried easily :(\\r\\nThis is nice and moisturizing, unscented which is preferable for skin care. I don\\'t think it does much else for my under eye area but it doesn\\'t hurt to moisturize. I\\'m just not sure I\\'d spend the money on it to purchase again. Packaging is attractive.\\r\\nI received a sample of this product for free from Influenster to review. I greatly enjoyed it. You only need one or two light taps of the product. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take much at all to moisturize under your eyes.\\r\\nI have been using this for a month and a half day and night. This eye cream is great to keep under eyes moisturized and I really enjoy the creamy gel consistency. It is a tiny bit greasy, and does take a bit to absorb. While I like it -- it\\'s not life changing.  I think it does help lightly with dark circles. I didn\\'t notice anything change while using it as far as firmness or fine lines. I\\'m not sure I would pay the $50 for this after testing it out a month. The Dr Brandt DNA peptide eye cream gives me way more hydration than this one does but, it\\'s also almost twice the price. I don\\'t have sensitive skin but I have reactive skin. I didn\\'t notice any redness or irritation.\\r\\nMy gf uses it and I have been using some of hers and really enjoy it and find it moisturizing.\\r\\nI wanted to like this product but I just didn\\'t see the results I wanted. The gel itself is lightweight af, cool & soothing. Not for someone looking to undo some damage. More for maintenance\\r\\nAbsolutely loveeeeeee this line of products! As I tend to get oily these gel type moisturizers work well for me as they keep me hydrated without a greasy feeling left behind. Excellent brand!\\r\\nThis product really helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles. It smells good and is easy to use. I have noticed my eyes look and feel brighter and less wrinkled.\\r\\nI got this in my allure beauty box and I already ordered a full size!!!! I love getting makeup and skincare subscriptions because if I love something I just go out and buy it and now I see this is an Influenster 2020 fave . Lol well it\\'s one of my faves too!!! Thank you Allure ..\\r\\nI really do like this ice cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expensive so I rarely ever buy it but it really does do wonders\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nI was dealing with dry spots on my eyelids during the dry winter season and I found this eye cream to be the best at hydrating! It truly lives up to its name in that it provides a moisture bomb. I love the more watery consistency as it makes it lightweight, easy to apply and soaks in so quickly!\\r\\nI LOVE all belif products ! I always have atleast two on hand because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m scared to run out ! The price can be expensive individually but there are often gift sets I buy which allows me to have all their products at a great price! This makes my skin feel so moisturizer, the eye cream is very soothing! I love it !\\r\\nA very lightweight formula that absorbs quickly into skin. I have very dry under eyes, and although this does hydrate, it has not been the holy grail for my dry, tired eyes. I like to keep it on hand as a back up for those less dry days. You only need a small bit so the product lasts a long time.\\r\\nI have tried many eye creams from different brands and this one tops them all! It is so moisturizing and leaves my eye area hydrated. This and their aqua bomb cream and sleeping mask are a permanent part of my regimen.\\r\\nLove using this before bed. I wake up feeling fresh and super hydrated but not greasy. Planning to continue using this in the future!\\r\\nUse this daily with my face cream. Glides on super smooth and is not sticky at all. Very hydrating and smells great too!\\r\\nDidn\\'t notice a difference at all. Has a scent. made me break out and my eyes got red, itchy and irritated. Wouldn\\'t purchase again.\\r\\nThis product is amazing. Goes on so nice. Very moisturizing. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it helps much with wrinkles but I would still use it.\\r\\nSuch a light and fluffy eye moisturizer. It is really soothing (I recommend keeping it in the fridge if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re puffy). It also does not have much of a scent, perfect for sensitive skin, definitely a great go to product.\\r\\nLOVE this eye cream!  It\\'s super hydrating and versatile for both night and day.  I\\'ve recommended it to several friends who also rave about it.  \\r\\nSuper hydrating for that delicate eye area. Use at night and under makeup. Feels refreshing and soothing. A little goes a long way.\\r\\nThis is a great eye cream. It is not too heavy so it can be great for under makeup but it is still hydrating enough for nighttime.\\r\\nMost moisturizing and hydrating eye cream EVER. If you are super dry, this also helps to put a little on your face and it will be baby soft! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s their best product.\\r\\nProbably the most hydrating eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used! A thicker cream especially good for the winter cold months! I apply this right before concealer and it goes on so smoothly!belif\\r\\nGood moisturizing lightweight daytime eye cream. Good for under makeup and plumps under eye\\r\\nJust a beautiful finish under any product and just on it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on at night works beautifully! Love how my eyes look during and after use of this gel!\\r\\nThis is a wonderful eye cream if looking for intense hydration. I have used a full sized jar and have not seen any other effects - did not lighten dark circles, or decrease wrinkles but did a fantastic job moisturizing!!! Did not aggrevate eyes  which is a common issue with my eyes!  Great feel and scent. Highly recommend if moisture is what your eyes crave!\\r\\nLove this product! Actually, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a big fan of their gel moisturizer too. Melts into my skin and never seems to make my eyes burn like to many other eye creams. Received this as a sample and then bought the full size.\\r\\nI used to have deep dark circles around my eyes until I started using the eye bomb. it\\'s definitely worth the money to buy it and use it As a daily cream.\\r\\nThis is my go-to eye cream. Very moisturizing and it absorbs quickly. The container lasts a long time and I like to buy the little travel sets so I have a small one in my travel bag. \\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nThis eye cream feels awesome on the skin! It preps my under-eye area for concealer beautifully. It temporarily will plump up the sallow part of my under-eye that needs it the most and it makes my eyes appear to be more awake and youthful while wearing it.\\r\\nSuper moisturizing! I loved using this before bed or under my makeup. It made my under eye skin feel hydrated\\r\\nI just recently started to notice that under my eyes were not getting enough moisture, and this product really did the trick with adding moisture without irritation! In the past, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found that some products are either very heavy or burn, but this one has been perfect! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great because it moisturizes enough to where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed that the lines under my eyes are no longer as visible, but is light enough to wear under makeup. Highly recommend!\\r\\nThis product is definitely very hydrating! I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for hydration, I wish it had more benefits to it like brightening or anti-aging but over all a good hydrating eye cream. Not something I would reach for again.\\r\\nI got a mini version of this and used it until it was done! Its a great eye moisturizer to use for your AM and PM skin routine\\r\\nThis feels so good on my eyes and is very moisturizing, The price point is amazing. I could see this possibly replacing my tried and true Est\\xc3\\xa9e Lauder. It absorbs super fast and plumps up the fine lines around my eyes shaving at least 5 years off my face.\\r\\nEiner der besten Augencremes die ich probiert hab! Beruhigt die Haut, versorgt sie mit Feuchtigkeit und Schwellungen werden gemildert. Hatte bislang keine Probleme mit ihr.\\r\\nUse this everyday under my eyes mornings and night and I no longer have dry cracked skin on the sides of my eyes!\\r\\nReally like this one. I use it for hydration since my eyes get dry due to eczema. I love how it feels so cool when you apply it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gentle on the skin. I wish it helped with dark circles\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\xad. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affordable.\\r\\nThis feels nice under the eyes - it has a little bit of a thicker cream consistency which I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expecting based on the Aqua Bomb moisturizer from Belif. My under eyes feel hydrated and pretty smooth - it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sink into the skin 100%, but just enough where I would hope makeup would sit nicely on top of this in the AM.\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s truly so moisturizing and definitely helps prevent signs of aging. Belif products are the best out there.\\r\\nPerfect eye moisturizer! It smells fresh and a little bit goes a long way. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only used samples so far but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll definitely add it to my next purchase\\r\\nmi crema hidratante es muy buena y te deja la piel fresca limpia y suave me gusta su textura y tiene un olor que por lo particular a mi me gusta mucho se los recomiendo y no cambiaria nada\\r\\nIt does feel hydrating but I just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any other benefits with this product. If all you need Is under eye hydration, then go for It !\\r\\nBest eye cream ever! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so smooth and hydrating. I love the whole Belif skin care line.\\r\\nHydrantant et parfait pour les yeux sensibles! Je ne peux dire par contre si cela a un impact sut les signes de l\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xc3\\xa2ge puisque que je ne l\\xe2\\x80\\x99utilise pas depuis assez longtemps pour voir une diff\\xc3\\xa9rence\\r\\nLove this eye cream for day time under my eyes keeps my skin moisturized and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t effect my makeup application\\r\\nLiterally my favorite eye cream. a little pricey but definitely worth it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so hydrating and exactly as advertised. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably purchase this the rest of my life lol\\r\\nI love this eye cream so much. One of the best I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever tried. I initially got this as a sample but decided to buy the full sized product. This eye cream feels so luxurious and moisturizing yet lightweight. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s significant difference in how my undereye area looks since I started using this product.\\r\\nThe perfect eye cream under makeup. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a light gel but still really moisturizing. The price isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cheap so although I liked it, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t anything mind blowing for me to repurchase this. Overall good eye cream if you are willing to splurge or don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have wrinkles yet :)\\r\\nA little product goes a long way. I have been using this product for a while and it moisturizes my undereye area really well. I will consider repurchasing, because it is a pricey product\\r\\nI like this! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing that is life changing but it does a great job hydrating and sits well under makeup. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great starter eye cream\\r\\nThe product itself is great! Very hydrating and feels nice to the touch. I knocked off a star because while the blue part of the component is nice and heavy glass, the cap is just cheap plastic! For the price I want the experience to feel more luxurious.\\r\\nThis stuff is amazing! Feels amazing on the skin. Is a little bit pricey but is worth it and you use very little! Plus I like the smell and clean scent.\\r\\nI really like the light texture of this! I received a free sample of it in one of my subscription boxes and became a fan of it. It is gentle and really leaves a nice impression under my eyes. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if I would purchase the full size one but it definitely wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a disappointment. I keep it in my fridge for a nice cooling effect.  Highlights: \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 provides intense moisture (for up to 26 hours) \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 boosts elasticity \\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nLove this cream! Its moisturizing but light weight and doesn\\'t feel like its clogging my pores. My eyes look brighter and less tired which what we all want right? Looking forward to trying the cleansing balm next.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a big fan of belief products! This is a great moisturizer for the eye area, especially now in the cold winter months when my skin tends to really dry out. I like to use it in the morning and really makes my eyes look and feel more awake.\\r\\nLa crema ha una consistenza leggera e fresca, dovrebbe essere idratante ed io privandola da mesi posso dire di non aver notato molta differenza sul contorno occhi per quanto riguarda la sua idratazione  Non penso che la ricomprer\\xc3\\xb2 in futuro.\\r\\nthis is probably my favorite of all the eye creams i\\'ve tried over the years - which is almost a shame because it\\'s so expensive for something i don\\'t consider THAT important to my routine yet. but if i was going to drop major money on an eye cream, it\\'d be this one! it didn\\'t erase my dark circles but it did a pretty good job of lessening them.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nAnother great product that I had the pleasure of trying a sample of. Belif can be a tad expensive but I do think ther products are good and are worth the price tag! You definitely need a staple eye cream and this is close to becoming mine\\r\\nThis feels sooooo amazing . I was sent it free from influenster and I will buy it from now on. It feel soothing when applying . It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the right amount of thickness . I look forward to applying this everyday!\\r\\nI really enjoy this eye balm it\\'s a part of my nightly routine it keeps under eyes soft and plump with no dry patches works nice under concealer to. Highly recommend.\\r\\nThis eye cream is the literally the bomb!!! I\\'m a sucker for eye creams and toners and my eye cream collection is ridiculously large! It is super moisturizing.\\r\\nI love the texture and consistency of this eye cream. Its a little thick but in a silky way so it doesnt feel too heavy\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb ok so I actually like this one and when I used it awhile back I immediately saw my under-eyes depuffing like instant so I had to jump on this. Its very rich and fast absorbing.  If you want results I suggest get on this like today. The whole brand is great and all their products I love\\r\\nHands-down, one of the best eye creams I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used. It had a similar texture to the tatcha silk eye cream which is my #1 fav. It is light enough to wear under makeup, but still packs on the moisture.\\r\\nThis formula feels great on the eye- not too heavy but not too light either. My eyes look refreshed when the next day when I use this at night\\r\\nLo llevo utilizando ya 3 meses en mi rutina nocturna eh visto un gran cambio ..me ayudado con el cansancio de mis ojeras siento m\\xc3\\xa1s l\\xc3\\xbacida el \\xc3\\xa1rea de mis ojos\\r\\nOne of my favorite eye cream\\xef\\xbf\\xbc it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s literally amazing keep my under eye area smooth in a very short time \\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nSOOOO I am an makeup artist and I love bold eyeshadow looks but genetically I have visibly VERY dark eye bags around my whole eye and because I wear a lot on my eye ( primer, concealer , shadow.. etc) my eyelids have become SO patchy .. ughhh and I never wanted to splurge on an eye cream but somehow I got convinced I need a good one regardless of the price because I need it to work. Eyeshadow wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even stick to my eyes because how much they were dry and within one day of using this my eyes have become brighter, so much softer and overall so hydrated and happy and I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask for a better product. I love the sheseido eye cream but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wayyyy over my budget . You should try this out for yourself . Comes with such a generous amount as well! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis is a pretty nice eye cream but I feel like it doesn\\'t really do anything for me long term. It hydrates nicely and makes my under eyes look relatively smooth but I can still see all the fine lines and my dark circles just look wet lol. I like it and use it often as I\\'ve received multiple samples of this but it\\'s just not the best eye cream I\\'ve tried.\\r\\nKeeps my undereye hydrated and ready for makeup application. Its a little pricey but the jar will last a long time.  I use it every night and in the morning.\\r\\nI really like this eye gel cream . It is very soothing and fresh under the eyes. Very. Very refreshing. I also liked that I had no allergic reaction. So if you have sensitive skin I highly recommend it.\\r\\nLoving the jelly feeling. Good with makeup and not creating creases under eye. Small jar goes for a long time. Maybe a little tool take product from the jar will be good for long nail ladies :)\\r\\nA very hydrating eye balm that I loved using in the morning. Lightweight, no scent, and left my eyes feeling nice. I have no complaints besides the price point. A good eye product!\\r\\nI tried this a few times it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydrated an full of moisture but I just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the feel of this on my face and to me it felt a little sticky I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care for that as much cute packaging but just not my cup of tea\\r\\nThis product really reduced my puffy eyes. And brightens my eyes from looking like a zombie every time. If u want to try it then go ahead it is worth it. Nice packaging and is effective\\r\\nI am a big fan of Belif products. This is an awesome eye bomb. I use it before going to sleep. It makes the under eye areas and eyelids hydrated and I feel refreshed. Much better than other eye creams I have used! Definitely recommend! #influensteraward2020\\r\\nIt has helped me lot, usually use in night and I pay much more, keeps me eyes hydrated and fresh, use simply amounts when it comes to that aplicare make-up, but my in personally I will good to be honest\\r\\nThis is my favorite 2020 eye moisturizer. It applies smooth with immediate results. I highly recommend you buying this product.   belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8dI use this every time I wash my face which even though it says it\\'s good for up to 26 hours, I still reapply because who wants dry skin around their eyes? I have not experienced any irritation with this and I have sensitive skin. So if you want to try a new eye cream go for this one!\\r\\nSimilar to the aqua bomb I find this moisturizer to be light and leaves eyes feeling refreshed\\r\\nCompletely eliminates creasing! Perfect primer for under eyes. Better than any other primer or eye cream I have tried. I wish that it did more for puffiness and dark circles though. Its hydrating, works perfectly under makeup but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much else. I look for a hydrating, firming eye cream that minimizes the look and feel of puffy, tired eyes. I have other hydrating eye creams that are just as hydrating.. they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make such a beautiful canvas for my concealer though! I would use a more potent eye cream at night but considered using this during the day because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so good under my concealer. It has such a lightweight, fresh feel and scent. This really does what it says but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just not right for me, I decided to go for a do it all eye cream instead!\\r\\nI got this as a sample from Sephora. I like the cream to gel formula and it has a nice beachy floral scent. My main concern is dark circles and this is definitely not targeted at that but rather hydration and fine lines.\\r\\nSuper moisturizing jelly consistency. Perfect for puffy eyes in the morning. The best eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried so far.\\r\\nmis sue\\xc3\\xb1os quedan seguros pues en la noches est\\xc3\\xa1 crema hidrata mis zona de ojos para lucir radiante durante todos el d\\xc3\\xada es de muy buena y te ayuda mucho con estos problemas adem\\xc3\\xa1s e prevenir l\\xc3\\xadneas indeseadas desde la primer aplicaci\\xc3\\xb3n es buenisisma\\r\\nI love eye cream and love this brand so it was a win win. I do not use this particular product for anti aging but I do use it to moisturize my eye area. So its good in the morning and also goes well under makeup. I would recommend this product for moisturizing the eye area.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It makes my under eye hydrated and smooth. I felt like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s improving the texture of the skin too. Well goes under makeup. Help calm dryness and flakiness. Love consistency and cute packaging. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pricey though. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis helps a lot with darker under eyes, if your skin is on the drier side I would definitely recommend this!\\r\\nEs dise\\xc3\\xb1ado proporcionar elastisidad en el area de los ojos resfreca y difumina las primeras lineas de expresion ideal para todas las pieles\\r\\nGreat eye moisturizer. It feels cool going on and helps my makeup apply smooth around my eyes. I received it in an Allure box, so Allure gets credit again for introducing me to a great product\\r\\nI struggle with dark circles and I found this to be the most helpful eye cream to improve my dark circles and my fine lines.\\xef\\xbf\\xbc It is on the pricier side however I find that the value is completely worth it and the product lasts a long time. When you apply it it gives a refreshing feeling to your under eyes and makes your eyes feel more awake.\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nReceived this as a sample. Not particularly impressed...a bit too greasy for my preference, and additionally doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to do a lot...still it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heavy enough so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moisturizing to say the least. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m unlikely to purchase this.\\r\\nGreat product for the eyes. Goes on smooth, dries quick, and does feel like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tightening the eye area once it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dry. A little goes a long way with this product.\\r\\nI have no under eye concerns. But I can tell you that his cream is nice and didnt irritate my skin. A little goes a long way. Medium thickness consistency. \\r\\nI expected more out of this. It was moisturizing but didn\\'t really do what it claimed it would for the under eye area.\\r\\nI have tried a few of they\\'re products I do recommend belief and do say so myself that my skin is left feeling so clean smooth and ultra soft. But u have to consistently use. I will repurchase.\\r\\nThis should\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve lasted me along time but it only lasted me a short while because I loved using it so much. I liked the way it made the corners of my eyes feel. I always wake up with extremely dry skin and cracking around my eyes but this got rid of it in less than 3 weeks\\r\\nMy favorite! Light yet extremely hydrating. Perfect for daytime as it sinks in quickly and works great underneath makeup.\\r\\nSmells exactly like the aqua moisturizing cream. My first time using it - really hydrated the under-eye area. It\\'s super lightweight (perfect for the heat and summer). Would highly recommend buying the trial pack that they have at Sephora so you can try before buying!\\r\\nThis is the best eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used so far! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lighter gel cream texture but still very hydrating under the eyes. Comes in a large 25ml jar and will last forever since you only need a tiny bit. Wears well under makeup or as an overnight cream. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t comment on whether it helps dark circles (I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really have them) but it definitely keeps dry patches at bay and leaves my undereyes feeling plump!\\r\\nI bought this as part of a Belif Aqua Bomb tester set and I enjoyed all of the products. This eye balm is super moisturizing, goes on and absorbs well. Leaves my eye area well hydrated and the texture is fantastic. Youbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb only need a small amount of product, it really goes a long way. I do recommend this product as well as the entire line of Belif Aqua Bomb products, they are really great products! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nGot this product from @influenster for FREE! It works like magic! Softens the eye lids and moisturizes. Anazing product.\\r\\nMy absolute favorite eye cream ever! I have sensitive and dry under eyes and this is literally the bomb! I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll ever live without it! Cute packaging as well!\\xef\\xbf\\xbc. This is super emollient, has a wonderful texture, no scent.\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nDo yourself a favor and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t spend $48 on this eye cream. I have dry eyelids and this did not keep them moisturized for 26 hours, like it claims. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even keep them moisturized for half the day. The Cerave Eye Repair Cream , Cetaphil Hydrating Eye Gel-Cream , or [product:mario-badescu-hyaluronic-eye-cream-14ml/05oz] are way better than this one and way cheaper. The only positive I have is the smell is nice and if you put it in the fridge if feels very cooling.\\r\\nA good hydrating eye cream. I would say it is very basic for an eye cream. It was gentle which I liked.\\r\\nGreat eye cream I really like to use it, I put it under my eyes during the night and the next morning I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m like new.\\r\\nVery moisturizing and feels good on my eyes in general. I got this in a vox box and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and thickness.\\r\\nThis little tiny bottle makes my eye feels like 2 years younger! I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it plumped the under part of my eye instantaneously after use and it felt hydrated all day! I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel tired anymore even when going to sleep at 2am and getting only 5 hours sleep. Love it! \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x95\\r\\nBest eye cream for dry eyes. It hydrates, plumps and helps with those dark circles. Feels very cooling on the under eye as well\\r\\nBelief Moisturizing Eye Bomb este eye cream \\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x81 te ayuda a humectar por 26 horas y proporciona elasticidad a tu piel #belifinhydration #contest #complimentary @belifusa @Influenster\\r\\nI really want this to work, but I can\\'t use it. I don\\'t think I have sensitive skin, but my undereye got very red and tingley after use. Eventually it actually started to hurt a little! Unfortunately, I can\\'t keep using this. Maybe this would help my dark circles but I\\'d rather try a different eye cream.\\r\\nThis is a great hydrating day time eye cream for summer. The formula is lightweight and helps my concealer looks smoother under my eyes. I love that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightweight so you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel it on at all! Also great for sensitive eyes and skin!\\r\\nMe encanta esta crema se siente s\\xc3\\xbaper suave al tacto, mi piel lo absorbe s\\xc3\\xbaper r\\xc3\\xa1pido y lo que m\\xc3\\xa1s me gusta es que me hidrata la piel... Y cuando uso maquillaje se me ve hidratada de igual manera!!\\r\\nReally hydrating for how lightweight the product is! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very light gel cream, sinks in quickly but is very hydrating and wears well under makeup. A little goes a long way so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still working my way through a sample for the past few months. It does have a heavy fragrance and I would prefer it to be in a squeeze tube so 1 star off. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t comment on whether it helps with lines and wrinkles since I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have this issue.\\r\\nMy go to eye cream is belif eye bomb. Very light and not sticky. I would definitely recommend.\\r\\nAmazing!!! I have been using the aqua bomb for a face moisturizer for years so I was really excited about this product. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great price for how much product you get and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really concentrated so you barely need to use any. It feels very moisturizing without feeling oily and makes me eyes feel so refreshed and hydrated.\\r\\nI love this stuff it lasts a long time and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect lightweight for summer or hotter weather makes indersyes plump and sinks in almost instantly\\r\\nThis product was super smooth and awesome! The product helped my under eyes when I used it nightly. A great addition to my skincare routine!! I got this from the complimentary Spring Into Summer VoxBox!\\r\\nLove this eye bomb!!!! I apply this under my eyes before my moisturizer. It helps brighten my face and makes my skin feel so refreshed. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed a huge difference since I started using this. A little dab of this goes a long way.\\r\\nBasically I love all skin care products which are water based and ofcourse this eye bomb is just perfect. I use it every night in my skin care routine and it has made a noticiable change to how my undereyes look like now and I am impressed.\\r\\nThis is my go to eye cream for sure. A little goes a long way so it is definitely worth the money.\\r\\nSuper amazing eye cream! I love it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always refreshing putting it on under my eyes\\r\\nI love using this eye cream along with Belif face cream.It absorbs instantly under your eyes and they feel so moisturized and refreshed.I really love the fresh scent of this eye cream as well.The ingredients are fantastic as well.Under my eyes feel great when using this\\r\\nI love this under eye bomb I use it every time I do my glam looks it really hydrates the under eye if you have any fine lines or dryness. Gentle enough for sensitive skin! A little goes a long way, it really lasts !\\r\\nI got this with my moisturizer and I love it. It really keeps my under eyes hydrated. On the days I don\\'t sleep well and I put this on and my eyes look so refreshed\\r\\nI really love this eye cream. It deeply hydrates the eye area and gently nourishes the skin. Also safe for sensitive skin\\r\\nI love this so much! Super east to apply and does the job super quick! Definitely recommend it for eye bags or dark circles. I wish it has a better smell but it\\'s easy to get used to. Packaging is super easy to deal with! Definitely worth the price as well\\r\\nLove this eye cream . Its very good. Love Belif products. I will use over and over again . I need to buy sleep mask too\\r\\nI really liked this eye bomb. Little goes a long way. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super moisturizing and absorbs easily into the thin skin around my eyes. I would love it more if it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the fragrance.\\r\\nI got to try a variation of this from an influencer box I got I thought it was a great moisturizer I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used ones that I liked more tho. I have dry skin and I just love ones that keep my skin supple for longer than this did. For someone who likes product that soaks/absorbs in pretty quickly this would be the perfect fit for them\\xef\\xbf\\xbc.\\r\\nI really like the gel texture and how fast it absorbs into my skin. It is really hydrating. However, as much as I want to love it, I can smell the fragrance and it may have cause the tiny bumps (they are not red and do not hurt) around my eyes. I kinda regret trying it after I noticed the bumps. Thankfully I only got the free sample.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI love anything skin care! After receiving this in my #SpringToSummerVoxbox I am in love!

Probably won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t but it again bc of the price\\r\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for a hydrating eye cream then this is for you! The value is great for a Korean brand & Belif is a great brand. Mostly for people looking to get rid of the dryness around the eye area but not for darkness. This is lightweight hydrating eye cream! \\r\\nI had never tried an under eye cream until I got this in my Voxbox. My favorite thing about it is the texture and how it feels on my skin. There\\'s something very soothing about it that makes it feel luxurious. I also love how moisturized it leaves my skin feeling and the long lasting effect it has. \\r\\nSo I literally just got this product today & let me just say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing. I put it on 40 mins ago and it still feels moisturized. It smells natural not like other products that have fragrances. I used a pea size drop for each eye, and trust me a little goes a long way.

I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure it helped with puffiness, but then again I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it claimed that on the packaging. Overall, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d definitely recommend this product. #springintosummervoxbox\\r\\nI love trying out eye moisturizers to see which one works best for me.

I mean, who doesn\\'t?\\r\\nReceived this as part of the #springinfluenstervoxbox   I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so picky about my eye creams- this one gave a cooking effect which actually helped my mom circles out sooo much-  felt so light weight but definitely the ultimate hydration that that thin layer of skin needed \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xaf I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sold on this one belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis has been my regular eye cream for 3 empties now. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m currently using a belif sister product (belif Peat Miracle Revital Eye Cream) which is just as good, but I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably switch back over to this guy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great prevention and keeps the under eye so hydrated! My concealer glides on after using this routinely!\\r\\nI really enjoy this eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very smooth and lightweight. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen a huge difference but I do feel like it moisturizes. The cream has no smell which is great.\\r\\nI love this cream so much.                                     Its very gentle and gets rid of my dark circles, even if I stay up late for uni work. I highly recommend this product as it is very effective.\\r\\nI also got this in my #springintosummervoxbox and I have use Belif for the longest time maybe around 5 years and I have never had a problem with their products. This product smells good and feels really refreshing under the eyes.\\r\\nI received this in my complementary Voxbox. It is so creamy and great under the eye. #beliefinhydration @beliefusa\\r\\nEste producto puede ser peque\\xc3\\xb1o pero con un efecto extraordinario lo ame me encanto , creo que lo a\\xc3\\xb1adire a mi rutina es super refrescante kita las lineas de expression es super bueno y sobre todo fue free por influenster  mil gracias por la oportunidad   belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI got this in an ipsy bag and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of my favorite eye creams ever. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really lightweight but still really hydrating. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried only a few eye creams, but all of them besides this one has been heavy or too thick. Just in general, they usually sit on the skin instead of getting absorbed (whatever you wanna call it). But the fill size is SO EXPENSIVE and I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find travel sizes or anything for sale. This is worth it to me (kinda, still haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t purchased it) but I would just consider whether or not eye creams are that important to you. My under eyes are so dry, especially when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m wearing makeup, and this one product really changed that for me. If that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a problem for you, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely cheaper options. The small one lasted me months too, so this will last you forever.\\r\\nA big thanks to Influenster for letting my try this eye cream.Ive actually never tried an eye cream before and now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten the opportunity to try it out.a little goes a long way and it so hydrating I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already recommended it to my friends to try it out\\xf0\\x9f\\xa5\\xb0(100% free thanks to influencer)\\xe2\\x98\\xba\\xef\\xb8\\x8f #free #SpringIntoSummerVoxBox\\r\\nIt smells so good. I applied this onto my eyes in the morning and it kept that area moisture throughout the whole day. #springintosummervoxbox\\r\\nI loved this lightweight eye cream, which definitely delivers a difference in the feeling and appearance of my under eye area! I always feel like eye creams are just expensive small containers of face moisturizer, but this cream made a noticeable difference in under eye hydration as well as improving fine lines. I love the belif brand, they have a forever customer in me!\\r\\nLove the long lasting moisturizing results with the product without the greasiness. This is the perfect complement to the belif true cream moisturizing bomb (which I also love) for the face. This product has the same fresh scent that leaves you refreshed after you put it on.  This product was received complimentary for testing purposes.\\r\\nI really loved this product! Super lightweight but moisturizing on my eyes, great for morning and night. Never made my eyes puffy from over moisturizing the undereye. It is expensive so I have not repurchased as my holy grail is the CeraVe eye cream which is much cheaper.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI absolutely loooove this. My under eye area has been especially dry and tight feeling for quite some time now and after using this every day for the last couple of weeks has really helped my skin feel less tight, feels super soft and supple, and looks brighter to me. I would 10/10 recommend this to anyone wanting to try a new eye cream. Just the teensiest dab will do ya. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8e\\r\\nLove this! My eyes look so much better if I stay consistent with this. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mix well with my make up so I usually use it when I just wear light makeup/ BB cream or at night. Love!\\r\\nVery gentle and soft around my eyes. It does not irritate it or get into my eye. I find my eyes to be super tight when I wake up the next morning! Also super adorable packaging with the blue color!\\r\\nI love it! This is light and hydrating, a joy to use! The packaging is fine, but the star here is such a great product at a relatively reasonable price point. Great for dry skin under eyes.\\r\\nThis is a super refreshing eye bomb but I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any sort of difference after using it for weeks.\\r\\nMy go to eye (gel) cream! Excellent!!!! So light and fresh and clean feeling.  And it feels weightless.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s excellent at moisturizing .... but sadly it will not reverse the aging process lol\\r\\nVery moisturizing but no other benefits that I saw. Didn\\'t see any improvements on my dark circles. I don\\'t really have puffiness so can\\'t comment on that. \\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hydrating, and does reduce the fine lines under the eye. But didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really do anything for my dark circles.\\r\\nBelif moisturizing eye bomb is the best eye cream i have ever used, it hydrates skin under eye well, is really good for dark circles and small winkles, Belif is my favorite brand for last period, highly recommended\\r\\nI got a small sample in my subscription to Luxebox. This is one of the worst eye creams I ever used. It was not moisturizing at all. It takes forever to sink in and pills underneath my makeup. Furthermore, it made my undereyes look dry and emphasized my lines whenever I wore concealer on top.\\r\\nI have purchased this eye cream 5 times. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so moisturizing and has helped to reduce my wrinkles. Will be repurchasing it for myselfa d as gifts for friends.belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis moisturizer really surprised me. It feels so light yet it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating. I was having really dry skin around my eyes due to allergies, so dry that it hurt... got this cream and wow! It took care of my eyes like no other. I love it and would totally recommend.\\r\\nEye Cream - Belif is undoubtedly a favorite I\\'ve talked about in every post. (No, Belif doesn\\'t really spend money on advertising and you share all your products with your own experience.) This is the morning routine I use...it\\'s great....\\r\\nI love how refreshing this product feels on my eyes. I use this product day and night.\\r\\nGreat eye cream. Very hydrating and soothing for my eyes. No color and fragrance. Did not break me out or cause bumps under my eyes. I like to use this once in the morning and once in the evening. Would recommend.\\r\\nI received this product in an Ipsy package, at first I didn\\'t see much of a difference, but after a few days I really like it. It makes my eyes look very bright and it also makes them very smooth. I normally use first thing in the morning. Love this product and will be buying way more. 10/10. \\r\\nOkay, I know I  rave about many things. But this under eye cream has been sent from heaven. The results are immediate at restoring tired looking eyes and dark circles. Also it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used many. Not even ROC is as good as this. The cream absorbs immediately and it lasts all day. Unlike other creams that tend to fade. The results last a full 12 hour day.\\r\\nLove the formula left my skin smooth and moisturized got to try this in my Ipsy glam bag totoally will be buying the larger size\\r\\nVery moisturizing but unsure if its doing anything for puffiness. I have genetic dark circles, as well as allergies that make it impossible for dark circles to disappear. Would reccommend but usually need another product to reduce puffiness\\r\\nI enjoy the cooling sensation upon initial application and I really love the fresh smell that Belif products have. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really see much result though.\\r\\nI really, really wanted to like this one but it just did not work for me. It was so sticky that it was not really doing anything. They need to work on that stickiness. I loved the way the packing looked. I would not buy again until it\\'s reformulated. #skincare\\r\\nThis is an amazing eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect for oily skin and combination skin. The water cream doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave your skin oily. It takes away the puffiness in your eyes.\\r\\nI love belif products in general because they are so thin in consistency yet apply well like a gel and deliver such a power punch of moisturizer that works well with my combination skin. I bought this moisturizing eye bomb after I had been using their facial moisturizer which is also so light weight and airy. I bought this with the sole intent of its burst of hydration hoping to prevent further crows feet and undereye lines. I am able to apply both morning and night and then use my SPF in the areas around it before continuing w my regular skincare regimen. I do you think that this has helped prevent further deepening of my crows feet and moistened my drier undereye skin\\xef\\xbf\\xbc.\\r\\nThis eye cream is the eye moisturizing\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa3! It is very lightweight, goes on silky smooth and gives your eye area a burst of moisture. And also allows for a flawless makeup application! I would definitely recommend to others!\\r\\nNeeded some serious help for my dry under eyes this winter, so I got myself a sample of this from Sephora and I\\'m so glad I did! Has the same smell as a lot of the other Belif products, but really helps hydrate under my eyes and keeps me looking fresh and awake.\\r\\nThis eye bomb is the best eye cream ever! This is especially good if you put it I. The fridge overnight then use it in the morning! I definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for an eye cream that wakes you up!\\r\\nA must-have eye cream in my life! If you ever have dry under eyes and nothing is working, give this one a try! It\\'s been a true life saver! A couple years ago I had severe dry under eyes and nothing would work. My under eyes were flaky af and I do live in the east coast. I tried everything from Drunk Elephant to your drug store products and then a friend of mine recommended this product and I haven\\'t looked back since. I do switch up my eye creams just to see if anything else works better but I always come back to this one. It is a little pricey at $48 but it lasts me a long time because you don\\'t need a lot of product to get the results!\\r\\nSo far there hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been a product of beliefs that I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t loved.  This eye \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbomb\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a gel consistency, and it sinks in so nicely while hydrating your skin.  I have dry eye area and this does wonders for me.  Gel consistency is really nice compared to some heavy cream.\\r\\nI initially didn\\'t really try this product.  I used it a few times inconsistently.  But I incorporated it into my morning and night routine.  I noticed that my eyes were very moisturized.  The fine lines were fading.  I see my dark circles are not as dark . It is a smooth balm, it absorbs well and doesn\\'t sting.  I only with our was cheaper! I have the sample size and now I need more! \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\xad\\r\\nI really like Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s light yet moisturizing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not greasy and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t smudge your eye make up.\\r\\nBelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is exactly what it says it is. Super moisturizing! My eyes are very dry and this gel feels so nice under them. I put some on my eyelids also to hydrate them before makeup. I would definitely buy it again. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect for my skin type. I recommend it!\\r\\nSo moisturizing and smooth, a little goes a very long way. No artificial smell, the only thing I would want out of this is for it to be a brightening eye cream. But other than that I would totally recommend to anyone suffering with dry under-eyes or eyelids!\\r\\nBest eye mask I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used ! so cooling and moistened feels the best ! I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe how quickly my eyes were not dry anymore\\r\\nVery very very moisturizing eye cream! I received this on a subscription box and liked it!\\r\\nVery thick for a gel cream. Irritated my eyes because it tended to spread easily due to its texture.\\r\\nI got this in a sample size to try before committing and now I will definitely buy a full size of this. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never been an eye cream gal just because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m only 23 & I never saw the use....but this has changed my mind. It leaves my under eyes moisturized and my dark circles have dramatically changed.\\r\\nNow don\\'t get me wrong this is pretty moisturizing.  It takes a while to dry down, it\\'s fragranced (why do my eyes have to smell good?) and I now have a milia spot that won\\'t go away. Personally I prefer the eye cream in the white jar by Belif if I had to choose one.\\r\\nI had a sample  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb of this from Sephora and I loved it. But I cant really give a huge review because I only used it for 2 weeks, but it worked and I could definitely see a change in my undereye area.\\r\\nWhile the texture of this product was nice, it was so fragrant that it made my eyes water. Not sure how the description can say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s made without fragrance while \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfragrance of natural origins\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is also listed in the ingredients, including orange oil, which can be very sensitive to skin. Will not purchase again.\\r\\nReceived this as a free sample at Sephora and after only a few uses I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen such a difference in firmness. The moisture aspect is amazing as well. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in love. Sits well under my concealer too, consistency is dreamy. Will buy full size once I run out!!\\r\\nI received a deluxe size sample of this eye cream from Ipsy and was instantly hooked! It smells so light and refreshing, which I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve come to expect from Korean Beauty products. It lives up to it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoisturizing eye bomb\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as it left the skin around my eyes intensely hydrated, but not greasy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gentle, which is very important to me with all skincare, especially anything going near my eyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quite pricey, but worth every penny. Also, a little goes a long way, so you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to repurchase as often as you might think. Definitely recommend; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gold! A+ product!!\\r\\nThis has that nice clean smell that a lot of belief products have and I love it for that, but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much for my dark circles(though it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really claim too). May be better for other eye concerns.\\r\\nPuffy eyes be gone!  Fine lines bye bye!  This eye cream is amazing.  No one will ever know you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sleep a wink last night.  Feels amazing going on and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really impressed by  its efficacy.\\r\\nI like the texture and the amount of moisture I feel it brings to my under eyes. Besides the price point, I would buy this more often\\r\\nReally like eye non. I have puffy eyes.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s light. Not greasy.  And great for my dry skin follow up with moisturizer\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve received this in a sample size from Sephora and enjoyed using it. I would purchase the full size.\\r\\nI really like this moisturizer. Under my eyes are constantly dry and this provides so much hydration. I use it right before bed. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too thick and it absorbs pretty quickly. I also sometimes use a small amount under my concealer and it does a great job.\\r\\nLove this stuff. It feels so nice on your skin. Originally I was drawn to the pretty packaging, but have now found myself loving all the BELIEF products that I come across. Another bonus is the price point. Most \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeneficial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d eye creams/bombs are pretty pricey for a small amount of product. With Belief you get a large amount, that will last a while, for the same price or less!\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It is very moisturizing and melts into your skin. I love using this under concealer. I also love applying a thicker layer before bed. If you need a moisturizing eye cream, look no further.\\r\\nIt works pretty well but I noticed that my eyes get puffy when I put this on at night before I go to bed (not sure why). So I only use this in the AM before makeup and seems work well.\\r\\nA little goes a long way with this eye cream. It\\'s light and refreshing. I didn\\'t like that it made my under eye concealer crease and come off though so I can only use it at night.\\r\\nI got this as a sample and I wasnt that impressed love the scent but I didnt feel it gave was all that moisturizing the consistency was nice its kinda like a gel and cream mixed if that makes sence\\r\\nAlso got this is as a sample, but through Ipsy! Has the same gel formula, which is perfect for that delicate skin underneath the eyes. Have been using the sample for about 2 weeks at night and have barely made a dent, so it\\'s safe to say a little goes a very long way.\\r\\nI wanted to like this. :( I love other belif products but this one was a flop for me. It is moisturizing and feels good on my eyes but does not help in any way. I mostly just use it now whenever I feel like my eyes need a pick me up.\\r\\nI really enjoyed this eye cream!!! I snagged some sample sizes from ipsy.  It was super hydrating.  My eyes felt incredibly soft.  It helped keep fine lines and wrinkles b from forming.  It didn\\'t help with my dark circles though.  I\\'ve got very dark under eyes so I\\'m not repurchaseing a full size.\\r\\nBuyer beware! You may develop allergies to this product. I do not typically have sensitive skin. I used this eye bomb for a few weeks with no ill (and no noticeably positive beyond moisturizing) effects. However, this morning I woke up with both eyes swollen nearly shut after applying it last night. After taking allergy meds, things are slowly improving, but both eyelids (and under-eye areas) are still swollen, red, itchy, and sore.\\r\\nMy favorite under eye cream. It\\'s hydrating and feels good. This will hydrate the heck out of my dry under eyes. It absorbs quickly so you can wear it under makeup. It lasts a long time too as you only need a little bit.\\r\\nIt\\'s one of the amazing hydrating gels ever it contain ns hydraulic acid which is the best for you skin for hydration it\\'s the best to use using this is a bit pricey but gonna buy second coz it\\'s lightweight formula perfect for oily skin and combination as well dry skin people can also use\\r\\nNot really sure that this has really done anything for me. I think it has given milia so unfortunately I won\\'t be repurchasing.\\r\\nI received a sample size of [product:belif-moisturizing-eye-bomb] in my Ipsy bag, and I have to say I love it.\\xef\\xbf\\xbc I wear contacts daily and as a result, the skin around my eyes is sensitive and tired. This moisturizer felt cool and soothing.  I imagine it would feel even better applied cold. I have tried a lot of eye creams and been disappointed. This is one I will definitely purchase and continue using.\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nThis eye cream is great for sensitive skin.  As it gets colder and drier in NYC, I rely on this product to keep my eye area moisturized and soft.\\r\\nThis eye cream is okay. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really moisturizing but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change anything visibly. I got it as a sample and I used it up but I definitely wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t purchase this for the price that it is.\\r\\nMy favorite eye cream. I use this at night and my Banana Bright Eye Cr\\xc3\\xa8me in the morning. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really feel the need for a brightening effect at night so I focus on hydration which this product gives me tons of. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so silky and glides on beautifully. What fine lines? Dark circles where?\\r\\nVery thick product so I recommend using it as your nighttime eye cream. Overall very pleased with the product. I used it before bed and the next morning (I usually don\\'t wear other products so if I apply it early enough in my routine it will have absorbed into my skin mostly before leaving). \\r\\nLove this eye cream is super smooth and works great. Packaging is cute. I really recommend this and will buy again.\\r\\nI liked this product, for its freshness, its appearance of whipped cream and lemon, very light and easy to apply. It is quickly absorbed by the delicate skin. Instantly refreshes and keeps moisturizing the pockets and fine lines for a long time. Soften and smooth fine lines. I have very sensitive eyes in general, so I use his products with apprehension. I have not reacted. To be used regularly before putting on makeup or in the evening before bedtime, no problem! I had a sample bought with the luxebox if topbox, but it\\'s probably a Product that I Will renew!\\r\\nTotally reduced the spots under my eyes ANDDDDD minimized my pores! Very light weight and absorbs quickly.\\r\\nJust buy the moisturizing bomb and apply it underneath your eyes. It is more moisturizing, has alcohol further down on the ingredient list, and is cheaper when you look at price per an ounce. You can thank me later.\\xc2\\xa0 \\r\\nThis eye bomb is amazing!! Has a thin gel like texture that melts into the under eye area with a cooling effect. Definitely helps reduce puffiness in the under eye area;) definitely recommend this product!!\\r\\nI am 35 now and just recently started noticing in photos that I am seeing a few fine lines and wrinkles so I was excited to receive a mini travel size of this. I just started using it this week but so far it\\'s really nice. Has a really nice texture that absorbs nicely into your skin, not greasy or anything and a tiny little dab is all you need so it\\'s going to go a long ways. I\\'m loving it so far.  Update October 29-19: I\\'ve recently been dealing with an issue of a contact dermatitis (allergic reaction) to a chemical that I somehow spread from my body to my face and it showed up in the form of really bad eczema around my eyes, mainly my right eye. I havnt been able to put anything on my face for several weeks now because of it. Except for coconut oil this past week and now this stuff over the past 2 or 3 days. It is now about 60 to 65% better and seems to be improving a little bit each day. I am pretty sure this stuff is helping to heal it so I am going to continue using it.\\r\\nI purchased this 5ml from a lady to try it out I bought two of them immediately I saw results under my eyes were moisturized and not as sunken in No allergic reactions I am a true believer in this eye product price is on the money it is definitely a great new product worth the try\\r\\nLove this product!!! Cooling effect,  reduced puffiness and circles for a day. Nice scent(natural), maybe some essential oils present?. Belif is super natural and I \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d that.  I love all Korean Beauty products and this does not disappoint-I will purchase in the future!!!\\r\\nSuper hydrating and non- irritating. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice if it helped with wrinkles, but my eyes were definitely less dry and the skin felt more elastic.\\r\\nbelif moisturizing eye bomb  is very light, but incredibly moisturizer. I had it in sample size.  My eyes was bright, moist, relaxed. love the smell also, very refreshing !! \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x99\\r\\nThis smart little tub was in my Ipsy bag last month. Finally!\\xc2\\xa0 An product that truly nourishes the skin under my eyes. My eyes literally sucked up the product leaving no residue or tacliness a minute or two later. I really like the scant smell of lavender. I did not have any type of allergic reaction nor did this eye balm create problems with my concealer/foundation. I am so pleasantly surprised with this product. The search is over.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nMy all time FAVORITE eye cream. It is a little more costly than something found at a local drugstore but well worth it. My biggest issue is it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not accessible near me. I have to order online or drive an hour south to get it. I just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always do that and have had to try others. None compare to this so far. \\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\r\\nAlso received this in an Ipsy bag! Sample was super small but has lasted! Really enjoy this eye cream\\r\\nThis product does exactly what it says it does, moisturize! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hydrating and you can feel like right away! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not great for under eye bags/ dark circles. The price is very reasonable for the amount of product you get, esp compared to other brands!\\r\\nVery moisturizing. Light and thin but powerful. Nice scent. Like to store in fridge.\\r\\nI\\'ve tried other eye creams that worked okay but left room for improvement. I absolutely love this eye balm! Not only does it hydrate well it also reduces fine lines as well as crepe! It has a light pleasant scent that isn\\'t too overpowering. This cream is my new go to eye cream! I highly recommend it for more mature skin. I also suffer from dry skin and eczema and I\\'ve had no problems whatsoever with allergies!\\r\\nThis stuff is absolutely amazing. I love how a little goes a long way, and that it has a good amount of the product though. I\\'m not entirely positive about the price though. It is a bit of a huge splurge for me. It depends on how long it lasts and if I continue to see results throughout all the seasons. That being said, for now, I\\'m in love with it. Maybe I\\'ll come back in the future and update my review. P.S. I have dark circles genetically. I always look tired, even after I get a great night\\'s of rest. But giving it the moisture it needs helps with de-puffing it and it doesn\\'t burn my eyes. Not that I put it close to my eyeball, but I have really sensitive skin where as a lot of eye creams tend to burn my eyes. This stuff has been nice so far. Refreshing.\\r\\nOkay this stuff is good. Now, I didnt notice any great improvement of my under eye circles or the wrinkles around my eyes. But it does moisturize beautifully! I can also say that I had no issues when wearing it underneath my makeup, no greasiness or excess oils.\\r\\nI haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been using this long but I love the formula of this product. It makes my eyes feel so moisturized and healthy looking.\\r\\nThis under eye cream is very moisturizing. It doesn\\'t help much with dark circles or puffiness but it will keep the delicate skin under your eyes very moisturized and refreshed.\\r\\nMy holy grail eye cream! I have sensitive skin with an even more sensitive under eye area so a lot of eye creams are too harsh or scented for my under eyes. This eye cream however is delicate while being intensely moisturizing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wears great under makeup as well!\\r\\nI rarely give an eye cream five stars, so this might be my new Holy Grail! I got a small tub of this in my August 2019 Ipsy bag. I apply it at night and it hydrates so well I don\\'t NEED any the next morning. I also used it all over my face one night when I felt dehydrated and thought my skin was looking a little rough. Although my face didn\\'t wake up looking like my eyes do, I still got a really nice, ungreasy moisture. This is definitely worth it for all skin types!!\\r\\nThis eye cream is everything. I\\'ve never had such a light weight water cream feel so amazingly hydrating. As soon as you put it on your eyes feel sooo good, like your skin just drank an ice cold glass of water. It\\'s a very refreshing feeling. I like this cream for both day and night. Also it does keep your eye area hydrated for 26 hours, i love the fact that even though it lasts so long it never feels oily or greasy. Great product. A little goes a VERY long way so use sparingly.\\r\\nI just started using this 2 weeks ago. It kinda smells like there some type of menthol. Is very hydrating and you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need much at all.\\r\\nI received this in my Ipsy bag this month and I will definitely be buying the full-size product as I am almost finished this one!  I use it every morning in my skincare routine before applying my makeup for the day.  It really delivers a ton of hydration to my under eye area and as a result, I find my concealer to go on a lot nicer and it seems to work better.   Without makeup on, I have noticed a difference in the look of fine lines and texture in my undereye area. I am very pleased with this cream.  It does have a scent (I like the fresh scent) so be aware of that....although the scent does not linger at all and did not affect my super sensitive eyes.\\r\\nI have been using this product for the past few months and am not disappointed at all. It is a lightweight gel with a super smooth application. It definitely hydrates like no other and makes my eye area look like I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had a sufficient amount of sleep when I am truly running on less than six. With other eye creams, I would only apply them at night because they were too heavy or thick to wear during the day. I am glad that I found this product because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve actually switched my routine, so that I apply this in the morning and it works beautifully with my skin care and make up routine. A little bit of product goes along way, it lasts a good amount of time.\\r\\nI got a sample of this in my Ipsy bag and it is an amazing eye cream! I am just starting to add eye creams to my daily routine and I absolutely love this one! Even though I got a small size it will last me forever because you only need a very small amount. It is a really good eye cream and I definitely recommend!\\r\\nI love this stuff! Plain and simple. I like this eye cream a lot because the product doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel weird after awhile under the eye.\\r\\nWhile I can not vouch for the long term affects, when I use this consistently I see a serious difference in the lines under my eyes. Eye creams that actually show results are hard to come by, and this eye cream is the best I have ever tried. Very hydrating and soft on sensitive skin\\r\\nI have been wanting to try this eye cream for so long, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad I finally got the opportunity! It has a nice consistency\\xe2\\x80\\x94not too thick, but you can tell it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s there. I use it exclusively at night. Honestly, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if it is doing anything for my skin that my current moisturizer wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t already. I might not have dry enough under eyes to notice a huge difference, it is soothing, smells clean, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy to have it!\\r\\nThis product definitely gets the job done, I got a sample size in my ipsy bag an just had to get the full size! Super hydrating. Most definitely over exceeded my expectations\\r\\nLove this eye cream! So hydrating. Feels like velvet on; the texture is amazing. Absorbs quickly and does not feel sticky at all. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve have a few mini samples of this and it has lasted such a long time; a little goes a long way. Will absolutely purchase a full size container next.\\r\\nLove this eye cream, absorbs nice and keeps delicate under eye area moisturized nicely.\\r\\nI received a sample of this in my ipsy bag this month, I really enjoy it so far! It has a light and delicate smell and the texture is nice and buttery. So far I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m loving it!\\r\\nThis is an amazing eye cream. I love Belif and the moisturizing eye cream is amazing! The texture is lightweight yet thick. it has scent but does not irate my eye area at all. Just leave my eye area moisture and after about 14 days I could see the fine lines soften and after a month the lines were gone!\\r\\nThis is my go to eye cream! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it for some time now and I love it! It feels amazing after I apply because it leaves a cooling effect. I also noticed my dark circles getting lighter within 2/3 weeks after adding it into my daily skincare routine! I highly recommend this eye cream!\\r\\nThis is my current every-day eye cream! \\xc2\\xa0It\\'s very hydrating, but its gel-like consistency doesn\\'t make it feel heavy at all. \\xc2\\xa0It depuffs my eyebags and doesn\\'t have a fragrance scent (which is great for sensitive eyes). \\xc2\\xa0It doesn\\'t do much with brightening, but brightening was not one of its marketed benefits, so I don\\'t hold it against the product. \\xc2\\xa0Overall, it\\'s a great eye cream that hydrates and moisturizes. \\xc2\\xa0I\\'m currently half-way through my 1st jar, and I\\'ll repurchase once I finish this one!\\r\\nAbsolutely love this moisturizing eye bomb. It made some difference under my eyes like for real. Hop on this y\\xe2\\x80\\x99all, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best out there! Been using this for quite some time now and it is Henny Approved \\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\r\\nI liked it not love it. I bought a mini set from belif. It felt okay on the skin but the products was so small that i couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had a good amount of time to see the difference from other eye cream\\r\\nIf you need an intensely hydrating eye cream this is for you. The hydrating creme contains tiger grass to soothe the skin and comfrey leaf to smooth. This eye cream is best suited for those with dry or dehydrated skin around the eye area. For those with oilier skin, this eye cream might slide or melt off the face.\\r\\nI loved this eye cream. My skin is very dry in certain spots and this was very hydrating under my eyes. The scent was light. I can definitely see myself using this for a long time and will repurchase when I run out.\\r\\nThis stuff is magic.  It smooths and brightens.   I have no puff with thos stuff.  Dark circles are gone, too.\\r\\nThere are a billion eye products out there.  I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell that this one is any better than the others, but I like it\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your average eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very very moisturizing. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember noticing a scent which is nice. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of pricey and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember ever seeing this anywhere other than Sephora so that sucks.\\r\\nThis is the best eye cream ever. It is so moisturizing. It soaks right in and you can even wear it under makeup. This is my holy grail!\\r\\nI liked this eye cream for the moisture it sealed in and the way it provided a barrier for the delicate skin around my eyes. It was a nice product that slightly lightened my dark circles. I only wish it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ball up when going over it a few minutes later. It could have sunk into my skin better.\\r\\nThis is a great eye cream! Very cooling under the eyes. I apply this at night and it works amazing! Definitely worth the money. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very gentle under the eyes! Recommend to anyone looking for an eye cream!\\r\\nAfter my first use, I thought this eye cream was too thick and rich. I was super paranoid about getting milia, so I wanted to stay away from anything that was too emollient for my eyes. However, after a few more uses (only at night), I am totally in love with this product. Even though it felt super rich in the beginning, it gets absorbed very quickly, leaving the area around my eyes soft and supple. I also like to mix a tiny bit of it with my concealer and it just smooths out my concealer perfectly. It adds moisture, feels refreshing, and I definitely recommend it.\\r\\nThis eye creme does nothing but moisturize. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s neither good or bad. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whatever. Would not purchase as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m more focused on anti aging\\r\\nThis eye cream feels AHHMAZING!!! Its cool, clean, and very moisturizing. I love this brand, especially in the summertime, but their eye cream I would use year round. With all the hydraunic (sp) acid, it plumps up the skin around my eyes, especially the fine lines and is very soothing.\\r\\nWow this eye cream is absolutely amazing!!!! My under eyes are particularly dry and concealer always ends up looking cakey and creasy after a couple hours. Not with this!!! My under eyes are so smooth and hydrated. A little bit goes a VERY LONG WAY. This is a pretty big tub for only $48 and absolutely worth it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using it morning and night for about a week and barely put a dent in it.\\r\\nOh my goodness!!!!! I wish I could give this product ten stars !!!!! It is the best most hydrating eye cream I have ever used and I spend hundreds of dollars on skincare monthly to try to find the perfect products. After finding this I have not tried anything else for eye creams cause this is the ultimate I have ever used. My favorite. I get really dry skin around my eyes so this is perfect for the hydration of my eyes!!!!! Highly highly highly recommend\\r\\nRecently I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been getting skin peeling under my eyes and this really helps. Not only does it moisturise it also brightens and I instantly look more awake after I use it. It is quite expensive but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the only eye cream that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been working for me long term recently. I previously reviewed the Simple\\xc2\\xae Soothing Eye Balm which was good but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even compare to this one. #essential\\r\\nLots of moisture and no irritation on my sensitive skin. I only use it at night as it takes a while to soak in and will crease under concealer.\\r\\nThis a hydrating lightweight eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very gentle. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mainly hydrating. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help with dark circles or wrinkles. If that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you need I would suggest looking somewhere else.\\r\\nThis product does, as it claims, hydrate your under eyes. It does not have anti-aging properties, it does not plump up the wrinkles. I do like this for those days I know I need extra coverage for those pesky dark circles that are darker on those sleepless nights. This helps make the full coverage concealers not cake or crease as usual. \\r\\nVery good moisturizer for under eyes . I need to try the moisturizer and firming one since I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m getting old and need all the extra help I can get. But if you just in need for dry under eyes this is a good one and a jar will last you forever\\r\\nThis works for about 2 hours then it wears off. I do like it, but can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t keep putting it on every 2 hours! I f you need a quick fix this is the product to use!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nFor someone with dry under-eyes like me, this eye cream unfortunately did not work for me. It\\'s a great product underneath concealer but to use this as a treatment.. I\\'ll pass. I ended up returning this eye-cream because it was not hydrating enough for me.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nLove love love this eye cream extremely moisturizing and hydrating. Easy gel-like texture sinks and quickly. works really really well in dry climates which is hard to find\\r\\nThis is your basic hydrating eye cream. It does the job of delivering moisture to the eye area, and it did not irritate my eyes at all. I am in my mid-20\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and do not have wrinkles around the eye area yet, so this eye cream is perfect for me as a preventative measure by keeping the skin moisturized. I also love that all the Belif products are quite affordable for their premium products, and this eye cream jar is pretty large for the price you pay (compared to other eye creams out there).\\r\\nReally hydrating. I really like the lemongrass scent it has and I bought this product in mini size with a kit.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb  I myself haven\\'t got problems with my under eye area, but I like to keep is moisturized every night... With this cream my under eyes were still wet from the previous application.\\r\\nso insanely hydrating and I love it. I have super dry undereyes & this has helped them so much. I love how it feels and my undereyes always feel so much better with it on. leaves a little bit of a sticky residue for a while if you do it in the am but honestly worth it.\\r\\nI love this product! This is very lightweight, refreshing eye cream floods fine lines. makes skin perfect for flawless makeup application. This cooling texture instantly bursts with hydration and blends seamlessly, keeping the eye area supple and hydrated while prepping it for a smooth crease-free makeup application.\\r\\nBy now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve probably used at least 5 deluxe samples of this and several foil samples. Any chance I get to redeem my Sephora points to get this, I do it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve bought a belif set that came with a water gel, two moisturizers and this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best! My favorite! I will definitely buy a full size in the future, I just really need to use up all my other eye creams to justify a purchase, story of my life ha!\\r\\nMy under eye concerns are almost unsolvable, I have very dark circles that are thankfully not puffy. So this product unfortunately hasn\\'t helped my under eyes brighten in any way but instead has kept the area very moisturized and healthy which I appreciate.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nGod I love this eye cream! It goes on so easily and soaks in well. Very gentle around the eyes and is even great for forehead lines! Yes! I use this on my forehead and between the brow instead of my regular moisturizer because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pill! I like to apply it under my Belif water sleeping mask!\\r\\nAbsolutely amazing! It gives my eyes a burst of hydration in the morning and keeps me looking great all day.\\r\\nAmazing for those who want some deep hydration to the eye area. Interesting fact- the eye area is the most delicate area on the face and has the hardest time retaining hydration! With continual use, this product will be sure to make a change in your skin care routine.\\r\\nI got this as a sample from influensters for free and enjoyed enjoyed this guy. The cream wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really thick, but the right water to cream ratio. It spreader against the skin very easy and leave it smooth. It definitely brightened up under the eye a bit as well.\\r\\nIt\\'s really nice and feels great but haven\\'t noticed much of a difference and it feels that sometimes it is a little thick for under the eyes.\\r\\nThis is a very creamy eye moisturizer. Though I normally like the gel type formulas, this one packed a moisture punch that won me over.  It leaves my skin smooth and with visible less fine lines. And in the winter it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my go to for dryness that I deal with in the harsh wind.  It absorbs quickly and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave a heavy residue feeling which I love!\\r\\nMeilleur cr\\xc3\\xa8me contour des yeux sur le march\\xc3\\xa9, hydrate en profondeur. Mais n\\xe2\\x80\\x99agit pas sur les cernes.\\r\\nLove it. Got a full size to review and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still using it. It smells good, and last longer because of the amount for the price.\\r\\nThe Belif Eye Bomb is a decent eye cream. It\\'s nothing to write home about, but it\\'s not bad by any means. It\\'s just ok. Not something I would recommend or steer someone away from. Just right down the middle mediocre.\\r\\nThis is one of my current favorites. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deeply hydrating and makes my eyes feel fresh and ready for the day. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also thick enough wear at night but still layers well under makeup in the day.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI thought this product was okay. I wish it moisturized more. Although the product has a good price, I wish I would have tried something else. I feel like there are better products out there on the market. Hopefully they can come out with an advanced formula in the future.\\r\\nThe best eye cream. hands down.\\xc2\\xa0I have heard a lot of people complain about this stinging the eyes - you\\'re not supposed to put it in your eyes (just around, I promise you it won\\'t stay in one spot and your entire eye area will get the moisture it needs without you putting it IN your eye)\\r\\nA very good moisturizing formula. Is pretty thick for an eye cream but is easily absorbed, which i think is a very important feature for an eye cream. Leaves skin nicely moisturized and feeling soft. A little goes a veey long way. So even though it is a little pricey you will have ot for a long time.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI\\'ve been using this for a few weeks and it\\'s really not doing anything for the fine lines around my eyes. Disappointed.\\r\\nI am in love with this eye cream. I had tried other Belif products in the past, but wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t impressed. This one blew me away. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insanely hydrating which is a must on my dry under eyes. My concealer goes on so much better when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used this beforehand.\\r\\nI was so excited to try a belif product, and I wanted to love the Moisturizing Eye Bomb. The packaging was lovely, keeping with belif\\'s standards. The texture was also lovely and felt cooling on the eyes. I hate that this product stung my eyes.\\r\\nSeems to be hydrating but might not be enough every time I use this and put concealer on my concealer looks more dry. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if it just doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sit nice under makeup or my other eye cream is better.\\r\\nI honestly am super disappointed in this product. I have heard very good things about belif as a brand and was ecstatic to receive the voxbox for this. I have drier under eyes so I was hoping this would combat that. BUT it does NOTHING. I have tried this for a while and have seen zero results. It does not even seep into the skin a little. It sits on top of your skin and in the matter of minutes balls up and easily wipes away.\\r\\nThe belief Moisturizing Eye Bomb truly is the bomb! When my eye lids are feeling dry I reach for this because it hydrates them in seconds and smooths away lines and wrinkles. You will see results in just 7 days. it is gel consistency but sinks into the skin in seconds. I have this in the full size and travel size because I don\\'t want to be with out it especially right now in the winter.\\r\\nThis is a great eye cream to apply moisture to the under eyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a gel-consistency and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t act greasy under make-up! I have extremely dry under eyes and this just didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pack enough punch to be my stand-alone cream. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have anything negative to say, just wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the best!\\r\\nBest eye cream ever .  Seems like a small container but i have used the same small bottle for 6 months !  For the price and the fact that this stuff is just amazing , how could you not try it !\\r\\nThis is my discovery from Ipsy. This product became must have for mee. After using this eye cream diseepear my problem about under eye cyrcle and coloring. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good moisturizer,you feel good result soon after strart using.\\r\\nVery moisturizing, and cooling. Helps with wrinkles, and dryness. First time user. I actually got a sample of it. I believe it is a little pricey. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gentle. On the price yes, it could improve.\\r\\nI\\'m a true fan of Korean Beauty and have purchased other items from this brand. The cream is lightweight & can be used in the morning under make-up. It obsorbs quickly and doesn\\'t have a any fragrance that may irritate the eyes.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nExtremely moisturizing eye cream. It also smells lovely. My makeup does not melt off throughout the day when I use this in the morning. I got this as a sample and may have to purchase a full size. A little goes a long way.\\r\\nThis stuff truly makes my eyes look brighter and stiffer!! I use this every night before bed. It smells good, and really does work. It also lasts a very long time - a little goes a long way.  I am glad that I got to try this because I will never use another eye cream again.\\r\\nI swear by this! After using this my under eyes are so smooth and makeup goes on perfectly with no creasing. It really hydrates my under eyes and helps me look awake after late nights. I definitely recommend it!\\r\\nThis is is great rapid moisturizing for the eyes. No you dont see that much of a difference immediately but it really gives a good moisturization like nothing else.\\r\\nDidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see a huge improvement in dark circles or puffiness. Was very moisturizing. Was not harsh at all on my skin. \\xc2\\xa0First time user of this product. \\xc2\\xa0Not very effective.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hydrating and sits well under my makeup. For an eye cream at Sephora the price is definitely more reasonable.\\r\\nThis eye cream is so bomb! I use it day and night and it moisturizes better than any eye cream I\\'ve ever used. It\\'s super hydrating without being greasy. It absorbs quickly and doesn\\'t run off into the eyes. Works beautifully under makeup and it\\'s great for layering over serums. The tiniest bit goes a long way. I highly recommend this is you\\'ve been looking for a product that addresses dryness, tightness, cracking or early signs of aging around the eyes.\\r\\nVery watery. I used it everyday. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see much of a difference I was hoping that it would have a little bit of a creamier consistency\\r\\nLove this eye cream. Not very fragranced which is refreshing. Also a great value for the amount of product you get!!\\r\\nThis cream is absolutely amazing. I received it as 100 point park at Sephora. But, when I finish this I will definitely buy the full-size. It is very hydrating for your under eyes, which makes it great for any skin type and every age. I love how it hydrate your skin very quickly, and leaves no weird residue behind. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!\\r\\nThis really does moisturizer your eyes. It lasts all day, so your eyes don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel dry at all. It makes my concealer go on pretty well.\\r\\nThis is such a wonderful product. My undereyes throughout day get a really drying feeling especially in the winter this just gives me a nice pick me up and makes my undereyes feel so great. I recommend putting this in the refrigerator so when you apply it, the product has a cooling or cool sensation to it.\\r\\nThis is the best eye cream i have ever used. I have really sensitive skin and allergies to alot. This makes my under eye cosmetic products apply so much better. It doesn\\'t move into my eyes either like some eye products. Also a plus it doesn\\'t have a nasty smell.\\r\\nThis cream is like a thicker version of the True Cream Aqua Bomb, which is a really solid moisturizer. This version is nice, but unfortunately, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel like it does very much. It is light, absorbs well, and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave a residue, but the actives leave much to be desired. I prefer eye creams with hyaluronic acid or caffeine\\xe2\\x80\\x94things that make a visible difference. This will moisturize, but not much else.\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sleep a lot on account of I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a mom, wife, supervisor, sister, friend, women. So I like to take my eye bomb and pat that sucker under my eye and feel like I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a hot mess. It works. My eyes feel hydrated, cool and thanks to genetics and this cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a hot baggy eyed mess. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bit expensive but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot and lasts awhile so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth it.\\r\\nThis is one of my favorite eye products, so I keep it by my bedside at all times. I love how it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s light and airy, while delivering moisture and hydration for days. It has a nice cooling effect, and does not feel heavy like some eye creams do\\r\\nGreat product!! I have extremely dry skin so i need hydration big time under my eyes!! This eye bomb works wonders for me it\\'s extremely hydrating it sinks into the skin quickly and leaves your under eyes super soft!! Definitely recommend!!!\\r\\nThe best eye cream EVER!! I tried a looot of eyecreams from several brands & none of them really did something to my dry under eyes. Until a friend of mine suggested to try this belief one & okuurrr neber looked back! It has a really unique formulla that sincks into the sensitive eye area and leaves it fresh & hydrated &plump in love! Wil purshase it again for sure!\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xf0\\x9f\\x99\\x86\\r\\nI love this eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the only one I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve repurchased after running out of it as I normally like to try new products as often as possible. Very fast absorbed, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a scent or color, and I notice my under eye area very moisturized and plump. I do have dry skin so moistuziration is something I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m constantly seeking for. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d however, prefer if this was an air tight pump or a squeeze tube.\\r\\nBelif is one of my favorite brands. I received\\xc2\\xa0this in my sephora play box and was hooked. I use this every morning and every night. I have oily skin and this doesn\\'t make me to oily and is very moisturizing. A little goes a long way so it\\'s worth the price. I have repurchased this twice and don\\'t see me using anything else in the near future\\r\\nI love this eye cream at night. I like to keep it in the fridge so that it\\'s cool when I apply it. Helps plump up and moisturize overnight\\r\\nA small travel size product but you have to use it in such small amounts and it stays longer. I just dab a little near my eye. The puffiness and the dryness is surely reduced. It reduces wrinkles. Would definitely recommend.\\r\\nThis product, let me tell you is amazing!!! I absolutely love all of Belif\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products. I have sensitive skin, and their products work great and have never broken me out. I have fine lines under my eyes that get really dry at times. Once I started using this moisturizing eye bomb, the dryness started going away. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a staple in my daily skin care routine and HIGHLY RECOMMEND Belif\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products.\\r\\nInstantaneous hydration for the eye area .. this cream gives me super charm .. it is excellent for the eye area that is super senciblebelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nEye moisturizer prevents wrinkles and soft and very pleasant for the area under the eyes and opens the black area under the eyes\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x9c\\r\\nLove this stuff, super hydrating but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make your skin greasy! The product is thick and very gentle on the skin. One bottle of this stuff lasts forever!\\r\\nThis is one of my favorite eye moisturizers! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating and light in texture . I use it in the morning and night depending on my routine. I recommend this for anyone! It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make your skin oily either which is great\\r\\nMUST HAVE PRODUCT!!! Belif moisturizing eye bomb is one of my favorite eye products ever! The consistency is great and is very moisturizing. I use this product twice a day to make sure I reap all the benefits. The eye area is the first to age, so it is an area that needs extra care. It absorbs really well and smells amazing. My number ONE!!\\r\\nI love this eye bomb . When you apply this product it feels nice and cool. It keeps my under eye looking fresh and feeling moisturized.\\r\\nI love it!\\xc2\\xa0I have combination skin and this moisturizes my dry places without turning my oily places into an oily mess. Tried a sample size first, loved it so bought this larger size. A little goes a long way each night. Using around eyes & forehead wrinkles. Skin feels so hydrated but not oily!\\r\\nNice, light, hydrating eye moisturer. A little goes along way. I use this morning and night. The skin around my eyes always looks soft, not dry and crepey. I had no issues with wearing this under makeup either.\\r\\nI use this eye cream every single night. Ever since the first time I tried this I have been absolutely in love with it and how super moisturizing it is! It sinks into my skin so well but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave me feeling greasy afterwards.\\r\\nI absolutely love this company. I have sensitive skin, oily in the t-zones, have bags and dark circles under eyes. This product is light, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bother my eyes or skin. A lil pricey but worth it. This has definitely changed my skin care regime.\\r\\nI have combination skin and this moisturizes my dry places without turning my oily places into an oily mess. Tried a sample size first, loved it so bought this larger size. A little goes a long way each night. Using around eyes & forehead wrinkles. Skin feels so hydrated but not oily!\\r\\nI absolutely love this product. I use it every night as well as a moisturizer during the day. It keeps my under eye area hydrated. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very light and refreshing. It works very well with makeup and it just relaxes my skin during the night.\\r\\nIf u have problems with dry under eyes and with ur concealer creasing on u try this under eye cream it works wonders go get a sample and give it a go, u won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t regret it\\r\\nBelif moisturizing eye bomb is the bomb!!!! I got this in one of my Sephora Play bags. I love it & use it about every night on my eyes. I do see a big difference in the skin around my eyes. I notice when I do my eye makeup. It\\'s easier to apply on my lids. I\\'m 51 yrs old now, my skin is just starting to getting looser on my eyes and I have a little bit of wrinkles at the corners . so I want to stay ahead of it.\\r\\nI got a sample size of this eye cream in an Ipsy bag and I immediately fell in love. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve reached that age wear I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m starting to get fine lines under my eyes and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen a considerable improvement in them since I started using this.\\r\\nAmazing eye cream perfect to wear under your concealer! After I run off my sample (courtesy of influenster) I bought it online, I carry it with me all the time and reapply it during the day to refresh my makeup!\\r\\nI did not like this product at all. I got for free in a Sephora Playbox so I wanted to try it. The first day I tried it it left little whiteheads all under my eye where I had applied it. I threw out the product that same day.\\r\\nLove this eye balm, lightweight and creamy, it feels amazing around the eyes. I wish it had more anti aging components to it though\\r\\nThe smell is a little too perfumey for me but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a wonderful eye cream. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve wanted to try Belif products for a while and while I was a little disappointed with some, this one was pretty great. I probably will not purchase again but I will definitely wait to buy another eye cream until I use this one all up!\\r\\nVery hydrating and absorbs quickly! The size is very generous. Belief products are always high quality.\\r\\nI got a sample of this and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve fallen in love! It has hydrated my under eyes more than any other under eye moisturizer ever has! After just a week of using this, I have noticed a huge difference in my under eyes! I use it morning and night. In the morning I do put this on, let it set for a few minutes and then add my Olehendricksen banana eye cream on top and the bags almost disappear! Once the sample runs out I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be running to Sephora to grab the full size!\\r\\nI received a sample of this in the Aqualand Playset and I absolutely loved it! It delivered on all of its claims and I loved it as much as I love the Moisturizing Bomb. I wish it came in a pump packaging so that the ingredients remained stable for longer, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an effective eye cream worth the money regardless!\\r\\nI have been using this for about a month now and I can really tell a difference. This keeps my eye area very hydrated. I also notice that my eyes aren\\'t as puffy as they normally are not do I have dark circles anymore. This just makes my eyes look a thousand times better. Yes it\\'s on the pricier side, but it\\'s totally worth it!\\r\\nI love this product. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my favorite eye cream. It really moisturizes the skin around my eyes and makes my fine lines look better. I would definitely recommend\\r\\nKeeps skin nice and hydrated. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any fine lines around my eyes anymore. Moisture is key to prevent dry/wrinkle skin\\r\\nReceived it from the Sephora beauty box I believe and had no expectations but it feels refreshing,\\xc2\\xa0 doesn\\'t sting,\\xc2\\xa0 and I would say around my eyes look bright and tight. Not sunken,\\xc2\\xa0 no dark circles.\\xc2\\xa0 I don\\'t know how much it costs but if I find it affordable,\\xc2\\xa0 I would definitely buy again.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI got a sample of this and fell in love.  The only thing that I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like about it is the price tag.  It is very hydrating.  If it goes on sale I would purchase it.\\r\\nThis eye cream is highly moisturizing and creamy. It replenishes my under eye area, leaving it feeling new and younger ( I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m 24, but prevention is key!). I bought mine from Sephora, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure you can find it elsewhere. I recommend it!\\r\\nMy boyfriend and I love this product It is awesome. The price is a little bit expensive but it is worth it.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI received this as a sample size in my Ipsy bag and I have to say I love it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightweight and moisturizing and leaves the eyes feeling refreshed and awake. I would purchase on my own money when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m done with the sample size. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis was okay it does what it claims. It hydrates my eye area but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it. I need more from an eye moisturizer, more benefits then just hydration. If that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all your looking for in an eye cream (gel) you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll love it.\\r\\nI love this product! I have a small sample pot, from etsy, and I use it religiously now. It looks like a small product that\\'s not worth it, but the smallest little dab can be used on both of my eyes, so it really does last awhile. It feels really soothing to put on, and I can immediately feel how hydrating it is on my sore and puffy eyes after a long day. Highly recommend!\\r\\nWhile I usually sing the praises of this brand, this kinda just works. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice and light, works well under makeup and is somewhat hydrating. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not outstanding but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice. Not hydrating enough for me for nighttime use.\\r\\nThis is one of the best eye moisturizers I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used! It makes eye skin so soft and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super light on your skin. It spreads so much even if you only use a little bit. I would recommend this if you need a good eye cream\\r\\nOh my god this is my favorite eye cream right now. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like super moisturizing y\\xe2\\x80\\x99all! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not harsh at all. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gentle and light weight. I mean it is super super expensive in my opinion. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost 50$ but I love it so much and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to buy again.\\r\\nLOVE THIS EYE CREAM! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cooling and moisturizing while still feeling light. Blends in very well, and sits perfectly under makeup. Not to mention, I LOVE the packaging, the blue looks gorgeous on my shelf.\\r\\nI absolutely love the belif products they work so well to hydrate and refresh your skin and that exactly what this cream does for you under eye. This is so amazing it hydrates your under eye area and leaves it soft and moist.\\r\\nThe eye cream is spiked with comfrey leaf and pennywort herb. The cooling effect helps with puffiness. It is refreshing on the eyes and it absorbs really easily.\\r\\nHands down my favorite eye cream I have ever tried EVER my eyes are very sensitive so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very careful with what I put near them and this baby is safe enough for eyes and gets up close and personal with hydrating and de puffing. Day night and before makeup this is my bff for hydration\\r\\nI was introduced to Belif\\'s Moisturizing Eye Bomb through a subscription box sample. It was, no lie, love st first feel! I have tried so many eye creams, from drugstore to high-end and this little gem is my new HG. Like legitimate holy grail, search is over, my ride or die! My concealer has never looked better. My main problem with eye area has always been dryness under the eye allowing concealer or foundation to settle in to every single fine line I could possibly have. Eye creams I had tried always left my eyes feeling sticky, tight and uncomfortable. I was definitely skeptical about trying this one out. Just the name, moisturizing eye bomb, immediately had me thinking this product would feel like the rest. Heavy, sticky and uncomfortable. Let me just say, I was WRONG. The eye bomb is never sticky, it\\'s a very lightweight moisturizer that packs such a hydrating punch without feeling too greasy or too heavy. Before using this, my eyes always seemed dull. The delicate skin around them, so dehydrated looking. I had pretty much given up on finding a product that could do what I needed it to. No need to give up now! This moisturizer visibly pumps skin which minimized the look of all those dehydrated fine lines I had before. My concealer sits beautifully on top of it and I can\\'t imagine my skincare routine with put this being apart of it. Ladies, if you have similar problems to what I had, do your self a favor, go pick some of this eye cream and then thank me later ;)  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI absolutely love this eye cream!  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little pricey, but I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth it.  A little bit goes a long way.  I put some in my fridge and with my makeup.  It gives my under eyes much needed moisture.  I will continue to by it unless I find something else to replace it. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nGot this in a Sephora Play box. Thought it would be great to hydrate the dry skin on my lids from scrubbing off makeup. Unfortunately the next morning my eyes were swollen shut and burned like crazy.  My eyes look bruised almost. It\\'s super painful. I can\\'t believe this happened from a freaking cream made for your eyes.\\r\\nCan I just say this is the most fabulous and amazing eye cream I have ever used. I have dry skin and under my eyes is no different it\\'s always very dry and there\\'s always lots of puffiness to and dark circles. This was recommended to me by a close friend who has similar skin not exact skin as I do but hers is very similar she does have a little bit of oil issues and I don\\'t I\\'m just dry and Flaky all day long. This however is amazing I put it on the very moment it touched my skin I felt refreshed I felt revitalized I felt like a human being and not a walking chalk stick. I did start only using it at night because it\\'s so expensive and I really really really didn\\'t want to be burning through this product. It has done amazing things for my skin I use it in the morning and at night before bed. This is worth the investment a little bit goes a very long way this product will last you a long time you will get your money\\'s worth.\\r\\nReally good, it gives a sensation of freshness on the skin, it is quite light and smells good. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI absolutely love this eye cream!! I use it about 3 times a day, super easy to put on, I have a sample size and its lasted for 3 months now! love the way it feels on my skin, and it has literally gotten rid of my dark circles! you will not regret getting this!\\r\\nVery Moisturizing I Use It Every Morning And Night. Its Didint Irritate My Eyes Or Around Them.\\r\\nThis is my favorite eye cream! I have really dry under eyes and using this helps minimize creasing when I set my under eye concealer.\\r\\nWow. Totally in love ever since I got this in my Box Box I have used every single night and will continue to\\r\\nSuper hydrating eye product. I find that if I use this at least ten minutes before I start my makeup, it helps keep my eye area from looking too dry under my concealer. Love using this at night and waking up to eyes that don\\'t look as tired as I feel. I had a sample that I really liked. This is a bit pricey but I may look into purchasing a full size because it really is a nice moisturizer\\r\\nPretty damn good . Worth the money . Great for eyes . Smells great . It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a must buy for anyone with under eye concerns\\r\\nI enjoy using this eye bomb at night before bed. It has a cooling feeling and subtle natural scent. My favorite part is that this product absorbs nicely into my skin and does not leave behind any residue.\\r\\nI  love  love  love  this prodact ..my body need to strong   prodact like this my mum try it befor  \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4 i hope to get it more and more in near feuture \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d\\r\\nLove this moisturizer! Is seriously a moisturizing bomb! Isn\\'t oily and leaves my eyes feeling so soft even in Chicago winters. I\\'ve even used it other places like my poor winter dry nose.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI got a little sample with my online purchase and I\\'m saving money to buy a full size and eventually more items in the line. It hydrates under my eyes perfectly and makes my bags less noticeable. Feels very fresh. Smells like herbs. This product truly makes me feel comfortable in my skin and I\\'m ugly so it\\'s a big deal.\\r\\nThis product does it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s described job- it IS moisturizing. However, that is all this product does. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily de-puff my morning eyes or have any anti-aging properties. Still a good product though.\\r\\nHydrating, moisturizing, I love it! My first bottle has lasted me for a long time, a little goes a long way.\\r\\nI just recently started using this product. I have noticed a decrease in my puffiness and dark circles. I am definitely a fan of this product. It is very light and creamy and does well underneath my makeup\\r\\nI love this stuff, it really works great. It keeps my eye area moisturized/ hydrated and boost the elasticity.\\r\\nRecibi este producto en una caja de regalo. Me parece un buen hidratante de ojos. Buen olor. Pero un poco espeso lo que obliga a hacerlo con un poco de fuerza.\\r\\nThis is a really nice eye cream. It feels very moisturizing under the eye and has this slight tingling feeling. It works good and my eyes feel refreshed when I put it on. Highly recommend to everyone.\\r\\nI like this so much I always try to get my dark cicle moisturized and this is so perfect.\\r\\nI have dry skin and sometimes my undereye gets super dry and this stuff is amazing for it. It hydrates without being to thick and goopy. Nice gel like consistency that absorbs right into the skin. I use at night and in morning before I apply makeup.\\r\\nI received this in a VoxBox and I am still using it. I\\'m actually getting dangerously close to finishing it and having a bit of a panic attack. And I\\'m a product whore, so wanting to stick with one product is a pretty big deal for me. This eye cream is more of a gel texture and sinks in quickly while leaving you feeling hydrated and a bit plumped. I found that it worked equally as well at night as under makeup in the morning. I have sensitive skin and this didn\\'t cause any irritation or bumps around the eye delicate eye area. This has been a total life saver this winter, and it\\'s lightweight texture promises to work just as well in our southern summers, so I am going to be keeping one of these on my vanity!\\r\\nI thoroughly enjoy using this product. I was sent this to test for Influenster and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really happy I was. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pleasant and cooling feeling when applied. It immediately hydrates and sinks in quite quickly. I would wait 10-15 minutes before applying concealer just to ensure it has completely sunk in though. When I apply it at night I wake up to really smooth, hydrated under-eyes. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never thought eye creams are necessary because of using a daily/nightly moisturizer that I just bring all the way up to under my eyes but I could see myself purchasing this one when I run out of the one I was sent. The texture of this is unlike any other eye cream (or moisturizer for that matter) and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gel-like formula is what sets it apart from the others. I love that belif is cruelty free and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily break the bank with their products. This will not get rid of fine lines or wrinkles but it does visibly hydrate and create a more wide-eye awake look.\\r\\nI was so excited to try this item and when I received it, I was so happy. However, the product didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live up to my expectations. The area around my eye did not feel more moisturized but rather dry. I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be purchasing this item in the future.\\r\\nThis eye cream instantly hydrated my under eye. It very effective and brightens the under eye. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gentle for the under eye and a little goes along way. I received a sample and would definitely repurchase this in a full size.\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is in my opinion a great product.  It is very moisturizing and does not have any strong fragrance to it.  I can not tell if there is a noticeable  difference with any lines or wrinkles but my skin is less dry.\\r\\nGot this in my Sephora playbox and while I love how this eye gel feels after applying BUT it makes my eyes water extremely bad!!....After a few uses passed this on to my mom who likes it and has no issues with it and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make her eyes water.\\r\\nThank you Sephora Play! Box for introducing me to this miracle eye cream! It is so lightweight and silky, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect for unwinding at the end of the day under the eyes. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any scent and does an excellent job at moisturizing and making your eyes look refreshed and renewed in the morning. Love it!\\r\\nmy circle of my eyes is very dark and when im try this product of belif moisturizing eye bomb my eyes be beautiful i can not how i describe my eyes . my eyes be very light and wonderful this product it is very awesome i wish to you also try this product good luck\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nLOVE this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part of my nightly ritual and it makes the skin around my eyes SO soft and moisturized! I love to use it with their regular moisturizing bomb for the whole face! Absolutely recommend this product!\\xc2\\xa0Also its scent-free which I love.\\r\\nThis is a great eye cream that I use in the morning and at night. It is super hydrating and I love how it feels on my face! I got this for free from influenster to try out! Thank you guys!!\\r\\nOne of the best moisturizers I have used on my skin. This product is very effective and gentle on my sensitive skin. I am a first time buyer and would buy it again. I recommend this.\\r\\nsuper thick, yet an interesting watery texture. I love how this product feels on my eyes and the intense hydration it consistently delivers. I\\'ve never used such a hydrating product before belif, and now I\\'m a belifer! A bit pricey, which is why I tried the deluxe sample from Sephora.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nGot this in a sub box and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve really enjoy the hydration it gives my eye area. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet noticed anything else happening as far as wrinkles and what not but in all fairness I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only been using it for a week so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give it more time and then come back and update. I will say I love this brand and am excited to keep using my sample.\\r\\nThis is a great product. It is an undereye cream , but I use it on my whole face. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect in the winter for protecting delicate facial skin. The only thing I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t love is the scent. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not bad, at all. It just reminds me of how wet wipes smell.\\r\\nI really like some of their other products...and this one is \\xe2\\x80\\x98okay\\xe2\\x80\\x99. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not phenomenal. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice any significant difference. But it was gentle and it actually made for a good eye primer because of the consistency...\\r\\nThis product is extremely rich, so I have been using it as a night cream. It feels a bit heavy during the day, so I have been alternating this with\\xc2\\xa0 Origins GinZing Refreshing Eye Cream to Brighten & Depuff On-the-Go . It works wonders if your eyes are dry, and it helps with the dark circles, too. Also because it is rich, a single drop of this product goes a long way.\\r\\nI received this in my Sephora play box today  and I\\'m impressed.  I will definitely buy the larger size. Fresh scent, and plump up my saggy eyes. I\\'m 37, this will be an everyday product.\\r\\nLOVE LOVE this!!  So moisturizing, great consistency and the smell is amazing. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI been using this for 2 months now, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really see much of a difference. I have dry under eyes  and texture I guess you can say and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much for me but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still better than no cream\\r\\nThis eye cream is too heavy for me and migrated into my eye no matter how little I apply, I need something creamier that absorbs more quickly. I like this brand but I prefer the water versions to the creams.\\r\\nI love belif products. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m already a diehard fan of the True Aqua Bomb, so I was pumped to  get the True Eye Bomb from Influenster to try for free. The Eye Bomb didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t disappoint; theres a reason that it sells out at Sephora on a regular basis. This eye cream is silky and ultra hydrating. It keeps my eyes from having that thin, dry feeling all day long!\\r\\nThe Belif moisturizing eye bomb is amazing product. I have been using it every morning and evening for almost 4 weeks. The area around eyes becomes looking healthier. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. The texture of cream very lightweight. It absorbs instantly and leaves the skin around my eyes super hydrated. it feels so cool and refreshing on the skin.\\r\\nIm not huge on eye creams because i really don\\'t need them. I dont get dry skin around my eyes or dark circles. Since i found thia eye cream, i realized WHY i need one. It has got rid of my crows feet almost completely and i see an improvement in my skintone around my eyes. I was not a believer but this product is a game changer!\\r\\nAbsolutely LOVED LOVED THIS PRODUCT! Omg my skin felt so moisturized. I WILL be buying this and also trying other Belif products because of how much I love what this does for my face. I also loved the packaging, it sticks out so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something you can easily spot in your make up bin to put on!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis eye cream is fantastic! Eye creams usually do next to nothing for my sensitive, dark, dry eyes. I sampled this eye cream and it was love at first application. The formula is a velvety, soft gel cream that absorbs quickly and deeply moisturizes without being heavy or greasy. It almost seems to instantly plump and brighten as well! Highly recommend this one!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI absolutely love this product! This is my first time using it. It absorbs very easily and a little goes a long way. I would certainly purchase this when my Eye Cream runs out. The only thing that I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care for is the packaging. The container is like the size of a face cream, which is misleading when you look at it.\\r\\nBelif\\'s \\'The True Cream\\' Moisturizing Bomb was already a staple in my evening skin care lineup, so I was really excited to try the eye bomb. It didn\\'t disappoint! The thick formula is intensely moisturizing but magically doesn\\'t feel heavy or greasy; it absorbs into the skin and feels really soothing. I use it in my nighttime routine and wake up looking refreshed and hydrated. A little goes a long way, so it\\'s a great value for the package size.\\r\\nI LOVE this moisturizer! I have very dry skin and the delicate area around the eyes is always the first to show this under concealer and foundation especially when setting it with a powder. This moisturizer has changed everything! The fine lines and creases are much less noticeable and I love the gel consistency of this formula. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightweight but long lasting and is never sticky. I use this every morning and night and my eyes have never looked better!\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like splash of refreshments on your under eye, I used it in the morning as well before bed.\\r\\n\"Provides intense moisture up to 26h\" and I believe that! Skin under my eyes is visibly more hydrated and glowy. Cream works really well with make up as well since it soaks in so quickly. I enjoy the verbena/lemon like scent which is also not overwhelming and dissapear with application. A little goes a long way so the price is more than reasonable. I wish it fighted fine lines also because just the hydration is not enough for me. This product is overall really good and I would recommend it in a heartbeat IF you are between 18-25 (or younger) and don\\'t care about your fine lines (yet) OR have really dry skin.\\r\\nI love how this product works for me. It keeps my under eye area hydrated. If I missed using it I tend to get some rashes so I pretty much use it everyday. Hopefully, I will be seeing the rsults that I wanted to see in the future. Highly recommended.\\r\\nI hadn\\'t heard of this brand before I received it for free in my Influenster VoxBox in exchange for my honest review. I love that the brand uses natural botanical ingredients, that is always a plus in my book! I\\'ve had crows feet for YEARS (thanks genetics), and have a hard time with makeup settling into the fine lines around my eyes. After using this moisturizing eye bomb for about 2 weeks now, I am already pleased to see the difference in plumpness around my eyes. This stuff is magic and I will definitely purchase when I run out! Highly reccommend!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used a few different eye creams since giving birth earlier this year. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m always on the hunt for the perfect one. belif\\xe2\\x80\\x99s is hands down the best I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used to date. It feels super creamy and hydrating but absorbs quickly. It pairs well with all of my concealers and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t smear all over my face when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m applying my makeup on top of it. I use this during the day and alternate between this and Kiehl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s creamy avocado eye cream at night. I received this product complimentary through Influenster.\\r\\nI received this product complimentary from Influenster and have been using it faithfully, morning and evening, for almost 4 weeks. I belif Moisturizing Eye Bombstruggle with fine lines (lots of outdoor sports as a teen!), dryness, puffiness, and pretty much every other issue in the eye area. I swore nothing would top my holy grail Bobby Brown, but this may just be a tough competition! The consistency is smooth and silky and the hydration is UNREAL, but absorbs so quickly and effectively. I have seen an improvement in fine lines, and this makes my eyes look brighter all day. I also love that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my eyes or eye area (which also tends to happen with eye creams for me). I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m usually unimpressed with eye creams/gels, but this one has made a fan out of me and I will definitely purchase when my first container is empty!\\r\\nGood eye cream overall, gel texture, light scent. But if you have dry skin or like thicker textures - you\\'ll want more. I always felt like applying something on top of it. But if you\\'re looking for light eye cream - it will work good for you. For everybody else I recommend peat miracle cream from them.\\r\\nI\\xef\\xb8\\x8f received this free in a vox box and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so grateful I\\xef\\xb8\\x8f did. I\\xef\\xb8\\x8f cannot comment on pricing. The quality of the product is incredible. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a smooth almost slippery texture/gel like that really sinks in quickly. Most eye creams I\\xef\\xb8\\x8f don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice much of a difference I\\xef\\xb8\\x8f just kinda use them and hope it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a long term game but this I\\xef\\xb8\\x8f notice a hydration difference immediately. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost a cooling feel too which helps with puffieness. I\\xef\\xb8\\x8f absolutely love this eye cream especially paired with the belif face moisturized, slightly heavy cream but really soaks in. I\\xef\\xb8\\x8f live in a very cold state this winter and these two products are really helping my skin!\\r\\nThese cream moistorizing was my first eye cream and is a great choice! I have oil skin and leave my skin under my eye soft and brigth all day, loving these!!\\r\\nI\\'m always scared to try new skin products because I break out but I didn\\'t for this product! This eye cream is very light and moisturizing and I highly recommend. I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes.\\r\\nI love this eye cream! I received it a few days ago complimentary to test out from Influenster, but I have been using Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb for over a year now and I am a huge fan. I was looking for a great eye cream with a good price and I found it. It has met all my expectations when it comes to moisturizing my eye area and improves elasticity immensely! My eye area is so smooth when using this, it really plumps up fine lines before concealer. Makeup looks good over it. As for reducing puffiness, it\\'s not the best but if you are looking for hydration and elasticity this is \"the one\". I\\'m pretty much a skincare junkie, I am obsessed with Korean skincare and this is a hit in Korea! I fell in love with Belif products, I\\'ve got my mom using them too! Try it, you wont disappointed!\\r\\nThis product has great vitamins packed in it and it\\'s very creamy and light weight but at the same time very very effective also I think it works beautifully under makeup.\\r\\nI love this moisturizer so much! I purchased mine a couple months ago and it\\'s a bit on the pricey side but it\\'s definitely worth it. It helps keep my makeup on through the whole day. I would recommend this to everyone. One thing I love about it the most is that I have sensitive skin and it doesn\\'t irritate me at all, it keeps my face feeling fresh!\\r\\nI really enjoy this eye cream. I tend to get dry under eyes and I have really sensitive skin so many eye products break me out. This does not at all! It is smooth and light and a little goes a long way. It really helps with hydration and smoothing but is not overall anti aging. If u want to start using eye cream start here.\\r\\nAMAZING. this is holy grail status. it helps so much with my extremely dry and sensitive skin. you can\\'t go wrong with this.\\r\\nYou can never go wrong with this product. I have the whole set. It\\'s a great value not very pricey. The formula is amazing. You really do feel moisturized and hydrated both under your eyes and all over your belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb belif Don\\'t Be Flaky Set\\r\\nI love the belif products, I use the aqua waterbomb cream and it\\'s so lovely. It really does an amazing job and moisturizing my skin, my face gets very dry at times and I find that\\'s the only moisturizer that truly exceeds in giving my skin the proper hydration.\\r\\nThis eye cream is amazing. It is great for all skin types & def helps with wrinkles or dryness under the eye. It\\'s soo soothing & really give the eye a boost of hydration.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI first received this as a sample. Since then I have been a customer. It really does miracles. It\\'s a little pricey but it is worth it.\\r\\nI like this creme for the eyes like a lot I use every day good value good price good long nice price I would like to buy again nice packaging is good affordable price I would like to recommend to other its nice its pretty good for every i love it this product \\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI absolutely love the belif brand. I have several creams and one of them is the eye cream. It soaks right in and doesn\\'t make your skin feel greasy. I love how smooth it makes your skin feel too. Others soak in and really don\\'t make your skin feel like you did anything to it, but this doesn\\'t disappoint. It does what it says. It\\'s well worth it too.\\r\\nI  had to give \\xf0\\x9f\\x8c\\x9f\\xf0\\x9f\\x8c\\x9f\\xf0\\x9f\\x8c\\x9f\\xf0\\x9f\\x8c\\x9fbecause of the sensitive nature of this cream,I hope the price is good and you get value for your money,am willing to try this cream whenever it\\'s available for sampling as it will work well with my sensitive skin.\\r\\nI love the texture and how moisturizing it is. A little goes a long way. Right now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using a trial size once daily and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lasted me several weeks and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still so much left!\\r\\nMoisturizing but not too heavy! Kind of a gel cream consistency that sinks into the skin quickly. Slight fragrance but it does not bother my eyes.\\r\\nLove this because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very light and made of safe Ingredients. It does well alone or under makeup. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it for several months and definitely will continue to and I will purchase again. Highly recommended!\\r\\nThis is my favorite eye cream. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too heavy and leaves my under eyes feeling so smooth. I can see it working on my tired eyes throughout the week. The packaging is a little bulky for how much product you actually get, but I still love it\\r\\nThis a decent eye cream but it just wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t thick enough for me personally. I have dry eye area and prefer something a little thicker. It does sink in nicely though and I think people with slightly less dry skin would really enjoy it.\\r\\nI really enjoyed this product and how soft and moisturizing it was under my eyes.. I enjoyed the texture of the product compared to others as well. I have tried many different eye creams and serums being an ipsy and boxycharm subscriber but i prefer this one most definitely.\\r\\nGreat moisturizing eye cream that keeps my skin hydrated all day. Many eye creams give me milia around my eyes, but this one did not.\\r\\nThis is the best eye cream to wear under makeup. My eyelids are SO sensitive to eye creams and I can 100% tolerate this one. I know the bar is really low with that statement but most eye creams make my lids red, puffy, and irritated and this one doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I only use this in the morning since it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a better formula under makeup than the one I use at night (khiels creamy avocado)\\r\\nNice Product, keeps under eye moisturzed, I have been using the travel size, so the packaging is really small. Not sure if I will purchase separately but I will keep using it while I have it.\\r\\nI bought a pack of sample sizes so I could try multiple Belif products. I love this bc it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super light on the eyes yet totally hydrating.\\r\\nVery hydrating on the eyes and also very sensitive. I would repurchase this product.\\r\\nIf your under eye area is dry at all, buy this! I like to keep mine in my skin care mini fridge as the coolness feels amazing under my eyes and helps with puffiness. Beyond hydration, this eye cream does nothing for dark circles or fine lines. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect for layering with other eye creams though, and with the amount of hydration it provides, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth the purchase. Not to mention, a little goes a long way. The price is reasonable considering it lasts forever and minimal product is needed for full coverage of under the eyes.\\r\\nThis product is really soothing around my eyes, especially during the winter months when my skin is dry. It also works well for dry and flaky patches on your face without making your skin oily or greasy.\\r\\nI have never found an eye cream that I could actually tell a difference from but this one is so smoothing and hydrating, but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave a weird residue or sticky feeling on my skin. It also has a slight cooling feeling and I love the way it smells.\\r\\nThis is so lightweight but very hydrating! It smooths our the skin making a perfect base for concealer. I have very sensitive eyes and this doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bother me at all. A little bit goes a long way. Def recommend.\\r\\nSuch a beautiful, light weight & hydrating eye moisturizer! Def recommend and a little goes a LONG way!!\\r\\nI really like this eye cream.  It is a light cream that has a cooling effect upon application.  It absorbs quickly and leaves my eye area feeling very moisturized and soft to the touch.  It does not leave a residue.  It has a light pleasant slightly floral scent I would recommend trying this cream.  I plan to repurchase it in the future.\\r\\nBelief Moisturizing Eye Bomb is a very nice lightweight eye cream that goes very well under makeup. It really smooths the under eye area without being greasy, good for sensitive eyes and skin, very gentle and has a cooling feel.\\r\\nI received this product free form Influenster for testing purposes! This product really grew on me after continued use. I have not always been one to use skincare but recently have sought out quality products that do what they say they will. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice any differences with fine lines but believe it does do a great job hydrating (which could impact fine lines long term). I feel as if this product would be great to use in colder temperatures for additional hydration. :)\\r\\nLove it! This product is the real deal! Firstly, I do love belif products, but this eye bomb lives up to my expectations. It has the classic rich, moisturizing gel. A little goes a long way. You will look more awake and refreshed! Layers well with other@skincare products and dries down quickly.\\r\\nMy sensitive skin soaked this right up! The lid twists off easily which is important because of my arthritis AND my hands are usually damp during my skincare routine. I noticed a difference within a few days.\\r\\nLeaves the under eye area super hydrated and supple. Not a sticky formula.  The packaging fits the name; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an aqua bomb. More than met my expectations! If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting to the age where you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re needing an eye cream this is a must try! Belif makes great products, this is no exception.\\r\\nI have been using this eye cream for a little over a month and it works well on my eyes. It\\'s not greasy and goes on easily. A little does go a long long way. I highly recommend trying this one.\\r\\nThis product is hydrating and gentle  to sensitive skin. Although this product is pricey, it works.\\r\\nI got/received a mini size of the belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. I\\'ve tried & love their moisturizing bomb for my dry skin & my SO loves their aqua bomb for his normal/combo skin. The eye bomb has a gel like consistency but is slightly on the thicker side - similar to the moisturizing bomb. However, it feels really moisturizing on the skin. It has a soft / barely there scent which is nice. I would definitely consider purchasing the full size product. \\r\\nMoisture Bomb is the name and Moisture is its game. Omg if you have dry skin you need to check this out. I use it to help my skin get some extra moisture during these summer months. The texture is so smooth. I have fine lines around my eyes but when I use this under eye moisturizer my concealer doesn\\'t settle in my lines.\\r\\nLove this eye treatment. One of my favorite. I use it every night before bed. And can already see results after 2 weeks!\\r\\nThis is a great eye cream. It definitely adds moisture to the under eye area. I typically use it as my nighttime eye cream.\\r\\nAbsolutely loved this eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incredibly light and has a subtle but nice scent to it. My eyes definitely feel hydrated and moisturized after apply this! For sure purchasing more in the future\\r\\nMy friend got me this for my bday and so far I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been thoroughly enjoying this baby. It hydrated your under eyes really well. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basically a light weight moisturizer for your eyes. If you have dry under eyes this is your dream. If you want to brighten then this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t your thing.\\r\\nAmazing!!! So hydrating, goes on smooth, absorbs well and stays hydrated. My favorite eye cream. The smell is great too. I\\'m a repeat user of the eye bomb, going back after trying a few others. The color of the jar is beautiful too. Love it!! My fav!\\r\\nI get super dry eyes that flake if I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use the right kind of eye cream. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this for a year and love it!! It always makes my eyes bright and keeps them soft and hydrated.\\r\\nThis eye cream is simply amazing I have really dry eyes and I wear contacts this is instant hydration in life it also helps with my dry teary-eyes! \\xef\\xbf\\xbc I also got this from Influenster and ordered more from Ulta because I liked it so much!! \\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nI am not an eye cream expert so I will just give my honest review about the Eye Bomb. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried another eye creams before and this one is not spectacular nor a bad one. I liked that it is not too heavy! It has a lightweight texture and it does give a good feeling of moisture. Not sure about the 26hr long lasting hydration, but I like applying at night due to the extra moisture. For my taste, it is too watery for applying makeup on top (depending on the makeup).\\r\\nThis product does make my face feels very hydrated.  I do work outside for atleast 12 hours so when it is applied it does feel as if my skin is absorbing it all !! Love it\\r\\nThis is a good hydrating eye cream and honestly the best part about it is how much product you get. I think this eye cream lasted me for almost a year even while I was using it daily! It layers well under makeup and really moisturizes the eye area well\\r\\nLOOOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE! The gel formula gives a great cooling feeling under the eye. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so hydrating and goes well under makeup. Will buy again and again for sure.\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb This eye cream let the skin so hydrated, it has worked me with my eye contour concerns, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not greasy or heavy, perfect! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nLove this eye moisturizer! It literally plumps up the skin around my eyes. Makes them feel so good!\\r\\nI just started using this product and already love it. It has a slight cooling affect that feels so refreshing and it helps with my under eye circles.\\r\\nI received a sample from allure and omg do I love it. I have a hard time finding something to use around my eyes because that is the most sensitive part of my face and I always seem to get red bumps or burning to a lot of products. But not this. This is such a soothing, moisturizing eye cream. I will absolutely be buying this. It is love at first try.\\r\\nI bought this a few weeks ago after my eyelids getting extremely dry, red, and flakey from using retinol on my face. I have very oily skin, and have never experienced this with my eyes - it was very uncomfortable. This eye cream is magic in a jar! I will be using this from now on. Not only is it incredibly hydrating, but it visibly improved the darkness, fine lines, and elasticity around my eyes. Great value, little goes a long way. Highly recommend! \\r\\nReally great eye cream. I use it every night! It really hydrates the sensitive area without causing milia. The only thing I will say is that you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use this under makeup. It is way too heavy. Works best as a night treatment!\\r\\nI received the belif moisturizing eye bomb in my monthly ispy bag. I love how smooth and silky it feels before I even put it on. After applying the a few days I noticed how the skin around around my eyes feel hydrated and refreshed. My only complaint is that I wish I got a bigger jar, but alittle goes along ways.\\r\\nThis eye bomb is definitely the bomb!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extremely hydrating and has a thick balm consistency. This is the last step in my routine and it smooths out the eye area and seals in moisture. A little bit goes a very long way and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so pleased to have found this.\\r\\nThis is pretty nice but I think it would be better for someone with dryer under eyes than myself.  It was a bit too hydrating, although I may revisit this in the winter time.\\r\\nprobably one of the better eye creams i have tried. my eyes are sensitive, this one does not burn like a few i have tried.\\r\\nThe consistency of this cream was nice and absorbed quickly. Unfortunately I cannot say how well it works with longer use, as the fragrance was one that I can not tolerate around my face, so had to wash it off to avoid eye irritation.\\r\\nThis is a really nice eye cream. It does hydrate but is lightweight so it is not likely to cause milia bumps under the eye. It looks great under concealer. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I will repurchase because I need a little more than just hydration but it is a great one if that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for!\\r\\nThis is my favorite eye cream! I put it on before bed and in the morning. A little goes a long way and it definitely helps get rid of lines and darkness. I have my boyfriend use this after we go out or if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been working late so it works on all skin types. I have sensitive skin but I LOVE it!\\r\\nI love this eye cream texture. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost like Vaseline, but it melts in effortlessly and hydrated immediately.  The moisturize definitely helps my eyes look more awake and helps diminish lines. A great eye cream!\\r\\nBelif eye cream has been the only eye cream I\\'ve ever repurchased. I\\'m usually a believer in using the same cream on my eye area as the rest of my face. This stuff feels ultra luxurious and smells incredibly earthy and natural, yet fresh. The essential oils do not irritate my delicate eye area. I do wish it came in a pump bottle instead of a jar, because I try to avoid contamination with my eye area products. The gel-like feel is very cooling, even if you store this away from a refrigerator!\\r\\nThe sides of my eyes get really dry and this is such a nice relief for that. It feels great and refreshing.\\r\\nActually amazing. Apply under concealer for a smooth application and a plumped under eye. Will keep buying this!\\r\\nMy eyes are very sensitive so I could not be liveral with this cream. However, I do love how it makes my skin lool refreshed.\\r\\nI love the cooling effect this eye cream gives. I put it on before bed and I wake up with hydrates eyes.\\r\\nLove this eye cream. \\xc2\\xa0So moisturizing and does not leave your face looking caked on. I can put makeup over it or just leave as is. It blends super well into my skin and makes my fine lines under my eyes disappear. \\xc2\\xa0I have super sensitive skin so this was perfect for me without adding irritation. The price point is fair for what you are paying for. This was my first purchase, and will definitely get another when I run out. My eyes look 10 years younger.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI am a big fan of Belif products. I received this .15 oz sample in a Beauty Box. It is a blue gel that goes on easily and is absorbed quickly. Does it improve elasticity? Not that I can tell, but how is that measured by a couple of weeks use? Does it last 26 hrs? Again hard to prove. But it is a nice moisturizer that would be great in summer or warm climates.\\r\\nI love this product because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightweight and the eye bomb absorb fast.  I love this eye bomb a lot during  the warmer months.  This product is a great price point.  This eye bomb also works well with make up.\\r\\nSuper hydrating eye moisturizer. Works super well during the day and night. Very effective at what it is supposed to do\\r\\nI haven\\'t been using it long enough to tell you long term benefits, but the products comes with sooooo much and it really does feel moisturizing. I use this at night because it\\'s like a little hydrating mask.\\r\\nA nice moisturizing eye cream that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too irritating, despite the essential oils present. I felt that it was a bit overpriced, though, and you could get similar results from a face cream while having a lower cost and no fragrance. I would recommend this if you really want an eye cream, but otherwise, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a glorified moisturizer.\\r\\nI wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t call this a cream exactly, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a really silky fluffy gel almost? It feels so amazing, soaks in really well, feels super soft and silky, my eyes stay hydrated allllll day, wears great under my makeup. I get tons of eye creams from all my subscription boxes, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how I ended up with this one, I wish I would have tried it sooner, but I will definitely be purchasing a full size soon. A little goes a long way.\\r\\nBelif hat wirklich tolle Produkte, ich denke da kann man nicht viel falsch machen. Allerdings hatte ich bei dem Preis einfach h\\xc3\\xb6here Erwartungen. Ich hatte mir ein deutliches Gef\\xc3\\xbchl der Hydratisierung der Augenpartie erhofft und das ist nicht ganz eingetroffen. Ich neige schon zu Trockenheitsf\\xc3\\xa4ltchen unter den Augen. Die Creme pflegt die Haut, keine Frage, aber ich hatte nicht dieses \\xe2\\x80\\x9emeine Haut f\\xc3\\xbchlt sich an als h\\xc3\\xa4tte sie grad ein Glas Wasser getrunken\\xe2\\x80\\x9c in Ermangelung einer passenderen Beschreibung. Zudem hat mich gest\\xc3\\xb6rt, dass man aufpassen muss die Creme nicht auf die Wimpern zu bekommen, dass es sonst in den Augen brennt. Auch dieser Faktor ist sicherlich bei vielen anderen Augencremes zu beachten, f\\xc3\\xbcr mich jedoch etwas l\\xc3\\xa4stig, weshalb ich da gern zu \\xe2\\x80\\x9evertr\\xc3\\xa4glicheren\\xe2\\x80\\x9c Varianten greifen w\\xc3\\xbcrde. Insgesamt w\\xc3\\xbcrde ich sagen, dass die Creme dem Hype f\\xc3\\xbcr mich nicht ganz gerecht werden konnte. M\\xc3\\xb6glicherweise waren meine Anspr\\xc3\\xbcche allerdings auch \\xc3\\xbcberzogen: das mag ich nicht beurteilen, da ich bisher noch nicht viele Cremes ausprobiert habe.\\r\\nI love this product makes my skin feel so hydrated and makes my eyes look brighter. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s non greasy!\\r\\nOne of my favorite eye creams. Light and potent. Gentle and effective. Love that combination. Nothing too heavy or too watery. You can feel the effects as soon as you apply it. (Similar effect for me as GLAM eye)\\r\\nLove this eye cream! I purchase mine from Avon (since, I am a Rep) and use it daily! Honestly, a pack of natural hydration. Gentle.  What more could I ask for? Except for a lower price. It is pricey, but the value of the product is amazing.\\r\\nI got a sample of this and really liked it. Very hydrating although I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure it helps with lines.\\r\\nI have terrible eczema around my eyes and this is one of the few products gentle enough to not make it flare up. If you have sensitive, temperamental skin this is for sure worth trying. It\\'s gentle yet ultra hydrating and a little goes a very long way.\\r\\nI have never been overly impressed with any eye cream until this one. Most of them have actually been irritating to my eyes but for whatever reason this one, even though it has fragrance, is totally fine for me. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extremely hydrating under my eyes and makes them look less tired and less puffy.\\r\\nIt was okay....I definitely like the Sephora brand more...don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really have any complaints I just didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really like the texture\\r\\nAmazing moisturizing eye bomb.  I use it before my primer for eye makeup. Feels not greasy, goes on smooth.  Perfect for the eye area.  Vey gentle for my eye area. I stock up on this, and love this brand.\\r\\nThis is my go to moisturizer. I have tried so many different moisturizers and always come back to this. It is thick but absorbs quickly and leaves my skin smooth. Living in the Midwest I need all the moisture I can get in the winter!\\r\\nVery moisturizing and a great consistency. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve not had any issues and seems to do a good job. I use at night before bed.\\r\\nI am utterly obsessed with Korean beauty and skincare products. I follow a strict 10 step K Beauty skincare routine. So I was very excited to try this eye cream from Belif. I am 29 and beginning to see the early signs of aging.   I tried to give this a chance, therefore I purchased it twice and used it over a year. Unfortunately, this made NO difference as far as fine lines and dark circles. It is great as far as moisturizing the delicate eye area, but I would NOT recommend this to those looking to address signs of aging.\\r\\nLove this lightweight moisturizer for the summer! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s simple and hydrating. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve recommended it to others who also enjoy it. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI received a sample of this in a Belif kit and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sad to say it sat untouched in my skincare collection for way too long. I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a big believer in eye moisturizers, but after using it for a few weeks, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I can ever go back. The skin around my eyes feels firmer yet soft, makeup sits much better, and hopefully it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helping percent wrinkles!\\r\\nSolid eye cream, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice any immediate difference but these things never work like that. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice to use in the morning, I store it in the fridge for a cooling effect, my eyes feel awake after using this product so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy with it.\\r\\nI really enjoy this product but I wish it was just a tiny bit more hydrating. The scent is nice and it goes on really well but I feel like it could be slightly more hydrating which is why I gave it four stars. Would recommend to others \\r\\nI was on a hunt looking for an eye-cream because I noticed that my eye area toward my temples seemed to be drying out. I purchased this eye bomb hoping that it would hydrate and soothe my eye area but it didnt do much. For a fairly large price of the eyebomb, I didnt see much difference. Yes it did hydrate however thats all it did. Just hydrate, it was the soles purpose of this product to hydrate your eye area yet I wasn\\'t satisfied with its limited abilities. I feel like with the price of this eyebomb, I dont think it was worth it and I am sure that there is more eye-creams or gels that can do so much better within the same price range. When I did use it, it didnt help soothe my dryness and I would wake up with dry-patches in the morning. I dont think this product is worth it.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI thought this was a nice product. The gel formula felt really nice and calming. However I did not see any reduction of fine lines, I think all this did was maybe calm the area around my eye for a while that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about it!\\r\\nGot this product as a gift. I absolutely love it. I never before used anything for my eyes but this product just changed it for me. Absolutely love it\\r\\nNot too overly moisturizing but still a pretty good eye cream. Not too much in the bottle but a very good price point\\r\\nThis is a lovely eye cream. It feels soft, smooth, and cool upon application, and it dries down really well. The under eye area feels moisturized and calm when using the belife Eye Bomb. I really do enjoy all of the products in this line from belief.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis is a great moisturizing eye cream! I apply after cleansing in the am and pm. I\\'m not sure if my under eye looks more youthful (maybe they will over time), but they are hydrated and have a nice glow. It\\'s easy to massage under the eye and does not make my skin burn like other eye creams have done in the past. \\r\\nGreat hydrating eye cream. Very basic helped with moisture but nothing else. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cause any irritation and is a nice consistency. If you are looking for hydration this is great\\r\\nLove the texture of this product and how it soaks into the skin super easily, great product!\\r\\nA little goes a long way with this eye cream and the tub is on the larger side compared to most eye creams in this price range. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s silky and spreads easily. The packaging is nice, easy to open and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to get all of the product out. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very moisturizing and feels good on my skin.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nDidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel much of a difference, good for hydrating the under eye but not her benefits. Like to apply it as a under eye mask during the night.\\r\\nI rarely use eye creams because they just seem like thicker moisturizers to me but I got a sample size of this and it did help out on some of the dry patches I have around my eyes. Nothing a moisturizer couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do though tbh. Also the fragrance burned a bit.\\r\\nThis makes my eyes feel so hydrated and awake when I use it! I have tried so many eye creams before and I finally found one I enjoy\\r\\nOne of my all time favorite eye creams!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sooo rich without causing congestion. My skin feels so hydrated with this. I use it both am and pm.\\r\\nI love this eye cream to wear under makeup. While it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any brightening effect for my dark circles, it keeps my under eye makeup smooth and really helps to prevent creasing. Feels great when chilled in a fridge!\\r\\nI love this eye product. I receive a deluxe sample and it lasted me a whole month. A little goes a long way with this eye gel. It smells fresh and soaks right in. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydrating and does just as advertised. I also find it gentle on my sensitive skin and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sting at all unlike some other eye creams.\\r\\nThis product feels good underneath the eyes, but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice much moisture being added to my skin. I expected a little more from this product, but as of now I will continue to use it until I can find one that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little more moisturizing.\\r\\nI love this eye bomb. It has a smell and it feels so refreshing on my skin. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not greasy and sinks right into the skin.\\r\\nBelif is always a solid brand for skin care for me and this eye cream is no different. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m currently using it as the second to \\xc2\\xa0last step in my nighttime routine and have been really happy with it. My undereyes feel moisturized when I wake up in the morning and haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had any irritation from using it nightly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good moisturizing eye cream.\\r\\nI have mix feeling with this eye cream . Provided very hydration to your eye area , but no improve for fine lines or dark circles\\r\\nVery hydrating/moisturizing. The gel feels cool under your eyes which is a plus and can depuff. I personally don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel the need to have a dedicated eye moisturizer. This is not as rich as a traditional eye cream. No complaints but not a product I would add to my routine.\\r\\nI am constantly trying new eye creams and come across so many that do nothing. This one show results quickly. Worth the money.\\r\\nGreat product.\\xc2\\xa0 Works well at doing what it promises to do and quickly.\\xc2\\xa0 You\\'ll notice a difference after a few nights using it.\\r\\nI just finished a  sample size of this eye cream and I will for sure be purchasing the full size. It was very hydrating and refreshing. It does have a light scent but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind it. I would definitely recommend this product if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for a good moisturizing eye product.\\r\\nFABULOUS consistency and oodles if moisture are in this lovely eye cream. It smells good, doesn\\'t irritate, or cause any unwanted eruptions.  It fits in well with the other products I use and does a great job.\\r\\nIf you have sensitive skin, I would advise you to steer clear of this product. I started using it last week, and within 2 days I had chemical burns around both eyes. My eyelid skin is peeling, and the entire area is reddish brown and on fire. I will never use another product from this brand.\\r\\nI love this eye cream! The price is awesome! It is thick and luxurious feeling. It moisturizes so well. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make my eyes burn when they water or irritate them. Love it!\\r\\nReally like this eye cream. I apply it nightly with my night skin routine and really feel like it has made a difference with fine lines around my eyes.\\r\\nI love this because it helps are on my eye drain is a lot and stopped all the small bombs this is honestly a life saver\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nWish I could give this 6 stars. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. That. Good.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m almost 30 & my skin under my eyes has never looked better. Looking to try more from this brand.\\r\\nBest eye cream! I use this eye cream with my nighttime routine usually. It leaves my under eyes moisturized and has a great smell! I love waking up and having that soft glow under my eyes!\\r\\nI really liked this. It was thick and felt really moisturizing ever time I put it on.  A little went a long way. I never noticed much of a scent which I can always appreciate.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only had a small sample of this, but it has a lovely whipped consistency and definitely feels hydrating.\\r\\nStandard eye cream. Does provide hydration but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not groundbreaking. Would not pay upwards of $40 for this.\\r\\nThis is a great eye cream! I love it for daytime use. Not sure if it helps with darkness or wrinkles but is very hydrating.\\r\\nThis eye cream hydrated my eyes so well!! It is one of my favorite eye moisturizers. I have purchased this over and over again. I highly recommend.\\r\\nAmazing eye cream! You need a tiny amount for both eyes, it\\'s awesome, it\\'ll last you a long time. It absorbs right into my skin. Would definitely get it again in the future. Very gentle and not too rich. Doesn\\'t give me milia under my eyes!\\r\\nSo moisturizing but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave a heavy feeling. Very emollient and absorbs into under eyes very well. Best for a night time eye cream but can be used during the day.\\r\\nThis product is also very light yet very moisturizing for under the eyes. A little pricey for the amount you get, but it works very well with the moisturizer\\r\\nLove this eye cream. As someone with sensitive skin, this works really well under my eyes and is non irritating. I use this as my daytime/morning eye cream on top of serums.\\r\\nThis is great for before makeup application because it makes your under eyes really hydrated and supple looking. I think it actually prevents makeup creasing in fine lines. 4 stars because it is an extra step that can be avoided with the belif Aqua bomb!\\r\\nTHE BEST eye cream on the market. Not greasy or too heavy under the eye, but still hydrating. It soaks in quickly. Makes my under eyes look and feel so much smoother and softer\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this for about 2 years and I think it works great for keeping your under eye moisturized.\\r\\nI would skip this product. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think this really did anything for the skin around my eyes. Personally, to me this feels no different than my regular face lotion. Sometimes when my skin is extra dry it actually burns the skin a little.\\r\\nI love this product because it is one of the best on the market, I don\\'t know what my life would be like without this product, I simply love it, it has made my life more beautiful. Amazing and I love it.\\r\\nAmazing I love the texture and how lightweight it is. I have extremely dry skin and it always feels refreshing to apply.\\r\\nSo beautiful and good. after the tonic and serum, this cream is a real panacea.  absolutely must not miss in a perfect skincare\\r\\nI really love this product. I have really dry under eyes and this hydrates them really well. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my skin and it has a very light natural scent.\\r\\nThis eye cream is excellent. It is very moisturizing and very reasonably priced. It sinks right into your skin. I use it both morning and night and am very happy with the results.\\r\\nI really like this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a thick consistency and really keeps the under eye area moisturized. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a life saver these winter months.\\r\\nI purchased this at Sephora because my under eyes were super dry and it was painful\\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lightweight gel, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely hydrating and I do enjoy it. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the most hydrating eye cream but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give me milia and it does the job! A little goes a long way as well! :)\\r\\nThis is a really nice, thick, moisturizing eye cream. I think it\\'s great to use at night. It reminds me of Aquaphor but more spreadable and luxurious feeling (and not greasy at all!). It didn\\'t cause any irritation for me and didn\\'t bother my eyes at all.\\r\\nOne of my favorite eye creams! Gel-like consistency with a soothing and moisturizing formula. Only downside is the open jar packaging, which is not that hygienic. Always use clean fingers and close right away!\\r\\nI particularly love all products from this brand.

I like this formula in the summer when my skin isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as dry. It absorbs nicely into the skin but leaves a nice barrier to lock the moisture in.\\r\\nI honestly didn\\'t understand the hype of this. It\\'s really not that different from a moisturizing cream, which I personally find much more hydrating than this. I also found it was causing bumps to form under my eyes, so after about 2 weeks of using this, I stopped. About 2 months out, the bumps were gone. Weird.\\r\\nA must. This is a super-hydrating under eye moisturizer. It has minimal smell so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not over whelming, and light enough that it gives you that cool and refreshing feeling after application. I use this product morning and night\\r\\nSuch a great product and so moisturizing! I struggle with eczema (on my hands and eyelids) and this did not aggravate it at all and is very gentle!! You need to try it!\\r\\nI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think this was something I needed until I tried it out as a sample at Sephora!  This product is great for combination skin and is super refreshing for your eyes!  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not sticky or heavy for the under eye area, gives a youthful look, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen improvement with any bags or blemishes in this area.\\r\\nThis feels like a dream under your eye! My under eye is always super dry and this seems to be the only thing that helps it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little pricey but well worth it!\\r\\nI wish I could give this 10 stars!! I love this eye cream. It is very expensive but very worth it. My fine lines disappear and my under eye area stays hydrated easily for 12+ hours. I have repurchased this cream twice now and will continue to do so as I have yet to find anything that compares!\\r\\nOne of, if not the best eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever tried. Comparable to Clinique\\xe2\\x80\\x99s All About Eyes. Absorbs much quicker than the Clinique eye cream. Highly, highly recommend.\\r\\nNice lightweight eye cream. It has a gel texture and it feels cooling to your under eyes. It pairs well with the aqua bomb moisturizer. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as heavy and thick as other eye creams. No visible difference though, it was just a nice feeling.\\r\\nVery beautiful eye cream. Actually it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more of a gel consistency so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very light and refreshing. You can keep it in the refrigerator to give you that cooling feeling. It works perfectly under make up and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not scented so I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it will irritate your sensitive eye area. Highly recommend!\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know I needed this until I got it in a gift set. Now I know what all the rave is about this eye cream!  It was a focus at NY fashion week for years In a row they knew it was like finding gold.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lite creamy and fast drying. A little pricy but for how little you need to apply it will last forever!\\r\\nThis did nothing for me, it wasn\\'t as moisturizing as i thought it would be, i would not purchase again and rather get another brand like clinique.\\r\\nLoooovveee this eye cream. It feels amazing when applied, and after it dries I can literally feel the fine lines tightening. It works wonders and I love using it!\\r\\nI first tried a sample of this that I picked up with my Rewards points. The sample size was thicker and more balmy than the full size, with a consistency somewhat similar to aquaphor (which I often use under my eyes to hydrate/moisturize). I liked it enough that I purchased the full size and the consistencies are slightly different. The full size is more creamy and less thick. I got another sample that was just like the full sized at a later time, so I think the initial sample was a one off.  I like them both and they do hydrate my under eyes well and absorb quickly. They also don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my sensitive eyes and play really well with makeup. One of the most important things you can do to make concealer look it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best is have hydrated under eyes, and this does that for me. The price point may feel a little high, but this is a 25ml eye cream, where as many eye creams are only 15ml, so you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting 10ml more than typical eye creams. All in all though, this is a really bice hydrating eye cream.\\r\\nI recently looked for this product on Sephora and liked the packaging. It is a great moisturizer, I would like it more if it would come in pumping bottle. Yes It worked for me and I am going to buy again.\\r\\nI have tried both the eye and the facial bomb. Although the facial bomb is food, it is very light. I love the eye bomb though because it feels thick but smooth. It is really moisturizing for the under eye area and I love to put this under my makeup. It makes the concealer look really good.\\r\\nThis is my favorite eye cream right now. It\\'s moisturising enough to use both day and night and it layers well under my concealer. I\\'ve noticed more firmness in my my eye area. It also has a pleasant, clean scent that isn\\'t overwhelming. I will be replacing it when I run out!\\r\\nReceived in an Ipsy package. Was definitely very moisturizing. Did what it was supposed to and lasted a long time\\r\\nAll in all, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a much bigger fan of the belief products in white tubs than the ones in blue tubs like this. Gel doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cut it for me now that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in my thirties. It could be the fragrance or other ingredients, but this actually makes my eyes feel tighter like it sucked existing moisture out. three stars because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had worse but definitely not a fan.\\r\\nIf you\\'re looking for a moisturizing eye cream with no actives, this is perfect. It leaves my undereyes hydrated and supple and it\\'s non-irritating. However, it\\'s lightly fragranced so if you\\'re sensitive to scents, you may want to opt for a fragrance-free alternative. I love to keep mine in my beauty fridge and it feels so nice when it\\'s cold!\\r\\nIf you need under eye moisture this product will definitely help you out. I felt like just after one use my under eyes looked and felt less dry. Like all belif products it comes in a tub. I prefer my eye creams to come in a tube or a squeeze pump. I definitely will repurchase as it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a bad product at all.\\r\\nNot the richest cream, which I enjoy, but it was moisturizing. I need a different type of eye cream for older eyes that have dark circles.\\r\\nThis stuff works as advertised, melts into skin nicely and reduces under eye bags. Not the most effective one I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried though.\\r\\nThis is my HG eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super light weight, fast absorbing and wears well under makeup. It has a bit of a cooling effect when you apply it too! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bit expensive, but a little goes a long way.\\r\\nDepuffs eyes and keeps it cool. Also a great brighter as well. Gentle on the eyes. Great product.\\r\\nI love this eye cream! It has a super soothing, cooling effect after applying and it smoothes out my under eye area, making makeup application much easier. I use this after moisturizer and before primer.\\r\\nI noticed that the dark circles around my eyes lighted over the course of a week and the puffiness was also a lot less. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a huge fan of eye creams and this one is definitely one I will be purchasing in the near future. \\r\\nI only received a sample of this to try but I absolutely loved it! The consistency is amazing - extremely hydrating while still being lightweight and easy to wear. My only complaint is the price, it is absurd and the that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t purchase my own eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way too much money and unfortunately, while I loved using my sample size of this product, I cannot justify spending that much money.\\r\\nespero que me llegue, las ojeras es mi sufrimiento de todos los dias !!! en ocasiones el maquillaje no las oculta como me gustaria espero que yo pueda probar lo bueno que esta el producto\\r\\nI really like the formula and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating.  The moisture is very long lasting but never seems to fully absorb so I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like using under makeup.  Unfortunately it irritates my eye rosacea so it got bumped out of the rotation.\\r\\nI have sensitive skin and my skin didn\\'t seem to react well with this. This product was too thick for my under eyes, where I ended up having milia for weeks after just a few days of use. It smells like Proactiv, that familiar citrus smell like all other belif products, so if you\\'re sensitive to scents then this may not be for you\\r\\nTired eyes from work or staring at a phone? This is the perfect instant relief. Just dab some below your eyes and the cooling sensation will make you so relaxed\\r\\nI really enjoyed this eye cream. It was cooling and was super moisturizing. It is really easy to apply too much product, so make sure you use it sparingly. Otherwise I would recommend this product.\\r\\nI used mini size and i love it!! Very well moisturizing my under eyes... belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb.\\r\\nI like this eye cream because of the gel lightweight texture. If it gets into my eyes, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sting or bother me. Usually with creams, it would travel easily from my eyelids and end up irritating my eyes for a few days. However, gave this 4 stars because I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see much of a difference after using for few months. Would recommend if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for moisturizer to hydrate eye area vs. anti wrinkle benefits.\\r\\nCr\\xc3\\xa8me tr\\xc3\\xa8s hydratante mais somme toute tr\\xc3\\xa8s l\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa8re. Tr\\xc3\\xa8s facile \\xc3\\xa0 \\xc3\\xa9tendre et laisse une sensation de fra\\xc3\\xaecheur.\\r\\nMe gusta... C\\xc3\\xb3mo desbanese .. me gusta su aroma... Su texturas.. es buena para mis ojos ... Me encanta..\\r\\nTo be honest I have not use this yet I just have a tiny small container of this moisturizing eye bomb that I got in my Ipsy bag. This and so many others I have yet nor tried. Hope it works great.\\r\\nI\\'ve never tried the product before, but I like to try the new products, and i\\'ve always been able to buy them because I like them.\\r\\nI love this I cream, it was very hydrating, beautiful under concealer and definitely helped my concealer stay set throughout the day with less creasing. There is a generous amount, and for the money I feel it is a really good one! I generally just use a cream under my make up to help stay hydrated throughout the day, and this one is one you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be disappointed with.\\r\\nWorking great. My eyes feel fresh and moisture after wake up. However, the texture is a little bit thicker than the Clique eyes gel that I used before, but not really a bit deal.\\r\\nThis is an excellent Under Eye moisturizer! I love this for everyday, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my favorite on heavy makeup days. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use it in my Under Eye are, on and around my brows, as well as around my nose and any other dry patches I see on my face. If you use a lot of powder to set your makeup or wear heavy amounts of eyeshadow, this is the product for you! It leaves my skin feeling mostly non-greasy and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mess up my makeup on any way. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a nice gentle scent so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d even recommend this for sensitive skin and every day use!\\r\\nMe gustar\\xc3\\xada probarlo para poder dar mi opini\\xc3\\xb3n sobre el producto y hacer la rese\\xc3\\xb1a en la web y p\\xc3\\xa1ginas sociales y recomendar a las influensters de esta web y en mi \\xc3\\xa1mbito familiar y social y a las influensters de esta web y en mi \\xc3\\xa1mbito familiar y social #voxbox #influenster\\r\\nGreat little eye cream. My skin feels moisturized and looks less puffy. When I first started using it I thought it had a slight cooling effect but I no longer feel it. It applies easily and offers good hydration for the price.\\r\\nThis soaks in fast. I find it refreshing in the morning. I love the whole line of products.\\r\\nThis eye cream was good, but not my favourite. It was hydrating, but it didn\\'t seem to have any lasting hydration effects. I have. many other eye creams that I far prefer, plus this product is challenging to buy where I live.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI love this moisturizer because it absorbed quickly into my skin and helped plump up my skin filling in my fine lines\\r\\nLove the fresh feeling it leaves but i haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed a real difference in my undereye.. i wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy it again.\\r\\nVery moisturizing eye cream so if you have dry under eyes this is a great product. However if you have dark circles this won\\'t necessarily brighten the under eyes.\\r\\nI got a sample of this and just ordered a whole bottle. Made the skin around my eyes so smoooooth and hydrated.\\r\\nVery moisturizing and refreshing after a long day. It adds an extra plumpness to the under eye and smooths out any lines for my oily-combination skin.\\r\\nThis was an amazing product. I received a small sample but was instantly hooked on it. Felt so revitalizing\\r\\nLong story short, I just didn\\'t see any changes in my under eyes with this product. I couldn\\'t tell if it was hydrating, changing, anything etc. I gave it a couple stars only because I liked the texture. I\\'m a huge fan of water based textures, so that I enjoyed. Plus it comes in a fairly decent sized jar, so I can say it is very long lasting but not something I\\'d purchase again.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI liked the texture and feel of this cream and had purchased it after hearing many rave reviews, but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find it hydrated my under eyes as much as I was expecting it to. I did find it lasted a while, which for the price it should, but wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t repurchase.\\r\\nThis is 5 star product if you need intense moisture, but I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that it plumps the eye area. It feels good when you put it on and dries pretty quickly. Best for cold environments or dry, flaking eye area. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fall under either category but still enjoy using it every week.\\r\\nLeaves my under eyes feeling very fresh. Very gentle, not harsh at all. I love the texture.\\r\\nI have received the eye bomb at beautycon and in several beauty subsctiption boxes. Last a long time, a little goes a long way and eye bomb is a hydrating eye cream.\\r\\nThis moisturizing eye bomb has become my new favorite daytime addition to my skincare routine. It\\'s the last thing I apply before the start of my day. I LOVE how lightweight it feels, how quickly it absorbs, and its refreshing, clean fragrance.\\r\\nLove it was my first moisturizers to use and truly loved it.  It has that great gel cream consistency thats truly amazing.\\r\\nThis really is helpful for under the eyes. Creamy, light texture. Hardly a smell which is good since it goes on face and so close to eyes. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using for Awhile! Will buy again forsure.\\r\\ni love the feel of this! it\\'s lightweight and amazing! not greasy nor heavy. I have sensitive skin so it\\'s been a lot of hit or miss!\\r\\nThis is an excellent cream for dry skin. It smells great, not overpowering. It\\'s very hydrating and a little goes a long way. You don\\'t need much so a jar lasts a really long time.  This is great especially for a product in this price range. #influensterawards #influenster #belifusa\\r\\nI love this moisturizer!! It\\'s the best I\\'ve found for dry skin. It\\'s lightweight and smells great! I will continue to use it until I\\'m at least 100 years old \\r\\nI bought a trial size of this product so that I could see if I liked it. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really tell if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing anything. It might be my fault because I use it sporadically. However, I do like the cool feeling that it has when I put it on. I like to put it on when my eyes feel puffy.\\r\\nDa la hidratacion en la zonas de ojos me encanta \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x96  lo uso diario dia y noche para prevenir las arrugas y siento esa zona super hidratada\\r\\nI was looking for an eye cream and after looking at the reviews online, I decided to try belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. I loved it, especially after I put it in the fridge overnight, it feels cooling on my eyes. I live in a dry climate so I love that it\\'s super moisturizing. Would definitely recommend this eye cream! \\r\\nThis is very moisturizing for my sensitive and dry under eye area. I like to use this during the day as it keeps my concealer from creasing.\\r\\nThis is ultra moisturizing. I love how it sinks in. However, one star taken because it just has an overwhelming perfume! I like scented creams. Not a problem. But the scent in this one just hits me.\\r\\nThis smells nice. When I use it, the area under my eyes feels hydrated so it definitely does its job. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it does anything for fine lines or wrinkles though. I would still recommend it for puffy under eyes.\\r\\nThis really brought the moisture back to my eyes! I had dry under eyes from lack of sleep and stress. Although it helped minimally with dark bags, I knew I had moisturized eyes that would not dry out if I used concealer that day.\\r\\nGreat eye cream. It is very moisturizing for the under eyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little pricey but the results are absolutely phenomenal and in the end I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth it to have such smooth and hydrated under eyes.\\r\\nI love how cooling, lightweight, energizing, and hydrating this formula was.

I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use this product every night (in my late 20s probably should!) but when I use it my eyes love it!\\r\\nIf hydration is what you care about most under the eyes, this is great. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too thick but gives a lot of hydration and sits well under makeup. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also nowhere near as expensive as a lot of other eye creams!\\r\\nI like this ! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very moisturizing and a little goes a long way !! That was my first time using this product ! I definitely did notice a difference at my under eyes !\\r\\nI like this product because my eyes are very dry. And I have good feeling around my eyes after applying this eye cream.\\r\\nI love using this product and it gets me in the habit of using eye cream. I like how refreshing it is and much better my understanding area looks after using it.\\r\\nLove this product! My eyes are large and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always had fine lines, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so happy to find an eye product that actually worked! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only been using it for a couple weeks but I definitely see a difference, hands down the best eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever tried! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating and lightweight, it feels really great on your skin!\\r\\nVery moisturizing, this keeps my skin nice and soft. It absorbs quickly but I wait a little bit before layering other products to prevent piling.\\r\\nThis is a serious contender for my favorite eye cream ever. It\\'s a little more pricey compared to some other popular eye creams on the market, but you get a ton of product, so it lasts a long time. This is super nice and hydrating; I found that my under eye area almost never looked dry and crusty, even with layers of concealer and powder, after using this product in the morning. I went through 2 or 3 of these and then took a break to try some other things, but I would definitely repurchase this and highly recommend to anyone struggling with dry undereyes.\\r\\nThis product made my under eyes look less puffy and dark. It it worked really well and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel sticky or greasy. Really loved this product.\\r\\nI love this product and how it feels. I have very sensitive skin, specially in the under eye area and this product did not cause any irritation. It helped tremendously with lines and creases but overall I think it\\'s a bit overpriced.\\r\\nThis is a wonderful eye cream that helps with dry, crepey under eyes. It helps with fine lines as it plumps and brightens the skin having hyaluronic acid being the main ingredient. It\\'s also a great eye cream to start early with, in your mid twenties, to keep your under eyes looking young and delaying the development of fine lines.\\r\\nLeaves my under eyes looking so hydrated! I love the packing and the scent. Would definitely recommend for those under bag eyes.\\r\\nI received this in my influenster box and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been trying it. Is very easily absorbed with lightweight.\\r\\nThis is a good basic cooling eye gel/ cream. The cooling affect that you get with this eye is great and I enjoy. Although I do feel like you can run out of this fast because it is so light that you might need more product. Overall it is a good eye cream if you want to splurge.\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nI\\'ve used better and worse eye creams before.I don\\'t enjoy that the consistency is so firm. The viscosity is so high that you really have to pull on the eye to warm it up and move it around. If you intend to warm it up between your ring fingers you\\'ll find a lot of it being absorbed into your fingertips.\\xc2\\xa0I also find that I have to use a lot of product compared to some of my other staples like the Eminence Neroli Eye Serum. I do enjoy it more than most if not all drug store eye creams I\\'ve tried before. It does leave my eyes feeling moisturized afterwards which is it\\'s initial intention and purpose.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nWow this eye bomb product is so moisturizing. I just had a sample, but I loved it and would buy again. Highly recommend.\\r\\nI am so close to giving this product 5 stars. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a bit heavy, so I typically use it at night and have no issue at all. I feel like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a bit pricey but overall a great product and makes the skin under eyes feel so hydrated!\\r\\nI used this eye cream as part of my daily morning regimen. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightweight enough that the skin around my eyes absorbed it quickly and left the area feeling soft and hydrated. A little bit goes a long way, so a small amount dabbed around the eye area is plenty. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see a huge improvement with fine lines but the area certainly felt nice and hydrated. For night time I prefer a thicker cream.\\r\\nI got this product as a free sample and received the 0.17 fl oz. size. This is my first under eye product and I didn\\'t see much difference to be honest. First uses felt great, refreshing and lightweight. It helped with puffiness under my eyes, but not so much with fine lines. However, I don\\'t feel it\\'s a game changer in my skin routine. I would recommend to use it before makeup in order to protect the light under eye skin, but the 0.17 size. I\\'ve been using it for a month and because it absorbs quickly I only need to use a little bit of cream every time.\\r\\nVery moisturizering and hydrated. I like to use it after I wash my face or before bed. Does make make tired eyes feel a lot better. Also did notice a slight difference in my dark circles when I was using it, the reason I stopped was because I\\'m trying to take care of my acne but when I remember to put it on it does feel refreshing.\\r\\nI got a sa.pme of this and its amazing I had to buy full size. This is so nice and absorbing. I use at night and the morning makes my skin feel amazing\\r\\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it consistently enough to see results, but i liked the product. my under eyes are very sensitive and usually break out in hives from under eye creams but this one has never caused any problems for me. highly recommend for other people with sensitive skin\\r\\nThis was just meh.  It moisturized, but not much, so this is probably better for those that have greasier undereye areas.  It felt good and sunk in quickly, which I really appreciated.  It\\'s not bad, it\\'s just that for the price, it didn\\'t really live up to the hype.  I think you could get much cheaper eye moisturizers that work just as well.\\r\\nThis eye cream is awesome and for the price I highly recommend this item! It hydrates well and lasts all day.\\r\\nI love this stuff! I honestly used it all over instead of just under my eyes & it made my skin so hydrated & soft feeling & it lasted all day! A little goes a long way & it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t oily, it soaked into my skin perfectly!\\r\\nThis was a gel based cream and had some fragrance to it. I did not see any dramatic results to my under eye area but it did moisturize. Not something I would run out and buy.\\r\\nI really like this eye cream, especially to wake me up in the morning and decrease puffiness. I have very sensitive skin and this product did not irritate it at all. Unfortunately, if I use my laroche posay moisturizer under this eye cream, it pills up. But, no other combination of a moisturizer has done the same thing. I use it in the morning and the night and has helped the psoriasis on my eyelids!\\r\\nThis was fine, it\\'s kind of a generic moisturizing eye cream. I felt like it worked fine and you need so little that the container lasts forever. Kept my eye area moisturized but I don\\'t know that it specifically made any difference beyond that.\\r\\nVery good for fine lines and dry skin. I use at night and help me a lot when i use the concealer\\r\\nAmazing texture! Really refreshing and calming to the under eye. It does the job hydrating but I need to use a lot to mantain my fine lines filled. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very basic but must have!!\\r\\nEste producto me lleg\\xc3\\xb3 en una de las suscripciones de Sephora, y pens\\xc3\\xa9 que daba resultados hasta que lo prob\\xc3\\xa9, me he quedado encantada, enamorada y obsesionada con este producto, sinceramente lo volver\\xc3\\xada a comprar si tuviese el dinero aunque sea un poco costoso.\\r\\nMeh. For me it was a flop. I have under eye bags and dark circles.. and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t helped + I had allergy. Felt itching.. Tried it for a few times and every single of them was the same\\r\\nVery moisturizing. I prefer to use this at night, as it is richer and takes longer to absorb.\\r\\nLove this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating and I love the formula and consistency of it. It makes my under eyes feel super hydrated.\\r\\nI think this eye moisturizer is just ok! I do think it could be soothing if your under-eye area is uncomfortable or dry. For me it hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really done much of anything. I will continue to use it but I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t repurchase.\\r\\nIt works like magic. Moisturizes my eye lids very much! Excellent product! Thankyou for sending it to me for Free!\\r\\nThis eye cream is such a dream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s such a lightweight texture and it leaves the skin underneath my eyes unbelievably happy. I love bringing it with me whenever I travel and have to take a flight because the air in the plane makes my skin so so so dry. All in all, it gets the job done and does exactly what I want an eye cream to do. That being said, I know that eye creams can be pricey and this one is expensive as well. However, you only need the smallest amount every time and a jar will easily last several months for me.\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect for moisturizing the under eye area and has no scent which I love. Only downside is it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty pricey.\\r\\nThis is a very nice gel like eye cream.\\xef\\xbf\\xbc you get a soothing, cooling sensation when you apply it. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really notice any changes under my eyes. However it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a nice product when you need a little extra hydration or cooling under your eyes. \\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nI normally use this product as a part of my skincare routine before bed. Especially since it goes around your eyes I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really glad that there is no fragrance in this product. It is moisturizing and absorbs well without being greasy. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t currently struggle with a lot of lines under my eyes, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to me to judge it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affect on those, so for now I use this as a preventative measure and just to try to take good care of my skin! I received this product complimentary for review from Influenster.\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb Amazing! Love to use this at night it just hydrates my under eyes. Not greasy. I love it.\\r\\nWhile I love the thin/watery consistency of this eye cream, I have found that if I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use the tiniest (and I mean TINIEST) amount, it will begin to cause milia underneath my eyes and that hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happened to me in the past with other eye creams.\\r\\nThis is the belif moisturizing eye bomb that helps hydrate underneath your eyes! Use every 26 hours\\r\\nHydrating eye cream with a pleasing gel/ creamy texture that sinks in quickly. I apply it in the morning and at night, and it feels refreshing. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still young (23), so my main goal is to hydrate the skin and preserve the elasticity and thickness of the skin around my eyes. This product does just that!\\r\\nThis stuff is amazing! I had been suffering from dry, flaky skin underneath my eyes, and I bought a hydration set from Sephora for $23. A mini of this was included. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it for a few days now, and my eyes look so much better! The dryness is almost gone completely and I am no longer waking up with red puffy eyes! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so glad I bought this! It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t burn when applying, either!\\r\\nVery moisturizing. I love the minty feel when you apply it under your eyes. I religiously used this for over a month as it was gifted to me. Helped with the overall hydration I was lacking. Great product!\\r\\nThis eye cream is nice and extremely hydrating under the eyes. However I would only recommend using it at night because it would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cball up\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sometimes on my skin so I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to put my makeup over it during the day. I think it is worth trying out but I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t repurchase.\\r\\nLightweight but hydrating. Sinks in. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make my makeup pill on top. Really nice. It feels cooling on the skin to me as well!\\r\\nI\\'ve never bought a full size of this product, but I\\'ve had sample sizes from the Sephora point system and every time this is available I always get 5 because of how moisturizing and small it is. I\\'ve never bought the full size because I still have eye cream at home.\\r\\nReally enjoy this product at night. Definitely very hydrating for the under eyes. Makes me look fresh and rested in the morning.\\r\\nWorked well. No complaints. Very hydrating. Compared to neutrogena hydro boost. Very hydrating and water based.\\r\\nI received this product in my vox box and am in love with it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be purchasing this all year long. I actually use it in the morning and at night. Its so hydrating which is amazing for my dry skin. I feels so smooth and cool going on. Highly recommend!\\r\\nThis product is ok. It moisturizes my under eyes but no more than a regular moisturizer would. Might work better for someone else with really dry under eyes.\\r\\nSuper basic eye cream. Hydrating, but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see almost any results. Does the trick if you just want something to moisturize the area.\\r\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really see how it has great ratings. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely moisturizing but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about it, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything special.\\r\\nI have received a few deluxe samples of this, and I\\'m always happy to get it in my beauty subscriptions. It really is a hydrating bomb! My skin drinks it right up & feels/looks plump and youthful.\\r\\nThis eye cream feels amazing and is very moisturizing however the smell is horrible. But that just my opinion\\r\\nThis eye cream is the only one I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried that really reduces puffiness under my eyes. I do have a few skin lines running under my eyelids and this cream will firm them up and make them less noticeable. The only reason I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t repurchased is the price is a bit too high. The end of the cream in the tub can get dried out quickly too, making it hard to use up\\r\\nThis eye cream is honestly the best I have ever used. I will be continuing to buy this!! It has a cool smell that feels very natural. It also leaves my eyes feeling super moisturized and just looking lovely.\\r\\nI use this daily and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say enough about it. Smoothed my dry under eyes to allow my makeup to glide on. It feels great after a long day.\\r\\nI often forget about eye cream, but I have this one and I like it! It feels very moisturizing. Just make sure not to get it too close to your eyes or else they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll start watering\\r\\nIt leaves a soothing feeling on your skin. It fulfills it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purpose as a moisturizer.\\r\\nI really enjoy this product. I received a sample recently and I can tell it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing something after just a few uses. It tingles and I wake up without poofy eyes when I use it at night.\\r\\nDoesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything special but super gentle and moisturizing. I do really like it, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not my holy grail.\\r\\nthis product is very nice It is very good for the eyes not help me did use my dark circles and other eye problem or impurities and repeated use this product it is amazing\\r\\nNew fav eye moisturizer! Super lightweight and hydrating. Effective. Good for those hangover eyes\\r\\nI truly love this eye cream. It is perfect for the dry winter months. It kept my eye moist and soft. Would I buy again> yes. In the winter\\r\\nVery moisturizing. The container will last you forever considering a little goes a long way. Thinner texture but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t interfere with my makeup application\\r\\nThis eye bomb was a complete surprise. It improve my eye area greatly and absorb easily!\\r\\nWhile I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think an eye cream is necessary in a skin care routine, this one is nice. It is very hydrating but lightweight. It has a pleasant spa like smell. I feel that this product is so similar to their regular moisture bomb moisturizer for the face, so if you have that one you could probably just use it under the eyes as well.\\r\\nDeseo probar esta marca y sus productos para poder recomendarlo y seguir us\\xc3\\xa1ndolo\\r\\nEsta crema me encanta , lo uso en mi rutina de noche y me ha ayudado muchisimo a controlar esas arrugas en los ojos vale la pena el precio\\r\\nI use this every night. Even when I sometimes switch up eye creams, I feel like I always go back to this one. Just wish it would help more with dark circles.\\r\\nI love this I cream, it is super hydrating and has such good, clean ingredients.  I like keeping it in the refrigerator and dabbing a bit on in the morning to help wake me up and give me those bright eyes!\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nI tend to opt for eye serums instead of moisturizers because my eye area is very sensitive and I usually end up developing milia. However this eye bomb is somewhere in between in the sweet spot and works wonderfully.\\r\\nTHE BEST EYE CREAM! Belif is such an underrated brand- all of their products are top notch!\\r\\nMy favorite eye cream especially during the winter time. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incredibly hydrating but not in a greasy way. It blends in so well and sits nicely on the eye. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make concealer crease at all either. I love using this with the Belif aqua bomb for some all around extra hydration.\\r\\nI just recently started using a sample of this eye cream and I am liking it so far! Still too soon to tell if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minimizing lines/wrinkles but if anything my under eyes are looking more hydrated when I wake up in the morning!\\r\\nReally nice eye cream, feels refreshing and cooling on my skin and it feels good after a long day. I like the scent and the consistency.\\r\\noneeeeee offf theeeeee besttttttt productsssss in townnnnn, seriouslyyyyyyyy, try ittttt and buy itttttttt, recommendddddddd 100%%%%%%%%, a gooddddddd productttttttttttttt, you will not regret buying itttttt. the product is super...\\r\\nThis is like the true cream for your eyes. Love the light gel texture and the way my eyes feel moisturized after use.\\r\\nVery moisturizing. I spread this from my eyes around my face to preserve some moisture before my regular moisturizer. I also like the way it smells and how light and easy it is to spread around. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel heavy or too watery. I recommend it to dry skinned people.\\r\\nThis is my 2nd favorite eye product behind murad. It feels almost like a jelly, smooths on super easy. Feels very nice on the eyes and is effective. It lessens my under eye bags and helps with crows feet.\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think eye cream is that important in skin care but this eye cream definitely improved the texture under my eyes. It was light and non greasy.\\r\\nI have dark circles under my eyes. I used this product with my evening routine and noticed a big difference the next morning. It made the dark circles brighter and not as noticeable. The skin was so soft and fine lines were less noticeable. I recommend this product and am anxious to try other products from this company.\\r\\nI got this product in a set but I love it I have gone back to buy a full sized one and it is super moisturizing and good with sensitive skin\\r\\nI was always a huge fan of Belif. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using their products since high school and I knew this product was not going to disappoint! I apply this under my eyes morning and night and it quickly absorbs into my skin leaving my under eyes looking awake and moisturized!\\r\\nGot this in my last influenster box and i absolutely love it!! It is pricey but a little goes such a long way so i\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely worth it\\r\\nI\\'ve been using this for a few weeks since I received it in the Spring into Summer VoxBox and I\\'m honestly underwhelmed. I\\'ve heard great things about this moisturizer so I was so excited to try it. I love the gel texture since it sinks into your skin, but was put off by the scent. I have sensitive skin so I try to steer from scented products and this one smells a bit like eucalyptus. Since using it, I haven\\'t seen much of a difference in my under eyes. I will continue to use the sample, but probably wouldn\\'t repurchase. \\r\\nI got a sample of this and it was only okay. What I expect from an eye cream is brighter eyes, supple skin, and depuffing but this just fell short of what I was looking for.\\r\\nGot this as a sample and have been using it in small amounts because I really like it and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford the full sized version lol. Nice and creamy texture, no discernible smell. Feels good on the sensitive eye skin.\\r\\nI am very careful with facial products because my skin is very sensitive.  I decided to test this product that I received by VoxBox Influencer and I am very satisfied.  My eye region is very dry and I have dark circles under my eyes.  My first impression was how effective the product is for hydration, in the first days of use I already felt a big difference.  After two weeks of using it every day and night, I could see a slight improvement in dark circles as well.  I had no allergic reaction.\\r\\nNoticiable hydration since the first use, I recommend to even leave it on over night or during long flights!\\r\\nKeeps eyes very hydrated. Not sure if it does anything for wrinkles. But after hours of use, I still feel the hydration under my eyes\\r\\nJust started trying out this product recently and am really liking how it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s making my under eyes feel. Very cool and refreshing. Would recommend it to anyone who would like to try it. Of course like always before buying the original, I would buy the travel size and try it out.\\r\\nAmazing product\\xe2\\x80\\x99 love the texture. The gel to water consistency works wonders and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make you feel like you are tugging on the delicate eye skin. I normally have dry skin around my eyes but this product really keep my eyes bright and moisturized!\\r\\nMakes my under eyes feel great, used it for a couple of weeks because I got it as a tester, it is oil free and fragrance free.\\r\\nMe envanta, super bueno para los ojos , perfecto te hidrata, y te deja un brillo unico\\r\\nI really love this product! I use it in the mornings as a primer for makeup because my under eyes can get dry - keeps them moisturized throughout the day!\\r\\nThis is good stuff. I\\'m not sure I saw any immediate benefit but I don\\'t really expect immediate results. This is stiffer than most eye creams and I like that. Keeps hydrating throughout the day. No real scent to it either. Just a good all-day product.\\r\\nGot this as a sample and have been using it in small amounts because I really like it and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford the full sized version lol.

A little bit goes a very long way!\\r\\nAmazing eye cream! I could be on 3 hours sleep but I throw this on and I look like I slept like a baby! Only downside is that it is in a pot and there would always be fuzz and stuff on the edge that would gross me out.\\r\\nI received this as a gift in my voxbox and it is now my holy grail! It makes my under eyes so hydrated and makes concealer last all day and not crease on me. I use this at night too and even into the next day my eyes are moisturized\\r\\nMoisturizes your under eyes like crazy. I apply it once a day before I go to bed and it still feels moisturized und the morning.\\r\\nSuper rich and creamy!  It definitely hydrates the skin around my eyes (and lips because I use it there too) and helps to keep fine lines at bay.  I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it will reverse any fine lines in the long term but it does minimize the appearance of them.\\r\\nI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really use eye. team prior to this but was pleasantly surprised! I get very dry eyelids and after one night of using this they were smooth and hydrated! My under eyes also looked less exhausted! Highly recommend\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Moisturizing, cooling, and sinks in fast. I love it! Would buy over and over. Lasts a long time too.\\r\\nI use this day and night. It keeps under eyes moisturized throughout the night and wears well under makeup\\r\\nI enjoy this cream. Gentle, no hard fragrance. Does moisturizer the under eye well. Sinks into the skin quickly and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave it sticky\\r\\nThis product is amazing!! My eyes tear up a lot so my eyes get dry around them and this product works so well!! I love this because it really does moisturize very well and it is very good because your eyes are a very sensitive area and this eye cream doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bother my sensitive skin!\\r\\nWell I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried this product before I received it for complementary purposes on #springintosummervoxbox . This would leave my eyes feeling so moisturized, I put this on overnight and in the morning my under eyes are so moisturized and supple\\r\\nExpensive but worth every penny! I originally received a sample of this and knew right away I would buy the full size. Moisturizes and diminishes the fine lines around my eyes. This moisturizer helps concealer go on way smoother without caking too.\\r\\nI love this! Specially if left in the fridge. It feels so hydrating and good! Would 100% recommend\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a busy college study with staying up late and getting assignments done (due to full-time schedule) and this product is a great refresher whenever my eyes feel tired. Also, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a part of my morning and night skincare routine.\\r\\nA soothing eye cream. Not too heavy. Goes on easy and you will see results within a few days.\\r\\nWow, this is the best eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extremely moisturizing and helps reduce the appearance of my fine lines. I use it twice a day and notice a difference when I wake up in the morning; my under-eye area is much brighter and healthier looking! Give this one a try\\r\\nI got the sample version in the Spring into Summer VoxBox and LOVE it. A little goes a long way. It cooled and soothed my under-eyes with just one use. I feel like it got rid of any puffiness, darkness and fine lines that I had. It is a bit pricey, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d definitely invest and purchase it\\r\\n\\xe2\\x84\\x9a\\xf0\\x9d\\x95\\xa6\\xf0\\x9d\\x95\\x92\\xf0\\x9d\\x95\\x9d\\xf0\\x9d\\x95\\x9a\\xf0\\x9d\\x95\\xa5\\xf0\\x9d\\x95\\xaa:  Great quality!

It is super hydrating and a decent price and value in my opinion. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice a ton of wrinkle reduction but it helps plump and hydrate for me! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also just in my 20s.\\r\\nThis eye moisturizer goes a long way, goes on smooth and has great ingredients! Hopeful that the squalane, glycerin, ceramides, & willow bark will soothe, moisturize and improve my skin!\\r\\nLove this stuff! I use it nightly and my eyes feel more hydrated and ready to work the next day. It may be expensive but this eye cream helps with elasticity. The only thing I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d improve is adding something to help dark circles :)\\r\\nHonestamente una de las mejores f\\xc3\\xb3rmulas que he probado para crema de ojos, es muy buena ligera no es grasosa y sientes c\\xc3\\xb3mo act\\xc3\\xbaa de inmediato. Vale mucho la pena porque con un poco de producto cubres una gran \\xc3\\xa1rea y eso es muy importante !me encanto\\r\\nI like this product! I feel that it absorbs into the skin and does leave the eyes moisturized and glowy. It applies very easily and a little goes a long way. I believe it is intended for fine lines/wrinkles which i do not have any of currently, so I am unsure how it will benefit those that do or if it is truly worth the money at that price point. I do feel that the moisturizing qualities will definitely help in the prevention of them though. I would recommend.\\r\\nThis is seriously the best eye cream. It doesn\\'t dry out my eyes like a lot of the eye creams I\\'ve used in the past. It is expensive but a little goes a really long way. It lasts a long time and smells good!\\r\\nI love love love this stuff. I got it in my ipsy bag and i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be DEVASTATED when i run out of my trial size.  It hydrates my undereyes unbelievably well which makes my dark circles look less dark. 11/10 recommend\\r\\nLove this product! It makes my undereye area feel so awake and moisturized without being overly greasy!\\r\\nThis eye cream I just can get enough of it, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for my under eyes it leaves the area refresh it does not irritated nor leaves it filling tight. It just the perfect eye cream believe me you are going to love it\\r\\nI wanted to love this, but I feel like it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really doing much for my circles. It feels great on the skin, but I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed much.\\r\\nI love this!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thick, and I really do feel like it made my eye are less wrinkly. I got mine as part of a belif gift set from Sephora at Christmas time. I got a discount too since their VIB sale was going on at the time.\\r\\nSoy fan de la marca desde 2014 y nunca me decepciona, tengo piel grasa incluso en el area de los ojos, est\\xc3\\xa1 crema me viene perfecto, se siente fresca al ponerse, es muy ligera pero humecta lo suficiente, no deja grasosa el area.\\r\\nI received this product complimentary but I like it. I put it on before bed and it had helped brighten my under eye area. A little bit goes a very long way!\\r\\nAmazing eye cream! I could be on 3 hours sleep but I throw this on and I look like I slept like a baby! Only downside is that it is in a pot and there would always be fuzz and stuff on the edge that would gross me out.\\r\\nI received this as a gift in my voxbox and it is now my holy grail! It makes my under eyes so hydrated and makes concealer last all day and not crease on me. I use this at night too and even into the next day my eyes are moisturized\\r\\nMoisturizes your under eyes like crazy. I apply it once a day before I go to bed and it still feels moisturized und the morning.\\r\\nSuper rich and creamy!  It definitely hydrates the skin around my eyes (and lips because I use it there too) and helps to keep fine lines at bay.  I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it will reverse any fine lines in the long term but it does minimize the appearance of them.\\r\\nI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really use eye. team prior to this but was pleasantly surprised! I get very dry eyelids and after one night of using this they were smooth and hydrated! My under eyes also looked less exhausted! Highly recommend\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Moisturizing, cooling, and sinks in fast. I love it! Would buy over and over. Lasts a long time too.\\r\\nI use this day and night. It keeps under eyes moisturized throughout the night and wears well under makeup\\r\\nI enjoy this cream. Gentle, no hard fragrance. Does moisturizer the under eye well. Sinks into the skin quickly and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave it sticky\\r\\nThis product is amazing!! My eyes tear up a lot so my eyes get dry around them and this product works so well!! I love this because it really does moisturize very well and it is very good because your eyes are a very sensitive area and this eye cream doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bother my sensitive skin!\\r\\nWell I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried this product before I received it for complementary purposes on #springintosummervoxbox . This would leave my eyes feeling so moisturized, I put this on overnight and in the morning my under eyes are so moisturized and supple\\r\\nExpensive but worth every penny! I originally received a sample of this and knew right away I would buy the full size. Moisturizes and diminishes the fine lines around my eyes. This moisturizer helps concealer go on way smoother without caking too.\\r\\nI love this! Specially if left in the fridge. It feels so hydrating and good! Would 100% recommend\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a busy college study with staying up late and getting assignments done (due to full-time schedule) and this product is a great refresher whenever my eyes feel tired. Also, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a part of my morning and night skincare routine.\\r\\nA soothing eye cream. Not too heavy. Goes on easy and you will see results within a few days.\\r\\nWow, this is the best eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extremely moisturizing and helps reduce the appearance of my fine lines. I use it twice a day and notice a difference when I wake up in the morning; my under-eye area is much brighter and healthier looking! Give this one a try\\r\\nI got the sample version in the Spring into Summer VoxBox and LOVE it. A little goes a long way. It cooled and soothed my under-eyes with just one use. I feel like it got rid of any puffiness, darkness and fine lines that I had. It is a bit pricey, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d definitely invest and purchase it\\r\\n\\xe2\\x84\\x9a\\xf0\\x9d\\x95\\xa6\\xf0\\x9d\\x95\\x92\\xf0\\x9d\\x95\\x9d\\xf0\\x9d\\x95\\x9a\\xf0\\x9d\\x95\\xa5\\xf0\\x9d\\x95\\xaa:  Great quality!

It is super hydrating and a decent price and value in my opinion. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice a ton of wrinkle reduction but it helps plump and hydrate for me! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also just in my 20s.\\r\\nThis eye moisturizer goes a long way, goes on smooth and has great ingredients! Hopeful that the squalane, glycerin, ceramides, & willow bark will soothe, moisturize and improve my skin!\\r\\nI love and highly recommend this product! In my opinion it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the perfect  moisturizer\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\xef\\xbf\\xbc/bomb for your eyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too heavy feeling If you know what I mean. My eyes feel moisturized and smooth after every use. \\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nI am obsessed with this product. I use it every night before bed and I think it has definitely improved my under eye area.\\r\\nI found this product to just be ok it was nothing too special but it did hydrate my under eyes. I found that I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need a lot to put on both eyes but it did not last of the day and my under eyes are a bit dry by the end of the day.\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nI have been very pleased with this eye cream. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel heavy, but still feels very moisturizing. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a fan.\\r\\nI love it, \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x9e\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8fit is my favorite product, \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x9e\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8fi can not without it \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x9a\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x9ei use it everyday \\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\r\\nI love love love this eye cream! Not only is it very gentle and cooling, it brightens your eyes and leaves them very soft.\\r\\nMy under eye gets really dry and so far this has been my favorite eye cream to use at night. Very moisturizing!\\r\\nThat\\'s it helps make my dark eyes a lot better it definitely unpuffs my face and makes it feel nice and fresh and his great after skincare routine.\\r\\nVery lightweight and feels nice and cooling when applying. I do see some improvement in hydration almost immediately. And definitely a bit more after using for almost a week. Makes a huge difference in makeup application.\\r\\nI love this paired with the aqua bomb moisturizer. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thin but effective, makes my fine lines less noticeable and leaves my under eyes looking more hydrated. This is the only eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used up and repurchased, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll continue to!\\r\\nThis eye bomb cream is amazing. Scent is amazing and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super gentle for your delicate eye skin. So important to use an eye cream as opposed to just Lathering on a regular face cream on your eye lids and creases. This stuff is amazing\\r\\nLike a moisture bomb for your eyes. A little goes a long way here. I use nightly and am very impressed with the results.\\r\\nI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help but say this product is Bomb! Yep, couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help myself. Ur feels super hydrating and the consistency is thick and creamy so it feels extra luxurious as you apply. It disappears into your skin almost instantly. Love this!\\r\\nEye creams are not necessary but I do like to have an extra shine and vibrancy under my eyes. This product is very light and has like a cooling effect leaves my skin under my eyes hydrated!\\r\\nReceived this as a free sample from the Influenster spring into summer vox box which was amazing. Love this eye cream and would have never picked it up on my own. Not greasy but very moisturizing and makes dark circles much less noticeable for me.\\r\\nI got this in my VoxBox and have really enjoyed it! I use it daily and I feel as if my skin around my eyes have become more hydrated and fine lines have softened a bit! Really blends into your skin nicely, no heavy feeling!\\r\\nGot this in my recent voxbox and it is really impressive and hydrating. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the first time I had ever used it and is overall a great product; I just typically like having something that helps with my dark circles which is why I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars. Still love the product!\\r\\nThis is a great eye cream for added hydration. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super moisturizing yet not too heavy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more of a gel texture rather than cream which is great for the under eye area as heavy creams often cause malia for me.\\r\\nWish it was more cooling and better for puffy eyes but pretty good for dark circles smells nice\\r\\nI used to absolutely love this. I have very dry skin so I would apply this to stop my skin from flaking. Unfortunately, I developed a reaction to this product severe enough to require medical attention, and thus would not try this again.\\r\\nI love this eye bomb i use every morning to make me look more awake very very effective! I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change a think about this product its not too pricey i would most definitely recommend\\r\\nI love this eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice gel texture so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too heavy for summer but is enough to keep your eyes moisturized during winter. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pricey but it lasts a long time. Would definitely buy again.\\r\\nI like this eye cream! It is soft and subtle. I like the way it applies, you only need a little drop to cover the whole eye area. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice a huge change in appearance so at this moment I am not sure I would repurchase. However, I will continue to use it longer to see if I notice any long term effects.\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how much this actually makes a difference but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so cooling and refreshing to put on so I use it anyway\\r\\nMy FAVORITE Eye cream ever! I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe when it says in 26 hours everything will be gone until I used at night and when I woke up my eye game changed! This gives to fast results and better eye cream then anyone! I also loveee the packaging!\\r\\nExtremely moisturizing eye bomb that I use every morning. It is extremely gentle on the skin and it smells hydrating. It feels like an essential water based moisturizer.\\r\\nLove it! So hydrating. I have several minis of this and the formula and texture is heavenly!\\r\\nThis does a great job at keeping my under eyes moisturized but i wish it didnt have fragrance in it with my sensitive skin.\\r\\nI love how hydrating this makes my eyes look. It makes my eyes look full and not sunken and tired looking. It doesn\\'t irritate my eye bags and also doesn\\'t move while I\\'m sleeping. I would consider this average priced for an eye cream. Maybe it could have less fragrance in it for people with more sensitive skin?\\r\\nEye bomb is the bomb! Lightweight refreshing and oh so hydrating. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m loving how refreshed my eyes look after use. Not fragranced. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a true Belif-er for life now! Definitely recommend trying it for yourself.\\r\\nI liked how hydrating this eye cream is. To be completely honest I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never tried an eye cream that was life changing, or tried one that I hated. This is the same. I like trying different eye creams so I usually rotate but may purchase this again.\\r\\nEsta mascarilla para ojos me ha ayudado a desinflamar mis ojeras y darle un aspecto m\\xc3\\xa1s sano a mis ojos..\\r\\nThis is the best eye cream EVER!!! I traded it for Fresh. And I LOVE Fresh!!!! I thought I would never switch but then I sampled this one and omg . I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find another that makes me feel so good. I highly recommend.\\r\\nI love this eye cream! Not too thick or sticky. I use it mostly at night especially after a long shift and I wake up feeling super refreshed. No eye bags in sight!\\r\\nThis eye cream is so moisturizing, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insane. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s balmy texture helps seal the moisture in all night or day long. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the cheapest eye cream out there, but a little goes a long way so the jar will last you. This is a must have!\\r\\nI absolutely LOVE this eye cream, it does everyrhing it claims. As soon as you apply it you instantly feep hydrated, it\\'s not sticky at all and wear great with any concealer. I would most definitely recommend this to anyone who\\'s searching for a great eye cream.\\r\\nmuy buen producto muy buena cumple total divino me gusta mucho la marca son muy lindos lo comprar\\xc3\\xada siempre\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nExelente producto, a cumplido todas mis expectativas. Espero puedan comprarlo todas es espectacular\\r\\nthis is one of the lightest weight eye creams on the market. so refreshing and not sticky at all - great stuff\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really wear eye creams, but Influenster sent me a sample to try. This isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t very heavy or fragranced. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t greasy, instead it dries like water. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed any milia as a result of using this. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m only rating it 4 stars because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any comparison for this type of product, but I have found this to be very hydrating.\\r\\nOne of my favorite eye creams, especially for when my undereyes need a little extra hydration.  Smooth texture applies comfortably without feeling heavy on undereye skin and keeps undereyes from looking or feeling dry!  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this for months (I bought it w my own money before receiving the sample) and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still my go-to\\r\\nVery lush, creamy moisturizing cream. I used this over a few months and did notice my eyes were much more moisturized. The reason I only gave it three starts is because it is very scented. In the past, scents have not bothered me but this was very strong and I think I may have had a slight reaction to it. I\\'m not sure if the moisturizing effects of the cream left my eyes puffy or it was a reaction from my body not liking the scent. Overall though, if you like a rich eye cream and don\\'t mind scents in skincare - give it a try. I would recommend: especially in winter or dry environments with low humidity.\\r\\nI like it. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a really great day moisturizing eye cream. I love the way it feels and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydrating for the under eyes.  I love the way it smells and it feels great, all you need is a little bit and it will last a long time! I think this is a great eye cream on the hydrating side- not so sure how it is for wrinkles as it is described. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel or see a difference with wrinkles so at night, I would go for a retinol based eye creams if you are looking for that. Love it for the hydration though!\\r\\nIt is such a great eye cream! One of my favorites. It feels so nice and makes my under eyes look and feel smooth!\\r\\nBy far my favorite eye cream! Extremely moisturizing and light. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clogging my pours and my eyes look brighter just after a few uses. I apply it to this around my eyes and even on the lines of my smile. Will be repurchasing!\\r\\nI love this product!! Usually eye creams leave texture on my face but this one is so lightweight it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t clog your pores, or atleast it hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t with me! All the tiny bumps are gone and my under eye is so hydrated!\\r\\nOkay, call me crazy but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this on my whole face for the past week and it has changed my skin texture. (I heard Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s makeup artist uses eye cream on the whole face so I had to try it). My pores are tighter, I feel like my skin looks younger and so fresh, and the product is so satisfying to apply- light, soaks in well, and smells great. 10/10\\r\\nGot this as a sample and I love it!!!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super light weight and actually hydrated your under eyes!!! I love it and I will purchase it!! I will highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good eye moisturizer.\\r\\nThis eye boy is great it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really helpful I recommend this for anyone skin care comes first lol\\r\\nI received this product complimentary for testing purposes through my voxbox. Since I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve received this product i used it a multiple times over the past  2 weeks. I LOVE THIS PRODUCt!!!!!  I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how much i needed this product until i tried it. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to continue using it even after my samples runs out!!! #belifinhydration #springintosummervoxbox\\r\\nI received this complimentary from Influenster to try out. Honestly, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not really into eye creams because I feel like a lot of them feel either heavy or leave a sticky residue, but this one doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super light weight and gets absorbed into your skin and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave a residue on your skin which I really liked. It is hydrating and moisturizing.\\r\\nI received this as a complimentary item from influenster. This is a lightweight yet moisturizing eye cream. It is a bit pricey but has helped me soooo much with my dark circles and i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not big on eye creams but this is a game changer! I rate it a 4 because i think its pricey compared to other eye creams but other than that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth it!\\r\\nThis is the best eye cream ever! It hydrates and smooths my undereye. It feels so good at night.\\r\\nReceived this product free. Feels soft and nice under my eyes. I like it overall!!!!\\r\\nSo hydrating and cooling. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t burn or irritate my eyes at all and I wake up looking refreshed\\r\\nI think this eye cream was alright. It is lightweight but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see a difference on me.\\r\\nI just received this product from Influenster and I have been using it for 2 days now so I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really do a review just yet! BUT I love that you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to really use much and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so moist! I would buy if my results turn out good!\\r\\nI want to say this is totally awesome and definitely works!! It definitely met my expectations and I felt very refreshed my eyes definitely appreciated the refresh as well. I received this as a sample and looking to purchasing a full size bottle!\\r\\nThis eye cream is lovely! It\\'s hydrating and beneficial for the under eye areas. It seems thick at first, but it does spread nicely. The packaging is amazing and it\\'s gentle. It didn\\'t feel harsh at all. I can recommend this to others since I\\'m quite impressed.\\r\\nEs uno de mis contornos favoritos, tiene una textura especial. Hidrata perfectamente y sobre todo no deja exceso de producto. \\r\\nThis eye cream is very light, and like a gel texture. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it everyday, i did every other day.   I was scared to try it because people said it gave them white bumps under their eyes, but that didn\\'t happen for me. I used small amounts.  I would give it a try.\\r\\nProducto de buena calidad y buen estado es perfecto para todo tipo de piel super lindo para cuidado de la piel \\r\\nI saw a great difference in my dark circles after using this product. It is very effective and I was told that it increases blood circulation around the eyes, which is good. I wanted to refill on this product but it was sold out at Sephora. Waiting for them to restock!\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really good omg I can see the work it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done for my dark circles and it really works. I also really love how good it smells. Another thing is that a little goes a long way with this product but I do really enjoy it.\\r\\nGood eye cream but less efficacy than I expected. It is a cream but I did not realized great changement after some weeks. I think maybe adds some vitamins or other collageneous components could improve it. I used the other products from the same line, and I liked more. \\r\\nMe gustar\\xc3\\xada probarlo, ya que tiene muy buenos comentarios, pero \\xc2\\xbfsirve para las personas que tenemos piel grasa? \\r\\nLove this, I use it along with the full face moisturizer. I put it not only under my eyes but around my mouth where my skin is extra thin and sensitive as well. As a 26 year old Im doing my best to prevent any more fine lines and wrinkles, hoping to age gracefully and naturally into my thirties.\\r\\nI love this Product !!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s such a gentle moisturizer on your eye and it leaves it smooth and soft. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t touch a think on this product, I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect. I would buy it again. Most definitely!!!\\r\\n\"I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\"  I use this product for 6 months and I have a lot of dark circles and this product help me to dissapear that problem. I love belif products and moisturizing eye bomb is a must!!!!\\r\\nThe consistency of this product is amazing it is unlike other eye creams I have tried! It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel greasy and is very hydrating. I have dry under eyes but not after putting on this eye cream and is very gentle. I would recommend to others!\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nThis is creamy and cooling. I feel more of a brightening and firmness even around my eyes after using.\\r\\nThis is a great hydrating when cream ! This is my first time using it, and I like. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very moist and absorbs onto the eye area very nicely. I use it at night after applying retional to hydrate my under eyes. The price for an eye cream is very high. But if you really need an eye moisturizer, this is good\\r\\nVery hydrating and de-puffs the under eye area. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help much with my dark circles though.\\r\\nI have tried a lot of eye creams and can say that this is the best! worth the price. Very nice texture and moisturizing factors. Nice packaging. Perfect for first \"adult\" eye cream (after 23), for first lines.\\r\\nThis is super moisturizing but i only use it when i gey eczema around my eyes - it definitely does what the description says but i really need more from an eye cream than just hydratoon\\r\\nOne product I never skip before makeup and before bed!

Within a month of consistent use, my eyes looked SO much brighter and felt great. The hype is so real!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nWow! Just wow! This eye cream is amazing and helps me get rid of my dark and puffy bags because of my long study hours and work! I recommend it to anyone!\\r\\ni love any type of moisturizing cream and my face is always very dry. i put this on and it was very nice it did sting a bit but i think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bc i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sunburnt there. the smell is very nice as well.\\r\\nI personally got the travel size one because I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if it would be this good but it It is amazing it makes your dark circles go right away and this is my new essential pick up my make up bag\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nI kid you not, when you apply this your  under eye skin feels like silk. The tiniest amount goes the longest way which makes this purchase well worth it. It leaves my under eye moisturized all day! This should be a must in your skin care.\\r\\nThe only eye cream I will use. It brightened my under-eyes a lot  and was a good prive\\r\\nThis is very similar to the aqua bomb moisturizer but just targeted for the under eye. It has a nice lightweight texture. I noticed hydration immediately but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help with any fine lines\\r\\nIf you want your eyes to look bright and tight, try this.

I do find it a bit too much for during the day, but it is a nice one to use at night! I am not the biggest fan about how this has fragrance though. I do find it can sometimes burn the skin around my eyes.\\r\\nYou CANNOT beat this price for the wonderful product that you get. Belif really delivers on its claims here and leaves your under eyes hydrated and plump.\\r\\nI don\\'t really need or use eye creams because I\\'m pretty young, but I got this as a sample and it\\'s great!

The texture of the #eyebomb was #smooth and #light. After applying for a few days, I noticed my eyes just felt more refreshed. I love the moisture it gives my undereye area. It works well for all skin types and helps smooth #finelines. I used to apply this at night but now I will include it in my #morning #routine as well since it works so well.

I needed an eye cream to help with my fine lines around my eyes. I believe that this stuff does work and besides for the normal eye creases i have i think it has improved. You can also wear this under your makeup. \\r\\nThis eye contour is my favorite today, it leaves the contour very hydrated but it does not leave me shine, I love it very much belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for something light and leaving your skin flawless this is the one. I love the feeling it leaves and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing there. It is my first time using but I will definitely be putting this into my everyday routine.\\r\\nI love it. Is very gentle and it works perfectly on me. This is an amazing eye cream. I\\'ve been using this cream for a month and my eyes looks so hydrated. I\\'m happy with the result. I see the different just within a couple days. The price is low\\r\\nSooo hydrating and light. I love it. Great for day time and under make up, keeps you hydrated all day. A bit expensive though\\r\\nVery good eye cream that has helped my dry under eyes significantly. Removed one star for the price, it is a little high for what it is.\\r\\nGot this as a sample and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it nonstop. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lasted for at least 3 weeks at this point which is so impressive! Feels like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really doing something and actually hydrating under my eyes. Tip: try leaving it in the fridge overnight to help boost the depuffing qualities of the eye cream\\r\\nThis was the first eye cream I have ever used - so I do not have much to compare it to - however I love it! It has a cooling effect that is great for the mornings and leaves my under eyes feeling refreshed. I have noticed slight change over time in the brightness of my under eye area! I think comparable to other brands the price is right as well. Would recommend!\\r\\nMy favourite eye cream \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa5\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa5\\xe2\\x98\\xba\\xef\\xb8\\x8f makes my skin healthy and moisturized around the eyes. Also Has an anti-wrinkle effect\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xab\\r\\nOne of my favorite eye creams. First tried this in a sample set and liked how it felt and wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t freeze in the morning. Good light scent to it.\\r\\nthis is my favorite eye cream. a little bit goes a long way, and the container lasts forever despite what would seem like a small amount of product. the value is there. gets rid of bags and dark circles. perfectly plumps up the under eye area. a regular part of my routine.\\r\\nLove love love this eye bomb. The jar is a really large size for an eye cream so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really more affordable than most for how much product you get. But what I love about it most is how cooling and hydrating it feels immediately when you put it on.\\r\\nI know that this product has a bunch of great reviews, but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see much of a difference! My eyelids tend to get really greasy throughout the day and this product seemed to make it worse. This would probably be better for someone with dryer skin around their eyes.\\r\\nThis stuff works like a charm! I used to use it at night but recently I decided to start using it in the mornings. This makes putting concealer on and baking so much cleaner! This helped my under eye bags out so much!\\r\\nI have dark circles and puffy eyes in the morning. It does the price-quality relationship. It is very good and moisturizing. It has gone way up for my expectations\\r\\nMost lightweight eye cream. Amazing but a little expensive for an eye cream. It has a really nice cooling feeling.\\r\\nIve tried many eye creams. This one is okay. I dont see much difference when using this but it is very moisturizing.\\r\\nThis was so hydrating under my eyes. I have dry undereyes and lids and this really helped out with that\\r\\nLove this eye cream. Very thick and great for overnight use. Hydrating and nonscented.\\r\\nI feel like this is very moisturizing. It is perfect for day time use. I typically use this underneath my make up, and it helps it blend well.\\r\\nI have the travel size in this product and I really like it!!! It leaves my under eyes so hydrated and looking fresh under makeup. I can use it day or night, although I prefer in the day as I like heavier eye creams at night. I do recommend for those in their 20s-30s looking for an eye cream.\\r\\nI liked this product it helped with the dark circles, and the under eye bags and diminished the appearance of crows feet im very pleased with this product\\r\\nI liked this. The texture was nice, and the scent did not bother me. Sometimes products have too much perfume, and I feel this one did not.\\r\\nI think this is my best eye cream ever l used it every day at night it makes you feel better when you put it so l recommended\\r\\nI really enjoy this eye cream. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel like it does anything for anti aging or discoloration but hydration is a win! I used to get little bits of texture around the top of my nose and around my eyes from dry skin and this helps it look more smooth and moisturized\\r\\nthis was not outright bad, but I have plenty of products that I prefer over this. I do not think that it was hydrating and moisturizing enough for me. It would be great on someone who had less dry of skin than I do.\\r\\nI have been obsessed with this line from belief! The aqua bombs are perfect for any skin type! I thought that the belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb would be too much for my skin when my friend with very dry skin and eczema recommended it to me! But wow was I surprised, it is water based which doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t break out my oily combination skin! Highly highly recommend!!\\r\\nI really love this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s creamy and hydrating and has a nice light scent that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my eye area. I alternate between using this around my eyes and the fresh rose cream which I use as an eye cream instead of all over face moisturizer\\r\\nI got a free sample but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any difference or maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just me. Not a product I would buy\\r\\nI love it it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good my eyes look great so I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what to say\\xef\\xbf\\xbc So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll pick it up I guess\\r\\nThis eye creme is great and cooling . I do need a little bit more hydration so I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t repurchase but if you have oily skin I definitely would try it.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very simple yet hydrating eye cream. Packaging is nice but it can irritate those with sensitive under eye areas. If you are prone to irritations I would avoid using this eye cream and go for something  with clean ingredients.\\r\\nI really love this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s creamy and hydrating and has a nice light scent that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my eye area. I alternate between using this around my eyes and the fresh rose cream which I use as an eye cream instead of all over face moisturizer\\r\\nThis is such a great eye cream. I especially love to use it before makeup application because it plumps up the skin beautifully and adds a layer of hydration but without leaving a film under the eyes. Makeup goes on top beautifully and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cake, crunch or bunch!\\r\\nI loved this product I bought the whole set and honestly the best eye cream I have ever tried in a long time doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave your under eye greasy and actually really works I seen a difference with my under eye appearance after 2 weeks just ordered another one from Sephora !\\r\\nI\\'ve been trying out a sample of this for a few weeks and NEED to buy the full size. It is so hydrating. My under eye area has never looked better. When I powder my concealer it doesn\\'t look as crepe-y as it did before.\\r\\nI received this product in the iPSY glow up set that I received today! I keep it in my beauty fridge, and it feels nice and cool around my eyes. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a great moisturizing eye cream!\\r\\noverall was a good eye gel. calmed down puffy eyes in the morning and was hydrating. please take the fragrance out and it would be a dream!!!\\r\\nI received the deluxe size as a gift. I love it! It takes such a tiny amount to do its magic. I will definitely get the full size next month.  I now use this twice a day. It takes just barely any product that it lasts. It seems expensive but you replace it so infrequently that it will cost less in the long run!\\r\\nThis is one of my favorite eye creams! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydrating and minimizes the appearance of puffiness under my eyes! I really like this product.\\r\\nI love this product so much!!! this is an eye balm that instantly melts into your skin. i have a sample because its too expensive for me to buy so when i run out of sample i will have to find a new sample. but i love the consistaciy and theres no smell to the product. \\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI got this eye cream in an Ipsy bag. After first use, it left my eyes feeling fully hydrated and refreshed. It has a slight fragrance to it, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not overwhelming. The product is expensive so I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t repurchased yet.\\r\\nWonderful eye cream!! The skin around my eyes is more on the normal side, but also sensitive and it just soaks up this cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so hydrating and I love using it at night, and will keep repurchasing.\\r\\nSuper lightweight. I use this under my moisturizer because my moisturizer is a thicker cream and it works wonders. \\r\\nI like this brand but this was a big miss. Most reviews I read are positive so it could be just me, but I found it very greasy\\r\\nI love the dewy affect this gives the eye. It brightens the skin around the eye with just hydration alone. For the really dry months I have to use something thicker but otherwise this is a wonderful day to day eye cream.\\r\\nIt so refreshing and moisturizing but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make under eye hydrating for long. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identical with Peter  Thomas Root cloud hyaluronic cream.\\r\\nLove this eye bomb for before bed! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s calming and cooling and makes my under eyes feel really hydrated. I alternate between this and the ordinary caffeine solution which I prefer more for everyday but I love this product at night.\\r\\ni tried a sample of this and it worked okay. i didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really notice a huge difference and i probably wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t purchase the full size\\r\\nI give this a three. It works great however dissapointed in the fact that there is fragrance in this product\\r\\nI like this cream for the eye contour since its technology makes it penetrate much faster and therefore it will have a faster action that translates to having the area well hydrated to prevent premature wrinkles\\r\\nloveeee. if you have dry under eyes you need this. i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m 19 and i don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have much under eye circles or darkness so this eye product is perfect for me because it moistures my under eyes and makes my skin look so smooth and flawless. my makeup applies so much better and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cake up under my eyes because of this product! it is pricy but the product contains more product than most other eye creams do.\\r\\nPeople say this thing don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. Might be true BUT it feels so good under the eyes. Gentle enough and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sting the skin around your eyes. Has a calming effect when you put it on. Scent is good. Clean n fresh.\\r\\nI am obsessed with this eye bomb! I struggle with dark, sunken-in eyes and this really makes them look alive! Steer clear, however, if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like tingling. Otherwise, it works perfect for sensitive eyes. I will definitely be repurchasing the product again and again!\\r\\nIt does what it says, moisturize. I have problems with dark circles so this product didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help with that. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like the aqua bomb but a lot thicker consistency. I think it helped brighten up my lower area a little bit. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not way too thick consistency and absorbs well into the skin.\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how this product works on its own! I have always used it with the full belif kit. Like the water essence, moisturizer, sleeping mask and all. So with all this it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty good!\\r\\nLove this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the same texture as the aqua bomb, making my under eye area hydrated. It helps reduce my dark circles and puffiness. Definitely worth the price! I will buy it again for sure!!! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI got this in my Ipsy bag and I am really impressed. This eye cream is very hydrating. It also smells good.\\r\\nVery good for dry under eyes, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything for dark circles but it does hydrate and plump you under eyes. Works well under makeup.\\r\\n I received this in my topbox augest 2019 and i finished this product may 2 2020 you only need alittle bit it definitely works well to snooth out lines and keep eyes moisturized i have always enjoyed the belief brand i have very sensitive skin and i have not had any issues with any of their products i definitely reccomend it\\r\\nVery nice eye cream. It keeps the under eye moisturized but isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t greasy or heavy. Absorbs quickly and works well under makeup.\\r\\nThis product feels so refreshing on the eyes. It is very effective at getting rid of your tired, puffy look and is cooling. The only way I would improve thia broduct is if it had a lifting agent in it, but I love it just how it is. It\\'s fragrance free and great for sensitive skin. No harsh fragrance or chemicals! Message me if interested in the product as I am an Avon representative. \\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\r\\nLOVE this eye cream! It\\'s the best for instant moisture (works wonders for winter in Colorado). It absorbs instantly and leaves under eye hydrated all day. Seriously. Buy this product.   belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI got this first in my Ipsy Bag a few months back and I fell in love and had to go buy a full-size one. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m gonna be 37 in July and I worry about my under eye creases especially when I smile. I put this on before I go to sleep and it helps so much\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nI really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ever notice a difference with eye creams so i wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recommend buying it. I got it with a Christmas bundle it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice not irritating but wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t spend money on it\\r\\nI have genetic dark circles but this keeps them on the bright side. It did meet my expectations. This product is a little on the expensive side and the packaging is so cute. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d recommend it to others.\\r\\nI use this before I go to sleep. I keep in chilled and helps with my puffiness under my eyes.\\r\\nI love love love this product! It is super hydrating (I only use it at night before going to bed) and helps with my dark circles in the morning when I wake up. A little bit goes a long way, so this product lasts a long time. I keep it in my skincare fridge to make it extra refreshing when I put it on!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis is a great eye cream! After using, I noticed that my skin felt soft. My eyes were no longer puffy and I saw a reduction in the color of my dark circles. As time goes on using this, I am certain that I will see improvement!\\r\\nThis is great stuff. I am exposed to a lot of sun. This is hydrating. I wish it lasted longer. It gives me a quick boost, but I have to re-apply quite often. It does improve the look of aging.\\r\\nI received this product in a Sephora Play box and have been using it for about three weeks now. I don\\'t see any difference on my eyes to be honest but I will say that it goes great under my concealer/make-up! It does not get rid of my dark circles (I use the cream AM/PM) and it doesn\\'t build up under your eye or crease so that\\'s nice- but it really hasn\\'t done anything else. Looking for other eye-cream recommendations specifically for dark circles/bags! \\r\\nI absolutely love this eye cream!! It is so hydrating and very gentle. My eyes are definitely less dry since using this product!!\\r\\nThe Moisturizing Eye Bomb is such a beautiful eye cream. It adds great moisture to the skin around the eye without being greasy or oily. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve purchased this a few times and it never disappoints. I prefer to use in the daytime when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on the go. The only reason it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get 5 stars is because I have an eye cream that I love just a bit more!\\r\\nSuch a hydrating eye cream! Helps allow my concealer to be applied evenly with a flawless finish\\r\\nI really felt the difference when using this eye cream. It was truly one of the best eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used. I absolutely love BELIF products - their cream and eye creams - but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slightly in the higher price range for the amount it provides in the decisive gain big jar packaging.\\r\\nThis is a very smooth eye cream. It feels very high end. There is a distinct smell, but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bother me. Belif products are very stable across the board, you know what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get. Try it to see how you respond to it.\\r\\nI love this. Very hydrating for my super dry under eyes. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritating. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not meant to help dark circles, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t struggle with those. I mainly struggle with lack of hydration.\\r\\nThis is a great under eye cream.  I have used quite a few and I keep going back to this.  It helps hydrate and plump up my under eye.   I also noticed that it has lessened my dark under eye circles.  Highly recommend!\\r\\nThis is great! This product leaves my undereyes moisturized and smooth looking. I would recommend this to everyone.\\r\\nreally moisturizing. love the consistency and texture of it. no fragrance added and i haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed any negative reactions on my skin since using it. will continue to use!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not too picky with eye creams, but this particular one feels SO good going on. It is thick/creamy and you can almost feel it forming your skin.\\r\\nThe gel-cream consistency is lightweight and easily absorbed, leaving the skin moisturized and keeping my under eye HYDRATED throughout most of the day (I do work 10-hour shifts and wear undereye concealer which can get a bit dry). It has a long list of INGREDIENTS including many plant extracts but is also on the Sephora Clean list. The slight herbal scent is from a natural origin and not artificial. It\\'s barely noticeable but soothing.\\r\\nThis is my absolute favorite eye cream! The packaging is cute, it applies easily and you only need a little bit. It works amazing, it is super moisturizing, and I recommend this for a good eye cream. It is just awesome!\\r\\nI have many problems around the eye I think this product is the best solution to solve my problem I really want to try it I will be happy if I got it valid for everyone and my skin will be really happy because I solved its problem I really hope and very much to get your wonderful and very beautiful product\\r\\nVERY moisturizing. Great for mature, dehydrated and tired eyes with fine lines. Lots of moisture for a dewy finish\\r\\nGreat eye cream!! Super moisturizing and feels really light underneath my eyes. A little goes a long way. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say anything bad about this product. Love all belif products!\\r\\ni first got this product as a sample from sephora and i loved it so much i went back to buy the full size. the only flaw with this product is the price, it is a little expensive but it works super well. helped bring back moisture to my under eyes\\r\\nIf you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have this product then it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to switch. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a silky gel-based product. Not much of a smell and it glides on like velvet. I always notice my eyes seeming more dewy and fresh looking. It stays on nicely and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mess up my concealer at all. I have dryish skin and I live in a dry climate, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect for me. That said, it feels a bit heavy when I travel to humid places.\\r\\nI love this eye cream because it is lightweight while being moisturizing with a great spa-like scent. It also is a little cooling which is great for under eyes.\\r\\nI love the scent this product has! Its consistency is amazing and it is really moisturizing. I will definitely be purchasing more once I finish mine!\\r\\nI really like this product, it definitely makes my undereyes less dry. I personally don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have significant undereye issues but I use this to prevent. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice consistency and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a strong smell.\\r\\nSO AMAZING!!  it gives my eyes that \"pop\" of color when I feel like my face looks dull somedays. I use it regularly to maintain my face moisturized because these pasts days it\\'s been drier than normal. The scent is just oh so heavenly too;  a must buy for skincare belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb !\\r\\nThis is the only eye cream I will use now! I have dark puffy circles and this cream makes my under eyes feel moisturized and cooled\\r\\nTell your dark circles goodbye because this product will tighten, lighten, and soften your under eyes. Up all night studying? No worries take a little smidge of this and dab with your ring finger along your dark circles, it works wonders. Add this to your routine and I swear you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see progress!\\r\\nThis is the best eye cream I have used and actually seen/felt a difference. Back in December 2019, I received three Sephora gift cards for Christmas. I had been wanting to try out some K beauty for a while. I got the set that had this, the cleanser and moisturizer in it. After using it for maybe a week, I could tell a big difference. \\r\\nThis is a great eye cream for moisturizing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very rich and creamy and leaves the eye area so hydrated. Definitely a favorite.\\r\\nI love the jail feels this product the jail seems to just ignore very quickly to my skin and feel very refreshing I really enjoy this product and I would buy it again\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nThis is the best hydrating gel eye cream I have ever used! The texture is smooth and is not irritating! It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a smell which is good and this can be found on Ulta or Sephora website! I love love love this!\\r\\nThis is a great eye moisturizer but I got red dots under my eyes when I used it. I love the moister but the red dots weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t good.\\r\\nLove this eye cream! A little goes a long way. Does not irritate my eyes. So moisturizing! Absorbs quickly.\\r\\nA great cream if you are looking for hydration.  Perfect for young skin! \\xe2\\x9c\\xa8 The cream perfectly moisturizes the delicate skin of the eyelids \\xf0\\x9f\\xa5\\xb0\\r\\nThis was pretty good.. I would definitely recommend it for normal/not as dry skin. Because I get eczema on my eyelids I get flaky dry skin and this wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enough since this is a water based solution.\\r\\nThis eye cream was okay. I need something that does a bit more for my heavy bags. The small sample size did last me quite a long time though!\\r\\nIt does it\\'s job in terms of hydration but I feel that\\'s only initial; in the beginning of your day. But I didn\\'t see a huge difference under my eyes. I wouldn\\'t purchase again but if you\\'re looking for hydration then this is the one for you.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nIt is soooooooooooo great!!!!!!!! I\\'ve been using this for over a year and I haven\\'t even run out, it makes my under eyes feel sooo good and it lasts forever too, this is my favorite eye cream and it probably will always be my favorite eye cream.\\r\\nThis is my all time favorite eye cream. I use it every night! Belif typically makes seasonal packages where you get a full size moisturizer with a deluxe sample cleanser and eye bomb, so I always have my mini bombs handy when traveling. You can feel the cooling moisture immediately upon applying. I wake up everyday looking dewy and refreshed thanks to this amazing eye bomb!!\\r\\nMOISTURE!!! Great products to increase moisture under eyes. Love this product and will use forever!\\r\\nThis eye contour cream provides a real long-lasting hydration bath - up to 26 hours - and improves the elasticity of the eye contour for a visibly rejuvenated look and for flawless makeup!\\r\\nI love this eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating and the texture is amazing!! I use it with the aqua bomb (which is my favorite moisturizer EVER) and my face always feels refreshed and moisturized!!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never tried an eye cream that has truly left my eye moisturized and feeling extra fresh!\\r\\nI really enjoyed this eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a gel consistency but a bit thicker than i was expecting. It does really calm the dark circles but i saw a little milia forming. Only thing was that i didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it for a few months and went back and feel that the gel hardened a little bit\\r\\nHit 27, now think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crucial to have an eye cream. This is the first I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever tried, from Topbox. An extremely cooling and soothing cream, my skin immediately look healthier. Only a small dab of ring finger is needed, then touch that with other ring finger and apply under eyes.\\r\\nMy mother and I, we both are using this product, but for me, personally, this cream has been an irreplaceable product for 2 years. To be honest, I don\\'t have wrinkles around my eyes to tell the difference, but it perfectly moisturizes the skin around the eyes and it is enough to apply a very small amount.\\r\\nGreat under eye moisturizer.  Very light and no scent to it.  I have very sensitive skin and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cause any irritations!\\r\\nreally good eye cream! definitely doesn\\'t compare to my favorite Laneige eye cream, but a close second. Has a really nice herbal smell, but could do with more moisture personally.\\r\\nLove the belif moisturizing eye bomb. I have been using for quite a while and my skin used to be very dry especially around the eyes. This product has left my eye area looking very hydrated and brightened as well\\r\\nI like this eye cream but sometimes the skin under my eyes would feel tight after using this. I ended up switching to a different product that worked better for my skin as i don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the tight feeling.\\r\\ni love this eye bomb! i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this for a good 5-6 months now and i got the small travel size one and a little goes a long way. it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my under eyes.\\r\\nI got a sample of this eye cream and I finished using it. I liked it a lot. I was very creamy and light weight. It sinks into my skin very fast and moisturize it very well. It does not have any smell. I used it every morning and evening. I liked that even with the makeup on I did not feel anything under my eye. I will buy it again. If you are looking for a new eye cream, do try it.\\r\\nI love this product because of how moisturized it leaves my eyes feeling. When I used this product consistently I can even see it helping my dark under eyes. It is a very gentle formula which I love and highly recommend \\xe2\\x9c\\x85\\r\\nThis product is incredibly moisturizing. I used this for about a month every night before bed. I found that this made my skin under my eyes to be smoother and plumper while also reducing puffiness. I also thought this product felt very nice on my skin. The hydrating properties in this moisturizer are definitely long lasting and I feel that using this product has changed the texture of my skin under my eyes to be smoother.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m honestly saving up so I can buy this. I borrowed it from a friend and I was so happy with the results. It is super moisturizing and refreshing and made my skin feel like new. I would absolutely recommend it.\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it is worth the price. It does what it says and moisturizes but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  all the benefits you get it seems. The smell is nice and it feels good going on.\\r\\nI love this eye cream. So smooth and cooling, great for under eyes in the morning! Super gentle and clean feeling when applying. A little goes a long way so worth the money! So happy with this product!\\r\\nBy far the best eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used. I use day and night and it has seriously helped my crows feet\\r\\nIdk if I love this, I have a bit of dryness and this feels nice but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that I felt moisturizing.\\r\\nThis product felt really nice and hydrating on my under eye. However when using it under makeup its left greasy with kind of a film. Would recommend for night use only!!\\r\\nSuper hydrating eye cream, lasts a long time too. I just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a product that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s changed my life in any way, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a pretty basic eye cream\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good eye cream , it gets the job done . It feels nice and hydrating and I I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll definitely use up the whole jar. The only thing is the price , there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cheaper ones out there that basically do the same . I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rebuy this product .\\r\\nSuch a good hydrating eye cream. You only need a tiny amount otherwise you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have too much. Belif has some of the best affordable skin care products.\\r\\nThis is really hydration bomb for your eyes. Absorbs really quickly, hydrates very well. Jar is big - it will last you for a long time. It was very Effective - I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used up 4 packagings until now. Love it and will repurchase.\\r\\nI really liked this eyecrem. I saw a difference in my skin after a couple of days of using it. It left my under eye less puffy, refresh and moisturized. Super effective! Will repurchase full size!\\r\\nI love this product. It\\'s moisturizing enough to use at night while being light enough to also wear under my concealer in the mornings (just make sure to give it a few minutes to set!). It also lasts a long time!! I purchased this product in March 2019 and 12 months later I am barely running out despite using it 4-5 times a week\\r\\nThe only eye cream I have ever tried and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t plan on ever changing! It really moisturizes the skin around your eyes, it is very helpful when it gets cold.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s light but very hydrating!! Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel heavy or oily!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best and I love it!! I would definitely buy this again :D\\r\\nThis stuff is kinda smelly like old lady cream but I still give it 5 stars, it reduces those saggy bags and puffy eyes and it feels great too.\\r\\nI purchased this eye bomb as part of a set\\xef\\xbf\\xbc, so it came in a smaller size, but it was the perfect amount to make me realize I wanted to purchase the full size version! Although I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed any kind of a difference as far as dark circles go, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extremely moisturizing which gives a much more bright and alive look to my eyes!\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nGreat eye cream for ultimate moisture. But did not work well for my oily skin. Would recommend to dry or combination skin.\\r\\nI love this stuff, got in my Ipsy then purchased once i ran out. I noticed a difference and it felt so good on\\r\\nI loveeeee this eye cream. I have really deep set wrinkles and this has worked wonders on my eyes. It leaves my eyes feeling moisturized and ouffff it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s honestly worth the money\\r\\nMy favorite eye cream i have tried. Really thinking about repurchasing. I went through a full size of this, it took FOREVER! There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so much product deep in the jar and you only need so little.\\r\\nI love this product. I got it in a subscription box. It\\'s very effective and very gentle. A little bit of product goes a long way. The very first time I bought an eye cream, it was a very cheap brand and I hated it. It really turned me away from eye creams. But then I got this in a subscription bag and it made me fall in love with eye creams!\\r\\nI liked this eye bomb very much. I thought it was quite moisturizing but also light and refreshing. I really enjoyed the way it felt on my skin. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very light formula which was probably my favorite part about it. This cream was also very refreshing and I would recommend it to a friend\\r\\nMy favorite eye cream!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so moisturizing and it feels really good and refreshing under the eyes. The scent is a slight fresh scent which smells so good and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too much. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a gel like moisturizer which I love, and I would definitely repurchase.\\r\\nThis is fine, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if you need this and the regular moisturizer. They feel the same and like they do the same thing. I like it and it feels good, but not sure it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s necessary.\\r\\nWorks amazing. $48 seems like a lot, but this product was honestly worth it and you do see results\\r\\nthis is the perfect eye cream if your looking to just depuff and moisturize the under eye, you only need a very small amount so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll last you a very long time which makes the 48 dollar price tag worth it\\r\\nLove this lightweight and hydrating eye cream. Perfect for morning and night, works well under makeup\\r\\nReceived a travel size and I felt it did hydrate my eyes. It can be pricey for the full size but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth it. Will definitely buy it again. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel harsh or tough it was great.\\r\\nI got a sample of this as an Ipsy member and it was a bit too watery for me skin. It almost felt like my skin absorbed it immediately. I would recommend a more thicker moisturizer for my skin type\\r\\nI got this from my daughter in law in a sample size and I am so happy with it. I had never heard of it and I have super dry skin. So I thought I would try it out. A tiny dab is all you need and it works instantly to make my skin feel very soft and supple. It also lasts all day. My concealer lays down smoother and my eyes look and feel younger. I have severe dryness on the edges of my nose and on the bridge of my nose so I will dab a little on there as well and it\\'s absolutely done wonders! I can\\'t rave about this eye cream enough!\\r\\nI can\\'t really tell any difference when I used this because it was only a very small sample. But I like that it doesn\\'t smell at all and easy to apply. Not oily not sticky. It didn\\'t irritate my eyes too. I love that it has cooling effect though it was only in my room not from the fridge. Still, would recommend this to try.\\r\\nLove love love love love love this eye cream. I use it every morning and I can totally tell a difference in my under eye area. It helps with bags and makes my skin glow and look vibrant\\r\\nThis is my all time favorite under eye moisturizer. My under eyes feel so refreshed every time I use it, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this for years. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I could switch to anything else.\\r\\nI got this in a little Ipsy bag once and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never really tried out eye creams but since I received this one I gave it a go and I have enjoyed it. It leaves a little cooling sensation so it leaves like my under eye area feeling new and refreshed\\r\\nA very nice light eye cream. It goes well with the aqua bomb moisturizer. You have to be careful to use a little bit so it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pill up around the eyes. A little goes a long way!\\r\\nMan, I wish this product could have worked out better for me. I loved it the first week I used it--the gel texture was so refreshing to my under-eye, and I definitely noticed that my skin was super hydrated! Sadly, after a week of usage, I developed an itchy reaction around my eyes, probably from the fragrance or plant extracts in the formula. Such a bummer, as the feel of the eye cream is really nice! Overall, I would recommend other options on the market over this one.\\r\\nI love this eye cream.Super hydrating and has the same great fragrance as the moisturizer.\\r\\nThis eye cream is amazing! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so hydrating & makes your under eyes look so smooth.\\r\\nI am obsessed with this eye cream. It feels sooo moisturizing and soft. It works nicely under makeup and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave any texture or product.\\r\\nAmazing hydration for dry under eyes, my favorite eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used! Well worth the money\\r\\nThis eye cream basically is like giving your under eyes a tall glass of water. It\\'s so hydrating and a little goes a long way. It lasts forever! I wouldn\\'t say it gets rid of dark circles but it does hydrate and fill in fine lines really well!!\\r\\nThis is a wonderful skincare brand. The price is reasonable and the products perform well and as claimed.  I use the moisturizing bomb at night and pair it with this eye cream.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very lush and hydrating.  It hydrates and moisturizes the delicate skin under my eyes.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also great under concealer.\\r\\nIt feels really nice on my eyes as it\\'s quite watery and moisturizing.\\xc2\\xa0 I don\\'t know how hydrating it is as I have very dry under eye area and I feel that it doesn\\'t do a super great job and hydrating my dry areas.\\xc2\\xa0 But I really like how it feels on my eyes.\\xc2\\xa0 For the price point, I like it.\\r\\nMakes a huge difference with my eyes. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hydrating and conditioning. Soo smooth!\\r\\nI got a sample of this in one of my boxes. So as always I gave it a try and boy let me say I was happy I did. I always have had a problem with dark circles but after a few days of using this morning & night, I noticed a big difference. My eyes look younger and dont need anymore concealer then normal now! So thank you!\\r\\nSo far so good. I got this as a Sephora beauty reward mini and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it for two weeks and I enjoy its soothing fresh feel and I do see my eyes much more soft and refreshed looking.\\r\\nThere is an ingredient in here that irritates my eye, even if its just on my lid. If it does happen to get in my eye it hurts like crazy. I prefer Clinque All About Eyes.\\r\\nThis stuff is amazing. It is so gentle.  I had horribly dry eyelids due to accutane and I was unable to use any type of eye cream except this.  I was able to apply this and the peeling and cracking resolved very quickly.  I have sensitive skin around my eyes and I continue to use this.  Highly recommend.\\r\\nLoveeee this eye bomb. Keeps my under eyes so hydrated. I use this at night and sometimes before applying makeup. It is a little pricey but worth it\\r\\nWhile this felt super nice underneath my eyes, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice a huge difference. But it was super nourishing and moisturizing for my skin and I really appreciated it! I would maybe recommend to a friend\\r\\nBeautiful product. Very refreshing on the eyes and moisturizing. After you apply and dap it in, it will take a few minutes for it to soak into your skin and when it does it is soothing and smooths put your under eyes. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb Definitely recommend this if you are looking for an eye cream. The smell is not weird or fragranced. It smells lovely.\\r\\nGot this in my sephora play box. Absolutely loved how lightweight yet so moisturizing it was.\\r\\nAt 26 I just started using eye cream and this was my first purchase. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it for about four months and can say the hydration is amazing! However I notice if I stray too far away from my eye area I develop bumps or pimples. Another reason why I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give it five stars is because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think this product is formulated with the best ingredients compared to other products. Sadly they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re also NOT cruelty free, which I found out a few months after already using the product.\\r\\nI received this in a set with other Belif products. I have only used a few times, but it seems to be a hydrating product. I am hesitant on if I need to purchase a full size, but so far I do like the product.\\r\\nI absolutely love this eye cream. It helps my dark circles. I put it on at night and when I wake up my eyes are not puffy and feel Amazing.\\r\\nLa crema me resulta muy agradable, se siente s\\xc3\\xbaper hidratante y ligera al aplicarse en el contorno de los ojos, el \\xc3\\xbanico inconveniente que el encontrar\\xc3\\xada ser\\xc3\\xada la fragancia (que aunque me resulte agradable, podr\\xc3\\xada ser irritante para personas con pieles muy sensibles)\\r\\nThis is my favorite eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more of a gel so it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get too heavy for daytime use and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed some improvement in my under eye bags since starting to use it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll continue to purchase this.\\r\\nBest eye bomb out there. I have used this since day one and won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stray away from it since it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done wonders for my under eyes.\\r\\nI love this eye bomb and it has become a staple in my nightly routine. It has a thick consistency and leaves my undereyes feeling super moisturized the next morning. I only wish it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so expensive but thankfully a little goes a long way!\\r\\nI received a sample of this from I think IPSY. I have been using it ever since and have really liked it. The cream is thick and it has lasted a long time. I use it almost every night. I would recommend to others.\\r\\nOBSESSED with this eye cream. It smells amazing and goes on super thick!! I use it at night before bed and wake up with smooth under eyes\\r\\nThis eye cream is super moisturizing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my favorite hands down. I reserve it for when I need extra moisture because it is on the pricey side.\\r\\nI love the texture of this eye cream. I store it in a skincare fridge and love how cooling and depuffing it is. It sits well under concealer. Definitely recommend.\\r\\nI LOVE belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. I use this whenever I feel like I need an extra moisture boost to my under eye. Its thick but not too thick, it soaks in really nicely and doesn\\'t feel greasy. It makes my skin soft and smooth. It\\'s so effective and I just keep coming back to it.\\r\\nA very nice moisturizing eye cream indeed. Nothing too crazy about it. It does what it says it does and I do enjoy it. Wish it had more benefits to it.\\r\\nThis stuff is great!  I love how it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a gel so it absorbs quickly and it feels so good on your skin.  It absorbs quickly also which is a definite bonus\\r\\nI ADORE this eye cream as a hydrator. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the bells and whistles of an eye depuffer or retinol cream, but it delivers so much hydration to the undereye area that it often accomplishes the same thing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s divine.\\r\\nThis is one os the best moisturizers that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever had, instantly my eyes look so healthy and light, no darks around or anything, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s literally insane. And I also got the small version and it lasts long cause I only need a little bit of it for each eye.\\r\\nThis is my all time favorite eye cream. I didn\\'t know until very recently that I had dry under eyes, and as soon as I started using this I noticed a HUGE difference. My dark circles started disappearing, makeup didn\\'t burn anymore, and I looked fresh all the time. I absolutely love this product!! I recommend it to everyone - my mom, my friends, my (almost) husband... everyone!\\r\\nThis is a pretty standard eye cream. Very moisturizing and thick. Nice for the winter.\\r\\nI like the texture but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m getting the results I should be. However I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it nearly as regularly as I should.\\r\\nThis eye cream is incredible. Will always repurchase. Completely recommend. I am starting to have fine lines around my eyes and this makes them disappear!\\r\\nExtremely moisturizing and soothing for long days after work and school.  A little bit goes a long way and my eyes instantly look hydrated and refreshed. This product definitely exceeded my expectations.\\r\\nI really liked the slight smell of this, but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice any results to write home about. I prefer other eye creams but I did feel hydrated. So it did what it was supposed to. I think my expectations were off.\\r\\nLove this eye cream so much!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really rich and a little goes a long way! I love how it makes my eyes look moisturized and soft after waking up! I use this with other belif products and they are magical. Would buy again and again.\\r\\nUsed this for a few months a few years ago and recently repurchased. I love it! Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why I stopped using but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so light weight but super hydrating and works so well under my concealer too!\\r\\nI love it as if it were a first for eye shadows and I also apply it in dark circles, it helps to moisturize the area and makes the makeup last longer in this area\\r\\nI love this stuff! I feel that it really helps hydrate underneath my eyes. I use it day and night along side my Belif aqua bomb moisturizer at night and my sunscreen for the day.\\r\\nA solid hydrating eye cream that does not leave a greasy residue. Smells amazing as well. The only thing that I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like about this product is their packaging. I prefer eye creams to be in a squeeze tube or pump packing because it is more hygenic that way.\\r\\nThis is a great a bomb it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hydrating and feels great under the eye to give a cooling and plumbing affect. I like to put this in my refrigerator so it stays really cool and applies like a treatment in the morning to depuff and refresh\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nLove this stuff! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a gel texture so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super thin and easy to glide onto the eye area and provide really great moisture\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really moisturizing and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like the essence where it just feels like water. This one is slightly thicker and stays on top of your skin until it gets absorbed and leaves it feeling really soft :)\\r\\nThis is a decent eye moisturizer - not too thick where you would get milia and not so thin that you don\\'t feel hydrated. This was my first eye cream and while I think there are better out there, how much you love this might depend on what type of skin you have. If you need more hydration, I would skip this!\\r\\nI really like this product. It\\'s super light and the texture is similar to a gel. It layers nicely under makeup and it\\'s incredibly mild--no stinging or redness. It also hasn\\'t caused me to have breakouts or bumps under my eyes like some creams have done. I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s super moisturizing, but it\\'s a good product for people with normal or oily skin.\\r\\nLove everything about this product. My under eyes were really dry and this product brought them back to life. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a light weight cream/gel texture. Very effective and felt refreshing and hydrating on the under eye. No scent and I have bought this numerous times for myself and as a gift. Really great for all skin types and ages.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nMy favorite eye cream. Lasts quite a while. Very hydrating. A good value. Just take very good care of it! I once forgot to put the cap back on after using my first one and it dried up and didnt work as well so i had to toss it. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x85\\r\\nThis product leaves my eye area hydrated for hours. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super effective and glides on easy.\\r\\nGreat night time product for the eyes! Love the belief creams has it is very moisturizing\\r\\nI have dry under eyes and concealer makes them look crapey and accentuates the lines, i used this before makeup and my under eyes looked great, very hydrated and smooth! Love the cooling effect this gives, it smells really good too, texture is nice as well.\\r\\nThis stuff is amazing! I saw immediate changes to my eyes-less lines, less darkness, and healthier skin. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so gentle. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also super moisturizing but absorbs quickly. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s become my go to daily eye treatment.\\r\\nThis eye cream is great for tightening up the under eyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gentle and smooth to apply. I really like how moisturising it is. Although it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help much with dark circles it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a good eye cream. I would recommend this product.\\r\\nGreat for moisturizing the eyes. This did give me milia so I have not repurchased. Would work best with dry skin.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this eye cream at night before bed. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really do anything for my skin other than hydrate, but it does that extremely well. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using a sample now but I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy more when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone\\r\\nAmazing eye cream. Really moisturizes without leaving your skin oily. A little goes a long way.\\r\\nThis is life changing for dry under eye areas! I was so frustrated with my eye area aging me prematurely by being so dry. This makes my shape tape apply like a dream and my under eyes look hydrated throughout the day\\r\\nIf you have dry under eyes, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll love this. Super moisturizing, thin and soaks in quickly.\\r\\nNot sure if it really did anything, but it felt good on my under eyes. Would but again and pay better attention to the after effects.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used the belief aqua bomb products before and it always sits nicely on my skin and melts in nicely. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s soothing makes my skin feel nourished. I used this product on my eyes and out the remainder on my forehead. I then put the belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb on the entirety of my face,neck and any remainder in my chest and hands.\\r\\nI personally found that this product wasn\\'t much more effective than any other moisturizer I could apply near my eyes, but having it there to place in my eye area seemed to give me some good hydration. I give it 4 stars because it did make a difference, either because of it\\'s hydrating properties or eye safe qualities!\\r\\nAnother Ipsy sample and I use this each day. I will purchase a full size. A little goes a long way and the skin of my eyes loves this!\\r\\nI love this product. It made my under eyes feel so moisturized and smooth. I will definitely buy this again.\\r\\nThis eye cream is so refreshing in the morning! It did not disappoint. My eyes are puffy in the morning and this products help cool the under eye area. This is my first time using this product and I highly recommend.\\r\\nI like the product but have not noticed any different, very moisturizing, and feels good around the eyes, but some other brands work better for me,will use it up\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really feel like it does much for me and it does have fragrance which I do not like around my eyes or on my face.\\r\\nThis was the first eye cream I have ever used and it did not work well for me.\\xc2\\xa0 It did not make my dry patches under my eyes go away, but rather it made them worse.\\xc2\\xa0 The cream would not blend into my skin, but sit on top of it all day.\\r\\nThis is a great eye moisturizer. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very soothing and soaks right in which is great\\r\\nThis has been my favorite eye cream so far. I got is as sample in Ipsy and it has lasted me cyclist to a year.\\r\\nThis does give my eyes the drink of moisture they need, but it is way too heavy to use as a day eye cream. It does take awhile to absorb and can tend to sit on top of my skin for awhile before absorbing\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think this eye cream is that effective. The full size product has lasted me about 4 months (and I use very generous amounts on twice a day) which is great but I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen any benefits from using it. I also feel like it pills more often than not which is really annoying.\\r\\nCan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say enough good things about this. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating, light weight, does what it says. This has been a part of my routine for about a year and I love it.\\r\\nOne of very few eye creams that did not irritate the area under my eye. I got this as a sample to try from a subscription box and was pleased with it. It glides on easily, absorbs well and doesn\\'t leave my under eye feeling greasy or heavy and I really do feel like my undereye area is hydrated when I use it. I would recommend this product.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI\\'ve received lots of sample sizes of this product thanks to belif gift sets, and I enjoy the eye cream. It\\'s hydrating and feels nice under my eyes. It doesn\\'t claim to do a huge amount of things like get rid of bags and wrinkles, so this might not be for you if you\\'re older, but it\\'s a nice product. I don\\'t think I\\'d go out of my way to buy it, but considering that I don\\'t really use eye cream, that\\'s not saying a lot.\\r\\nI actually really love this! This is such a good eye cream, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not super heavy feeling under the eyes. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like a heavy cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gives you just enough hydration under the eyes to wear during the day for your morning skincare routine. However I found that for night this doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work out for me, I prefer a much thicker eye cream.\\r\\nFirst off the amount you get in the jar is so worth the money it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crazy. But the produce inside is where you get the value this makes my under eyes so extremely hydrated I take a small amount and pat it in and works amazing under make up. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know notice any benefits other then hydrated but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all I wanted when I bought this product.\\r\\nLoooove this eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so rich, yet light, it hydrates and helps with lines and darkness, it plumps, and is well worth the price tag!\\r\\nThis is one of my favorite eye creams I have ever used. I use it both in the morning under makeup and at night. The on downside is that it contains fragrance which I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like in my skincare. However, I can look past that since I love the consistency of the product.\\r\\nThis eye bomb is sort of like a gel cream. It is super hydrating and really smooths out your under eyes. Since using it I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve definitely noticed that my dark circles have become lighter.\\r\\nThis is actually a really good eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s light and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cause milia. It absorbs quickly under the eye and leaves the area soft, plump and hydrated. It wears well under makeup too. Long term use does hlep with making fine lines less noticeable.\\r\\nThis makes my under eyes so hydrated! I cannot get enough! I just wish it came in a pump so I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to stick my fingers in it!\\r\\nI got a trial size in my Ipsy bag and I use this everyday and I can really tell the difference! A little goes such a long way! This product will last you a long time if you let it! 100% recommend!\\r\\nLove this!  My under eye never looks as tired as it feels!  I love that a little goes a long way. I use it every morning and have been using it for the last six months. It is also reasonably priced compared to other eye creams.\\r\\nVery moisturizing eye creme. Leaves eyes feeling very fresh, and soft. Also some what affordable for an eye creme and is a good size!\\r\\nThis is a beautiful, lightweight eye cream. I wish it didn\\'t have fragrance which is why I didn\\'t give it five stars. It absorbs quickly and hydrates all day even under concealer and powder, which means my under eyes look better at the end of the day than with other eye creams.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI absolutely love this eye cream! It smells great and feels amazing on my eyes! It blends into my skin perfectly without leaving my eyes feel greasy or oily.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nWhile I did not see a significant difference in fine lines and wrinkles, this was an excellent cream to restore moisture to my under eyes. Again, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for anti-aging solutions I would get a different eye cream\\r\\nI like this moisturizing eye bomb as a little goes a long way. It feels cooling when I apply it and does help my bags look not so puffy. I only have a deluxe sample of this, so I\\'m sure with prolonged use, I would see better results. I would recommend it to others.\\r\\nExpensive but lasts forever (like, over a year!). Very hydrating. Good for night and under makeup. Love the scent!\\r\\nEvery moisturizing. I love water based moisturizers and eye creams. They are better for oily skin then the creamy ones. I love the smell. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t burn my eyes but it definitely doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take away my dark circles. It is more for the puffyness\\r\\nThis is a great go to eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a cooling formula with a light scent and moisturizing results\\r\\nI really like how this product hydrates my eyes, totally agree with the name lol, I tried this product because it came in my sephora box and after that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve buying it.\\r\\nI just love the way this eye cream feels. It is so silly and smooth. I was afraid I was going to go through it quickly, because the sample I received is very small, but a little bit goes a long way. It has a very nice fresh scent to it. It stays true to the claim of hydration!\\r\\nThis is my favorite eye cream. I love that it smells refreshing and not heavily perfumes. It is very light and the jar lasts a long time. It is extremely effective and does not clog my pores like other eye creams have for me in the past. I consistently buy this eye cream and continue to love it\\r\\nThis is literally the best eye cream. I think this entire skin care line is great for people who have picky and sensitive skin, because it has not irritating gel moisturizers that soothe the skin. This eye cream in particular is super hydrating while also being lightweight and just amazing. I put this on before I go to bed and when I wake up in the morning, and it keeps my eyes plump and hydrated. It even layers well under makeup. Favorite product\\r\\nThis stuff is the most hydrating ever! If you have dry skin these are life savers. Try it!\\r\\nI received this twice. From an ipsy bag and sephora play. It\\'s not greasy under my eye or near the outer corners of my eye. I basically apple where I see fine lines for my eye. I\\'ve noticed less lines under my eyes since it\\'s moisturizing. Definitely worth trying and I\\'m almost out.\\r\\nSuch a good eye cream really made my under eyes feel hydrated and plump. Made a huge difference when I applied makeup on my under eyes no more creases from lack of sleep! It fees so light on but makes a big difference I love this stuff actually the whole line is fantastic!\\r\\nI got this as a sample and I really love it. Eye creams are super hot or miss for me. I honestly feel like some actually dry out my u set eye, but this one is super moisturizing, and I really enjoy it.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good hydrating and moisturizing eye cream\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8c nothing extraordinary. Great for all skin types!\\r\\nThis is an amazing eye cream for the am. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got an almost minty feeling when you apply so it really awakens your eyes. Super gentle and you need very little product so a full sized will last you a very long time. Another great Belif product!\\r\\nThis is the only eye cream that hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritated my under eyes in any way. A little goes a long way so I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth paying $34 for. It lasts me months and it keeps my under eye area moisturizer and plump. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve purchased this 5x and will continue to do so.\\r\\nSuper hydrating and refreshing!  I love sticking this in my beauty fridge and putting it on cold to bring down puffy morning eyes.  My eyes are somewhat sensitive and this hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t caused me any issues and makeup goes on smoothly over this.  Will continue to purchase.\\r\\nLoving this eye balm, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so moisturizing and gentle. Goes good under makeup. Will be buying the full size when my sample runs out.\\r\\nBest eye cream ever. I have very sensitive eye area and so many eye creams burn the skin around my eyes and make my eyes water. This is very moisturizing, sits well under makeup and doesn\\'t irritate my eyes. 10/10!\\r\\nI received this in a sample size so only got to use this product for a short while. But I believe it is worth it\\'s price tag. This reduced the puffiness of my undereyes and I love the cooling effect. It s definitely an eye product worth buying and I would definitely go out and buy the dull size of this item.\\r\\nMy boyfriend and I both use this eye cream as it is intensely hydrating and does not irritate our sensitive skin. Other than that, I don\\'t think this product will address all of your skincare needs- i.e. reducing the appearance of puffiness or fine lines. Instead, I like to use this over another product so that my concealer doesn\\'t crease. \\r\\nI received this in my ipsy bag so I only tried a small size. It was non Irritating and rich in texture. Definitely made my under eyes moisturized without being oily. I would invest in the full size , for sure!\\r\\nPretty good eye cream. The price point is right, the scent is great, and the formula is intensely moisturizing and rich without being irritating or leaving a residue. My eyes look brighter and less creased after using this product. Also this brand is one of the best out there.\\r\\nI only tried a small trial size of this, but I love it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m currently using it. I know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quite pricey. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still contemplating if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth the price. Over all it is a great product very hydrating\\r\\nThis stuff is incredible and makes me feel like my eyes aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dry at all! I have very dry eye corners, and this almost helps to heal that as well. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a strong scent, which I also appreciate.\\r\\nNice moisturizer for under eye but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see anything else. If you expect a bit more from your eye cream go for something else\\r\\nThis is one of the best eyecreams on the market. It delivers, hydrates, diminishes puffiness, helps reduce fine lines. I love the packaging, the scent. I would use it forever\\r\\nNot a fan unfortunately. I used this a few years ago and it made my under eye area sting and tried this again last month and it gradually made it sting. Idk what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in this stuff but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s...completely useless to me.\\r\\nThis is another favorite of mine from this brand. I can\\'t say there\\'s anything from this brand that I don\\'t like. This eye cream is hydrating for my under eye area and I can see a difference when I don\\'t use it. This spreads very nicely, and is not heavy. It has no scent which is always a plus. This lasts forever. One won\\'t be disappointed if they decide to purchase.\\r\\nI received a sample of this as a pint perm at Sephora and it has lasted such a long time. You just need a tiny bit, so it goes a long way for what you get. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tingle like some eye creams can do. It moisturizers, but not too much that I feel like I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it in the mornings as well.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI like this gel eye cream. It feels soothing and cool on your skin. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not my favorite brand but I like it.\\r\\nWhile I do like this eye cream just fine, I feel that I\\'ve definitely tried more moisturizing eye creams. I got a sample, which is a good size, however I don\\'t think I will be purchasing.\\r\\nI like this eye cream and I think it has made my undereyes feel nice and moisturized\\r\\nLove this eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s creamy and hydrating. Sometimes it can feel too rich to use in the mornings.\\r\\nVery nice and moisturizing. No fragrance and gentle on sensitive skin. My under eyes go back and forth between dry and oily and it\\'s worked great for me with both\\r\\nThis is very hydrating eye gel.it is ultra cooling a d helps to take away puffiness.  When you use in evening can see a difference in morning eyes look vibrant\\r\\nThis is a really nice eye cream. It has an emollient texture on the thicker side that works nicely to plump fine lines for mature skin. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great under makeup, so a perfect choice for a daytime skin care routine. But most people will find it rich enough for nighttime, too. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sort of the Goldilocks of eye creams for me: Just right.\\r\\nThis is soooo great! My favorite eye cream! It is super moisturizing and great during the winter months. Not too thick where it weighs down your eyes, but no too thin where it seems like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing nothing. I really love this product and it is definitely worth the splurge. I absolutely love it!! :))\\r\\nThis smells so amazing I want to rub it all over my body but......... it makes my eyes water after it put it on. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very careful not to get it in my eyes but they still water... it must be something in the formula that my eyes don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agree with.\\r\\nThis is so nice around the eyes, keeping them hydrated and refreshed while combatting darkness and puffiness.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis is hands down my current favorite obsession for the past 2 months. The consistency is beyond perfect! It feels so good on the eyes. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t burn or irritate. Really hydrates the eyes and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect for prepping the eyes before makeup. And it smells amazinnngggg!!!!\\r\\nI got this sample from Ipsy and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in love with it. It goes on so smooth and it smells so good. I use it day and night. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed that when I wear it under my make concealer it helps it stay longer! This cream is not cheap but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m definitely buying the regular size.\\r\\nI have really sensitive under eyes but this product is really gentle and hydrating.  I like it a lot to use in the morning time to help with any puffiness and dryness that can happen overnight.  It also helped to ease the small bumps I was getting under my eye.\\r\\nHas a very nice cooling affect. Perfect for those who have puffiness under eye. Hydrating and very soothing.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI have never really found an eye cream I liked before this because I felt like they were all too heavy, but this one is perfect. It\\'s moisturizing and hydrating without feeling oily or heavy under the eyes. Use it every night and in the mornings ad it makes my undereye concealer sit better on my skin.\\r\\nBest eye cream I use this in the morning to get rid of my puff under eyes and it works every time also creates a smooth base for ur makeup in the morning. No creasing!\\r\\nLove love love this eye cream. It came in my Ipsy bag and made a huge difference for my tired looking eyes. I already ordered a full size.\\r\\nI have never used a eye cream like this one. The gel consistency is sooo hydrating and it feels amazing applying it\\r\\nThe best eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super moisturizing but also sinks in to the skin completely. It makes my eyes look brighter and healthy. A little goes a long way! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be using this for a long time\\r\\nThis eye cream is great to go along with the Belif Aqua Bomb. It is gentle but moisturizing enough to properly hydrate the under eyes. I feel like it ever so slightly de puffs and feels cooling, which is perfect for the morning. Overall it is a good eye cream and I would repurchase!\\r\\nVery hydrating eye mask. Love using it with the other belif products. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave a sticky residue at all. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t speak to the effectiveness removing wrinkles etc because i haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been using it long enough\\r\\nHonestly not a huge fan of this eye cream. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have sensitive skin but It kind of burns??\\r\\nOmg my undereyes are always incredibly parched, and I have tried more eyecreams and eye moisturizers than I can count! The last one that I tried was the Aquabomb. I received it as a sample in a sub box a couple months ago, and it is THE ONE! Gives my undereye area SERIOUS hydration! It is very lightweight, not oily or greasy feeling AT ALL, has almost no scent to it, looks smells and feels very pure and \"organic\" and my skin just soaks it up and loves it! I also have EXTREMELY SENSITIVE skin on my face; even products that advertise as being hypoallergenic, sensitive, etc, will still badly irritate my face..But not the Aquabomb! I would recommend this product to the whole world! And the price is more than affordable as well as SO worth it! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb \\r\\nWorks well so far, I have only used a handful of times but so far so good I haven\\'t noticed any major improvements other than it seems a bit more moisturized when I wake up in the AM, but again I just started using this and have zero complaints thus far (:\\r\\nI can\\'t really tell if this does anything. I mean, it feels nice going on and I can\\'t say it\\'s making anything WORSE but I don\\'t really notice any difference between using this and just using a regular moisturizer. For the price, I don\\'t think it\\'s worth it, unless you just want to treat yourself.\\r\\nThis stuff is so yummy! Goes on so smooth and feel very cooling. It feels like cool moisture soaking in immediately. Love it!\\r\\nWow I received this sample in the mail and I absolutely love it.  Went straight online to see where to but it. My eyes feel sooooo good after applying it.\\r\\nAn amazing eye cream for under concealer as it is so light weight and moisturizes the under eyes like no other. I have sensitive skin and this product does not burn around my eyes.  One jar lasts months and I will be buying this product again!!\\r\\nGot a sample in one of my subscription boxes, and just kinda sat on it until a friend of mine was raving about it. So I finally whipped it out and was blown away. Very light-weight, perfect under makeup, absorbs quickly. Very delicate fragrance that I enjoy sooooo much. Smells the same as their True Cream Aqua Bomb, I love using them together as part of my daytime routine. A little goes a long way so it\\'s a great value.\\r\\nAbsolute favorite eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so moisturizing and feels so light. I have eczema and I used to get dry patches around my eyes, but since using this the last year, I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t experienced any dry patches! I highly recommend.\\r\\nLOVE IT. The texture is so creamy and thick, yet it soaks in instantly like a gel. My dark circles and wrinkles are smoothing out and the skin feels super soft and hydrated. More than exceeded my expectations\\r\\nThis eye cram has a thick consistency in which I like to have for using at night. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydrated and in the morning I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wake up with puffy eyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good value for this eye cream which last me long.\\r\\nDoes a pretty good job with moisturizing under the eyes. I would use this product more at night because being oily/combo skin it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sit well under my makeup. Nice and clean scent, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate skin.\\r\\nI love this cream! It feels very hydrating without feeling heavy or oily.  It keeps my under eye area hydrated all day and doesn\\'t look bad under makeup.\\r\\nAwesome scent, great results. Gave extra minis to relatives and they like it as well. A little price but I Eye the minis in Ipsy so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a happy camper. I recommend at least trying a mini of their eye bomb.\\r\\nLove how hydrating and lightweight this eye cream is. Does a lot to keep my eye area looking fresh and rested, but does little for the swelling or size of my eye bags when I have been lacking sleep. Wish the container opening was a little wider, makes it difficult to scoop product out.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI liked this product. I received it as a complementary gift from Influenster. It absorbs fast. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice any results.\\r\\nI love love love this eye cream! I use this on top of my murad retinol eye serum so that I can moisturizer my under eyes and it just does a great job! A little goes a long ways. Price isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bad for a high end eye cream. Smell isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bad. Highly recommend! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already repurchase!\\r\\nGreat and hydrating that sunk it immediately and make my eyes feel great had looked very alert and clear\\r\\nI have been using this product for a few months and don\\'t really see that it has made that much difference. However, it does help to hydrate under my eyes during the winter months when I tend to have much dryer skin.\\r\\nThis is my every day eye cream.  It is very hydrating.  A jar will last a really long time, as a small amount is enough.  They somehow managed to make something that provides long lasting hydration while being light.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this since it launched.\\r\\nThis eye cram has a thick consistency in which I like to have for using at night.

I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this since it launched.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried many eye creams but I always come back to this one. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on my third jar. It gives the best moisture to my eyes without being greasy. It works great under makeup because the hydration seems to plump out some of my fine lines.\\r\\nIt works just fine. Got it with my beauty insider reward pts. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite seen any difference with my eyes.. not that I ever pay much attention to it? The smell is pleasant and not over powering. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want anything too heavy on your eyes and this is that product\\r\\nThis is a pretty great, hydrating, eye cream. I use it during the day because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more of a gel, and isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too heavy for day use.\\r\\nYoutuber told me about this one constantly and i finally saved up for it and it is totally worth it. Every under eye cream has had me have millia over and over and i stopped using for a few months and it went away and was skeptical on trying this. It sinks in right away and give enough hydration that you need. I feel over time it will help with wrinkles as well!\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an ok product. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice any drastic changes to my under eye area after a few weeks of use. It keeps the area hydrated but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything to firm it.\\r\\nI got this in a subscription box and was super excited because  is my favorite moisturizer ever. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been testing out this eye cream and I love it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydrating, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too thick where you cannot wear it under makeup. It feels so good when applied too, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of thin and spreads easily and absorbs really well.\\r\\nI got this product as a sample and fell in love with this eye cream. I really enjoy hydrating eye creams and if you do too this will be your best friend. This product is very light on your face too. I would definitely recommend this product to people with dry to normal skin.\\r\\nThis eye cream is awesome! Very moisturizing but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel greasy. Highly recommend.\\r\\nI got this from a beauty box in a sample size. I liked it, and I would buy it again if I found it on sale. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I would pay full price for it. Nothing revolutionary, just a pretty good eye cream.\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nI think this is a decent eye cream and totally understand why it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so popular. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just not necessarily my favorite.  These days I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m more on the hunt for skincare that has a heavy anti-aging focus, this doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really.  However it is extremely hydrating and applies beautifully.  If that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all you are needing at this point in time I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d definitely recommend it.\\r\\nI really like this eye cream. I have a couple of the sample sizes and I will be looking into a full size once I finish up what I have. It is very moisturizing and it works well for me.\\r\\nAre use this on my eyes at night when they are feeling particularly dry. It does feel like a heavy heavy night cream more than anything else. It is hydrating but I do feel like an eye serum would be more beneficial in terms of brightening dark circles or reducing bags.\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nBest eye cream make your eyes refresh and absorb easily no sticky feeling little goes a long way\\r\\nI love this eye cream so much!!! I love the consistency and how it feels so delicate and nice under my eye. I use this for baking too under my eyes and it works out perfect. This is worth the money!!\\r\\nI love this eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moisturizing without being thick or heavy. It sinks in quickly and can be used in the morning and evening. I have had many samples of this and need to eventually buy them.\\r\\nI\\'m really liking this eye cream. It is a very light formula and does have a slight perfume scent to it. Of you dont like a perfumey scent in your eye cream, I\\'d stay away from this one. If you dont mind it, it is nice. This leaves my eye area hydrated for quite some time. I like it under my makeup. It really does work great of you need moisture under your eyes.\\r\\nMoisture! Moisture! Moisture! My under eye area was Mojave dry and this eye cream saved it. The tub is a pretty blue, I just wish it came with a spatula. It is wonderfully effective, though I do still have issues with dark circles. Maybe a later formulation will better address that.\\r\\nLove this for super dry undereyes. I use this in my professional kit, and I also use some myself when my eyelids are windburnt from walking my dogs in the harsh Chicago winter.  Takes a bit to absorb but goes on super smooth.\\r\\nSuper gentle, bouncy gel cream absorbs without any residue and is perfect for day or night use. Really refreshes, brightens, and moisturizes the delicate eye area. Soothes dryness and irritation, too.\\r\\nBelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is so soft and gentle when applying it to the delicate under eye. I use it in the morning and at night. I have noticed my wrinkles are less defined. Also my skin is tighter and brighter. I highly recommend this product.  I loved this wonderful eye cream. The formula provides 26 hour of extreme moisture to the eye area and improving the overall appearance. @belif #Belif @reesetisha  #reesetishas2cents Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb Sample Packet (3Ml /0.10 Fl.Oz)\\r\\nThis eye bomb definitely keeps your eye area hydrated, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cool and has a silk texture when you out it on. Only thing is, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure if it help prevents wrinkles or anything!\\r\\nLove using this under my eyes for puffiness and my circles. Usually eye moisturizers like this do not work but this one made me look and feel good!\\r\\nI have used this for 3 months and have noticed a huge difference in the dark circles around my eyes. I got a travel size of this, and has to buy the big size. Love the smell and doesn\\'t burn.\\r\\nthis is one of the few eye skincare products that i will use. typically, any cream i apply around the eye makes them burn or tear up due to very thin skin in that area on my face as i use retinoid-based products to exfoliate the skin. i love, love this eye bomb\\r\\nOne of my top 5 favorite eye creams. It is super lightweight for day and night and helps my under eye bags stay plump throughout the day. I love the thin consistency. It produces me with hydration and a smooth base for undereye concealers I have a little baby sample jar that literally lasts forever. A little goes a long way with this product. The scent is very mild. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dry or need help with creasing, I think this is a super helpful product.\\r\\nThis stuff is super! I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the most noticeably de-puffing of all the eye creams I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried so far. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extra moisturizing and it feels super going on, especially when I put it in my skincare fridge first!\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hydrating but couldnt really see a noticeable difference. I like bright under eyes and this didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much for brightening. It did make under my eyes soft and plump\\r\\nI was having an issue with dry under eyes and picked this up and it immediately helped! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lasted forever and isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too pricey compared to other eye creams. Recommend!\\r\\nEs un buen producto para humectar el \\xc3\\xa1rea de los ojos, f\\xc3\\xa1cil de aplicar, ideal para todo tipo de piel, porque ha sido utilizado por mi primo que tiene piel grasa y yo tengo piel seca, y hemos visto buenos resultados para hidratar\\r\\nThis is a good eye cream but the price is very high. It just hydrates my skin like a basic cream and does not cause any under eye milia, which I do get easily. The amount of product needed isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t much. This cream does have a scent and it is light and fresh. I have hereditary dark circles that can only be helped with sleep so I am unsure of the effectiveness for dark circles.\\r\\nI love this eye cream it\\'s my favorite one it\\'s so hydrating it\\'s kind of sick but I like that I very dry skin specialist under my eyes so I always like to wear this eye cream under makeup\\r\\nIt feels nice under the eyes, and it hydrates the area overnight. Glides on well. Kind of pricey though :/\\r\\nExcellent eye cream! Has a cool feeling when first applied and keeps under my eyes moisturized all day and night. I use it every night and occasionally in the mornings. Not too heavy but you can definitely feel that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it there and tell it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s working!\\r\\nThis moisturizer is truely a bomb!!! Absolutely fascinating. My skin around eyes is too dry and I have always had problems with moisturizing. Since I have found it my problem has dissapeares. More than highly recommended!\\r\\nGreat eye cream!  It feels so cool and soothing on the skin and a little goes a long way on this.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a favorite of mine\\r\\nGreat product. Lightweight and moisturizing. Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any brightening effect like the ole eye cream. If you want a gentle moisturizing eye cream look no further .\\r\\nThis is pretty good, it is a gel eye cream and feels really hydrating when you apply. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the most moisturizing eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used but it does the job. There are other eye creams that I prefer over this so while I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s acceptable, I probably won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t repurchase.\\r\\nThis is a lightweight gel like eye cream. While I like belif products, this one wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t my favorite. Not for those who are looking for extra care for the eyes.\\r\\nI love this so much I thought eye creams where useless I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d just bring my moisturizer up but this feels so nice\\r\\nI\\'ve been enjoying this eye cream! I has something in it that gives my under eyes a little tingle- I dont know if that does anything but I enjoy the sensation. My favorite way to use this cream in the day when my under eyes are a bit dry so I\\'ll apply this and it helps my makeup application\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think this made the skin around my eyes feel any more hydrated. It definitely took a long time to dry down and it stayed tacky longer than I would have liked.\\r\\nI find this is hydrating. Good price for eye cream. Would prefer a tube over jar. Would buy again.\\r\\nLove this! Extremely hydrating for under eyes. Haven\\'t found anything that compares, even at Neman Marcus!\\r\\nOne of my favourite eye creams I have ever tried. I love it for morning and night but I find I mostly use it in the morning size it isn\\'t heavy at all, is super hydrating, and I find it brightening. This is not expensive either for an eye cream and how much you get.\\xc2\\xa0 belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb \\r\\nI love trying different eye cream and I use this one daily. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go on too thick and I feel like it really helps me look not as tired as I sometimes am.\\r\\nTruthfully one of, if not, the best eye bomb I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used. As the name says, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a moisturizing bomb with moisture being the primary goal. I have been struggling with dryness under the eyes which leads to increased lines and wrinkles, puffiness and just heavy looking bags. This has helped combat all of that. The only thing it hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t touched on is dark circles which is almost impossible to do being THEYRE genetic. I will continue to repurchase this product\\r\\nI love the first Belif products that I tried was thanks to Influenster and I loved them! so buy this moisturizing for the eyes and love it too! I love its texture and how easy it is absorbed in my skin, it leaves my skin very hydrated and I feel my eyes more rested and it gives a freshness to my face, I recommend it!\\r\\nI love love love Belif!! The eye bomb depuffs and smooths under the eye. It helps especially when I\\'m already tired, I won\\'t look it. And a little goes a long way, so even a sample size will last a good period of time!\\r\\nThis is my absolute favorite eye cream of all time! Nothing feels as refreshing, moisturizing and smooth, and this makes my undereyes immediately look brighter!\\r\\nI love the smell and texture of this product. It goes on smoothly, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s instantly cooling! I definitely notice a difference after I use this product. I typically use it day and night and find it works well.\\r\\nReally enjoy this product. Makes my under eyes feel refreshed and helps with my dark circles.\\r\\nThis eye cream is so nice! Its super moisturizing and has lasting power. It just makes your under eyes smooth and takes all the dryness away!\\r\\nI love this cream! I feel comfortable using it close to my eyes, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gentle. I only need to use a little bit which is amazing. No harsh smells either which is great using it in public and overnight. Definitely have recommended it to family before!\\r\\nHelps with dark circles under eyes. I used it for a week and my dark eyes were gone that week. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too thick or thin\\r\\nI love k beauty and specially Belif! This eye cream in specific helps me keep my eyes hydrated. I give it fous stars Since the formula is too watery for me\\xef\\xbf\\xbc\\r\\nThis is by far the best eye cream I have ever used. It is so hydrating, yet light under the eyes! I love them smell too!!!\\r\\nThis eye cream is thick and moisturizing, it really hydrates and brightens up my eyes. I feel like it reduces dark circles which I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say for other eye creams I have tried. I now include this in my daily routine.\\r\\nI love all of the belif skincare products and this is no exception. Other than Lancome, I rarely like the eye cream that accompanies that brand\\'s face cream. I tend to have very sensitive skin around the eye area and this cream has never been irritating. If anything, it helps reduces puffiness or irritation from makeup.  It\\'s a great value at the price point. \\r\\nGreat under eye cream. Very moisturizing and light. I tried Belif skin care products, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve lived them so much. When I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what to get, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll always come back to old buddy because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Amazing.\\r\\nThis eye bomb felt very thick and heavy and some people may like that but it just isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t what I look for. I prefer something that melts into the skin\\r\\nLove using this eye cream every day and i use it religiously before going to bed each night. Keeps my skin very hydrated and dewy\\r\\nI love this eye cream to be honest. It\\'s so nice, rich and creamy plus it feel really nice on the skin. It\\'s not too heavy and it feels very cooling. It didn\\'t make my skin oily but it did hydrate my undereye enough.  I love it, I use it day and night. I would definitely recommend to others\\r\\nThis stuff is amazing and I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as popular as it deserves to be. It removes my dark circles, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t slimy feeling on your face and leaves my skin as velvety as the cream when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in the jar. Definitely an A+!\\r\\nI am on my second jar of this for my nightly eye cream. It does not irritate my eye region at all, and is so great!\\r\\nYou will be in love with this eye bomb. The texture is amazingly silky and you can feel it absorb and lighten your eyes. A little goes a long way and this stuff lasts forever!\\r\\nThis is 1 of the best eye creams I have tried so far.  Love all of the products I have tried from Belif. Good moisturizer and soaks right in. I dont have wrinkles or dark circles so cant say how it works for them...\\r\\nThis eye cream is super hydrating. The skin absorbs the cream immediately. There is almost a cooling sensation from it.\\r\\nMy eyes are not as puffy and the dark circles and fine lines almost disappered. The smell is great. Helps my makeup go on better.\\r\\nSO MUCH SILICONE that after a few days of use it made the wrinkles around my eyes WORSE. It caused my concealer to crease and I couldn\\'t go anywhere near my eyes with powder. It took a couple of weeks to eliminate the dryness and my skin never really recovered from the wrinkles. DO YOUR RESEARCH and avoid silicones around your eyes! They form an occlusive barrier and dry you out!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nPerfect to use under your eyes to keep that area moist and hydrated! Super light weight and you can use during the day and right before you sleep. Does not leave your skin sticky but this is not water base like how the sleeping mask is.\\r\\nTied for my favorite eye cream.  Need such a small amount and eye area feels amazing and moisturized.  Highly recommend.\\r\\nI was hesitant when I first heard of this, for the price I was iffy. But man this changed the game for me. My under eyes are so moisturized and soft I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t belif it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve bought a few bottles and will continue repurchasing.\\r\\nI\\'ve received this undereye moisturizer probably a dozen times from different subscription boxes and I\\'m a fan! I use it on both the undereye and lid areas before bed and before applying makeup and it keeps those areas from feeling dry and helps under eye makeup apply smoothly. I\\'d recommend you give it a try!\\r\\nFor the amount of product and the price, I feel like this is a good value. I did think that it moisturized my skin well but I did not notice a difference with elasticity. I usually prefer eye creams that also brighten and minimized wrinkles, so I don\\'t think I will be repurchasing this. If you are only looking for something that is moisturizing though, it is a good product. \\r\\nthis  product moisturizing skin under eye very good\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x99                                                                      its very effective dor my  dry skin.    i recomend it\\r\\nThis is an amazing eye gel.  Absorbs quickly, restores moisture quickly and does the dishes when it\\'s done.  Ok, maybe not the dishes, but it does the job and then some.  It\\'s one of my absolute favorites and I highly recommend this product to others.\\r\\nI love this eye cream so much. I got it as a sample and it was amazing but I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring myself to purchase because of the high price tag.\\r\\nOMG IT\\'S SO GOOD. It\\'s honestly so cooling to the eyes. In a good way, it\\'s a light cream that doesn\\'t suffocate the under eyes. In addition to it\\'s post-application cooling effect, it\\'s really hydrating and smells really fresh like some fresh grass herb.\\r\\nThe best combination is this product with the belief moisturizer. My skin has completely transformed since I got it. Recommend this!\\r\\nI just started using this.\\xc2\\xa0 I received a small version through a subscription box.\\xc2\\xa0 It is really lasting a while, which is great as I can judge over a period of time if it is indeed helping.\\xc2\\xa0 I have extremely dry under-eyes, so if this helps it will be a miracle worker.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI usually only get this in sample form because my money goes to the aqua bomb, the moisturizer and the cleanser. HOWEVER: even the littlest jar of this goes a long way and really helps my under eyes. 100/10.\\r\\nThis stuff is good.\\xc2\\xa0 Though I did not see significant improvement, it really does plump up the skin and leaves it hydrated. I would only recommend for nighttime use, as it\\'s too thick/too much for day and could not be worn under makeup. Belif does eye creams well.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nGreat brand and a great product. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t usually use eye cream/moisturizers but this one is great! It does help with darkness around the eye and gives you a refreshed look. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d buy it again. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d recommend it!\\r\\nWow!! I am in my kid 30\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and have some fine lines under my eyes and crows feet. My left eyes crow is much more noticeable than the right. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been searching for an eye treatment that will plump up those lines for longer than an hour or two. I was immediately impressed with this product!! My skin was soft, moisturizer but not greasy or shiny. My lines appeared filled in 12 hours after applying. Will continue using this for sure\\r\\nThis is a very moisturizing eye cream while still absorbing quickly. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much for dark circles, but that isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t one of my bigger problems. It is very hydrating but still works well under makeup. I have very sensitive skin under my eyes and this didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cause any negative reactions at all.\\r\\nReally refreshing cream, keeps my undereye really hydrated and it last a long time. I would like the cream to have less fragance but feels nice on skin\\r\\nAfter trying the moisturizer I had to get their eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pricey but it works well! Saw a movie improvement immediately. It also lasts me a while so I can justify the price. The packaging is a little heavy on the plastic. I would love to see them condense the size of the container.\\r\\nA go to eye cream for me.\\xc2\\xa0 It is creamy but after it sets into the skin is not greasy and does not separate makeup on the face.\\xc2\\xa0 It truly feels so hydrating on the gentle skin around the eyes.\\xc2\\xa0 I especially like to use this product at night time but works during the day as well\\r\\nThis was the first eye cream I have ever used - so I do not have much to compare it to - however I love it! It has a cooling effect that is great for the mornings and leaves my under eyes feeling refreshed. I have noticed slight change over time in the brightness of my under eye area! I think comparable to other brands the price is right as well. Would recommend!\\r\\nAmazing eye cream! I often suffer with puffy eyes with dark circles and this cream has helped these issues and absorbed well into the skin! I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t experience any breakouts or eye stinging. Plus, the cream is slightly cooling!\\r\\nLove this one from belif. Light weight, high moisturizing, fast absorbing - essentials in an eye cream (a side note: I don\\'t expect any of my eye cream to do more than hydration)\\r\\nThis is literally the bomb when it comes to keeping your under eyes hydrated. I\\'ve used this product since it first came out and I will keep repurchasing!\\r\\nI wanted to love this SO BADLY, but alas, it was giving me milia too, which is also what I read from other reviews. The light, cooling, and refreshing gel feels absolutely amazing going on, but it also made my lids feel a little too slick during the day - heads up to my oily lid friends.  I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have particularly sensitive skin, but when that first clogged follicle/pore showed up on my eyelid margin during the week of using this, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t continue forward with it.\\r\\nVery moisturizing! I usually use this product during the day to moisturize the skin under my eye and prevent creasing!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI love dabbing this eye cream on before I go to bed. It really helps keep the skin around my eyes moisturized and bright, especially during fun the harsh winter months.\\r\\nI really enjoy this eye cream and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been through a whole one so I feel like I truly \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknow\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it, for the price and the amount you get, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t beat it. In reality, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all that special, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of what I like too, just something simple that does the job. The only thing I noticed that was negative was that you need to be careful with how much you apply because it can pill up a little bit.\\r\\nI got this as an add on from ipsy. I use it daily as an under eye moisturizer. It works very well. I have dry skin and this keeps my under eyes hydrated.\\r\\nDefinitely very moisturizing like it says but it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much for my dark eyes; and as a mom; I definitely need an eye dream that will help me not look like a mom who hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t slept in 2 years. If your eyelids/eye area is dry, this is a good eye cream; but if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for something to help dark circles, this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it.\\r\\nI usually wake up with bags under my eyes. Not with this under eye cream. It goes on light and absorbs well into my skin. 10 /10 would recommend.\\r\\nGot a sample size in one of my subscription boxes. It is a nice under eye moisturizer. My biggest skin concern is dryness, but usually my moisturizer does good job as well.\\r\\nGot this as a sample in an ipsy bag and fell in love with it. A little goes a long way and it definitely keeps my eye area hydrated in winter. I would recommend anyone with dry skin try this in the 5mL version before committing to the larger version as that bottle lasted me 6months\\r\\nThis eye cream delivers rich, potent moisture without feeling greasy, and a little bit goes a long way. It also did not irritate my sensitive skin. This product is well worth the money.\\xc2\\xa0 belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb \\r\\nGot a sample of this and only used it 2 times now. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m starting to get into eye creams and this is the first product that I was able to try. This smells wonderful just like the aqua bomb. It does a great job at moisturizing my under eyes which is why I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m thinking about purchasing the full size.\\r\\nSuper hydrating eye cream. Lightweight formula smooths under eye wrinkles and gives a healthier, more awake look to the eyes. Super gentle and safe for all skin types. Ideal for any clients looking for a little under eye pick me up!\\r\\nOne of my faves! Purchased full-size and has a lot of product! My under eyes are not crepey when I wear my makeup and I do think this has helped retain the moisture. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pricey but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d recommend. Skincare is worth the markup whereas makeup is not necessarily, I am loving my drugstore over my high end makeup products.\\r\\nThis eye cream is pretty decent. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think there is much to write home about aside from it being moisturizing but it does exactly just that, moisturize. This didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help my dark circles but it did make my under eye area a lot more moisturized.\\r\\nAbsolute best eye cream! Not sticky, lays perfectly under makeup, and absolutely worth the higher price point!\\r\\nI love this moisturizing eye bomb! It immediately made my eyelids feel so hydrated and the hydration lasts all day and night\\r\\nI\\'ve been using this eye cream for 3 years now and absolutely love it!!  Super moisturizing and great to use in the morning under concealer.  [product:belif-moisturizing-eye-bomb]\\r\\nThis stuff is amazing! Not greasy super hydrating. It smells and feels nice my only complaint is that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little pricey but a little goes a long way so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth it\\r\\nVery moisturizing but is no better than the moisturizing cream from Belif. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d recommend just getting that and putting a little extra around your eyes\\r\\nThe best eye cream for extremely dry eye area. I use it in the dry and frigid winter months - it is the only thing that works for me in the windy depths of northeast winter. Highly recommend.\\r\\nAmazing. Love the smell. Formula is great, and effective. A little pricey, but worth it.\\r\\nTalk about moisturizing!!! I LOVE this product! As a teacher, I feel like I always have tired eyes and when I put this on - it gives life back to my under eyes \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d\\r\\nFantastic eye cream! This cream is refreshing and just thick enough for nighttime wear. I love to apply this and watch my eye area look instantly brighter.\\r\\nReally want to love it seeing how a lot of people hype about it. But it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work for me for some reason, I applied it at night and I tried to even put a lot more on to see if it actually made a difference. Sadly no, my eyes weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t moisturizing, pretty dry in fact.\\r\\nI love all of the belif products. You just need a little dab of it and man does it work. I have dry skin and use it 2x a week.\\r\\nThis is the most hydrating eye mask you can find. I use it morning and night. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing!\\r\\nReceived this in my ipsy bag.\\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0I find it to be light and works pretty well to keep my under eye area moisturized throughout the day.\\xc2\\xa0 It has a nice lemony scent that while strong is not unpleasant.\\xc2\\xa0 I would definitely purchase this again.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis eye cream is very moisturizing and a good de puffer! I like to use it at night before bed to avoid puffy eyes in the morning! My only critique is that it is on the more expensive side. I highly recommend if you want to splurge.\\r\\nVery moisturizing but is no better than the moisturizing cream from Belif.

I highly recommend if you want to splurge.\\r\\nAfter getting this as a sample from ipsy, I fell in love. This is my everyday morning and night eye cream now, replaced by a retinol twice a week.\\r\\nThis product is super hydrating and great for under eyes! I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice a huge change in the appearance of fine lines, but my skin felt well moisturized. It was gentle and seemed to soak into my skin.\\r\\nBest eye cream ever! Leaves the driest skin feeling moisturized!! I love for this stuff\\r\\nProbably the most hydrating eye cream you can get! Love this stuff and love the smell\\r\\nGreat day eye moisturizer! It works really well with or without makeup. It adds great hydration and smooths the under eye. Its still not as comparable to some night eye creams but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect for day use. Also the size of the container is huge! 25ml the standard is usually 15ml. Love it!\\r\\nThis product is small but mighty! I have terrible dry under eyes and I noticed when I used this my concealer and powder (to set) applied so much nicer the next day! I usually apply this at night to receive the maximum benefits.\\r\\nThis was an okay eye cream, I had heard so many great things about it, I think I was expecting more. I didn\\'t see what the hype was all about. I think it\\'s an over priced eye cream.\\r\\nI love this product. It definitely helped with the puffiness around my eyes. It feels great, very light and doesn\\'t make your eyes feel heavy.\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my new fav. I feel like I saw a difference after a couple uses\\r\\nThis eye cream was very hydrating and not to heavy under my eyes. There was no scent and did not irritate under my eyes. I never noticed any huge improvement with my under eyes and I think that it was overpriced. I think that belif has much better products than this eye cream\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like adding gallons of water under your eyes. I always find that I wake up very refreshed and and hydrated specially if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to use a dry concealer like shape tape\\r\\nSo far I am liking the product but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know long term how effective it has been. My under eyes aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as dry as they were, but I feel that throughout the day it wears off relatively quickly compared to other eye creams in this price range.\\r\\nReally bomb,works well, smooth, love smell, not bothering, good value, good over night, would recomend,i get it in ipsy and love it\\r\\nGreat eye cream for super hydration. Does not irritate my sensitive eyes at all. I\\'ve purchased one jar so far and it seems to have no end to the jar.\\r\\nI have young sceen and right now my under eye skin doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need special care, but for future to avoid wrinkles and fine lines I started to moisturize them. I like Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. Right now I am happy to using it.\\r\\nWow! This is an eye gel that I find myself reaching for every night. It is a nice texture, moisturizes great, and has a good smell. I apply this every night and sometimes before I apply make up. It has kept my under eyes hydrated and looking youthful! Love this!\\r\\nI recently received this in my Ipsy bag and omg. Best eye cream for under makeup ever! It absorbs quickly making my concealer just glide under my eyes. The eye area feels plump and soft and moisturized. Even my concealer won\\'t crease as much when I use this. I feel this is good for night time use although I like my night eye creams to be more heavy.\\r\\nLove the smell of this product. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for nighttime use and helps me wake up looking more refreshed and less tired. A little bit goes a long way. So while the container may be small, it should last you a while.\\r\\nI have such sensitive eyes and there have been creams I love the result of, but they make my eyes burn or cause milia bumps. This cream is light, but still very hydrating. It absorbs quickly which is great especially for wearing makeup. I noticed a difference in the hydration of my under eyes within 3-4 days of using morning and night.\\r\\nThis is a slightly thick eye moisturizer so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best to be used at nighttime but it can work during the day if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not planning on applying makeup right away. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super moisturizing and cool to the skin.\\r\\nIt feels very light on skin, it has a nice scent. It leaves my under eye feeling cool for some reason, I recommend this product if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on your 20\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nThis is a pretty good eye cream. It had the same signature scent of the aqua bomb. I apply a thin layer all over my under eye and lid every night before bed. It definitely moisturizes but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not 100% sure about what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing for me. But the best methods of skincare are preventative!\\r\\nThis eye cream is super hydrating under the eyes. You use so little that it a great value. I love the gel water texture and my skin absorbed it so well and the eye remains hydrated all day.\\r\\nThis is my favorite hydrating eye cream!! It is the only product I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found that gives my dry under eyes all the hydration they need which also improves my dark circles. The product is a mixture between a gel and cream in texture and has a very cooling soothing effect. It smells great also! I use this product in the morning and evening to get these benefits. I would definitely recommend!\\r\\nI adore this eye cream. It absorbs quickly which makes it easier to apply my moisturizer on top without displacing it. The texture is kind of a gel-cream hybrid. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cooling and it really does soften my fine lines. I will definitely be purchasing the full size.\\r\\nDoesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help my hereditary dark circles but it does leave my skin soft and hydrated.\\r\\nThis is my favorite eye cream by far. It helps keep my under eyes refreshed and brings new life to them. It feels cooling, even without having to put it in the fridge.\\r\\nI love how this leaves my skin feeling dewy. It does not irritate my sensitive eyes. It does not help along with tiredness but it great under makeup.\\r\\nThis eye cream is nice and lightly moisturizing. I love the gel texture. I was having an issue with milia before I started using this product, but once I switched to this, it cleared up. My under eyes still feel moisturized but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still light!\\r\\nReally liked this eye cream in a first moment, though I find it too heavy even for my dry eye area. The price point is great though.\\r\\nI have dryer under eyes and this eye cream is one of the best I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever tried. It gives you 72 hrs of hydration under the eye. Also belif is an all natural brand as well.\\r\\nI recieved the velof, moisturizing eye cream as a sample in my topbox and will definitely be adding it into my daily face care routine. I can already see the results after using it for a week\\r\\nNice hydrating eye cream. Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything extra like brighten or reduce wrinkles but it does a good job of what it advertises which is moisture\\r\\nMoisturizing indeed. This lightweight eye cream is wonderful. No residue, absorbs quickly and leaves the eye area looking refreshed. No sleepy eyes here! The cream is formulated so that a little goes a long way. Definitely a solid investment for the price.\\r\\nThis is my one and only product for eyes. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it regularly. Only one or two times in a week. It has thin consistence and feel very nice after applying.\\r\\nThis stuff is so good especially if your undereye is super dry like mine i like it because its not irritating and it gets the job done it doesn\\'t make my concealer crease.\\r\\nI initially liked this stuff alright. Still probably not worth the buy (I got this in my ipsy bag). After a week or two though, my under eyes were a mess. Dry, creased, and I had a bunch of milia which I don\\'t usually have. It didn\\'t help my dark circles at all. Definitely went way downhill.\\r\\nThis is my absolute holy grail eye cream and I will never stop using it!!! I have these weird lines under my eyes from a severe allergic reaction I had years ago, and now without a hydrating eye cream, they look so cracky under makeup. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried so many popular, highly rated ones and the only thing that worked before was the Kiehls Creamy Avocado which I used for years, but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t love the consistency. But omg when I found this I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m never looking back. Gel cream is my favourite consistency in products and there is nothing to complains\\r\\nThis Eye Bomb is like magic to me. I use it every night. Even just after one use, my undereyes feel softer and the puffiness was gone the next day. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how I fell in love with it and continued to purchase it. A little goes a long way so it lasts you for months.\\r\\nI received a sample of this product using points from Sephora, and after using it for a week I knew I had to purchase the full size. I normally don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t incorporate an eye cream into my skincare routine, but this is a staple for me now. It totally eliminates puffiness, makes my under eyes super smooth, and prevents creasing from my makeup. The value is long lasting and very much worth the money!\\r\\nJe suis totalement fan de cette marque de soin ! Je les trouves tous parfaits, que ce soit les cr\\xc3\\xa8mes de jour, celles de nuit, celle pour le contour des yeux ! Je vous conseille de vraiment tester ces soins les filles ! Elles font des miracles sur la peau\\r\\nUse this every morning after I take a shower . And cleanse my face. And makes me feel refreshed. And don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have heavy bags under my eyes\\r\\nI received this in my past Ipsy bag. I immediately fell in love with it. It is so moisturizing and sinks into the skin soo well. I am definitely going to be repurchasing it in the future!  This is a new holy grail for my nighttime skin routine. I would definitely recommend this to a friend!\\r\\nSuper refreshing to put on after the shower when your face feel like it needs quenched. I use it on my forehead as well where I have fine lines. LOVE this stuff. Great value.\\r\\nThis is a super light and moisturizing eye cream! Over the winter, I suddenly found my under eyes very dry, to the point where it was slightly flakey. However, after one treatment, my under eyes were rejuvenated again! A little definitely goes a long way with this product. I highly recommend this under eye treatment, especially over the harsh winter!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nLove this product. I got it in my Ipsy bag a few months ago. A little goes a long way so even if you get the sample size it will last a while\\r\\nloving this so far, got a little sample and been using it so sparingly! probably going to repurchase! love\\r\\nLove this eye cream! so hydrating and light! i use this under my makeup and before i sleep. its not stinging my eyes either\\r\\nThis eye cream is great for many reasons. It helps to hydrate and moisturize the area but I also find that it\\'s amazing for taking down puffiness. I have super sensitive and sometimes very dry eyelids and using this eye cream you immediately see the swelling go down. I recommend this for anyone who needs hydration and depuffing\\r\\nThis has been a lifesaver for my dry under eyes. For the longest time my eyes would look crepey underneath no.matter what I used and this smoothed, hydrated and plumped under my eyes for the day without re application. I would buy this product again.\\r\\nThis stuff is awesome. I love how a little goes a long way. I got this free as a sample along with some other stuff I purchased and I\\'m so glad I did. Its my new favorite eye cream. Its so hydrating and helps with puffiness and improves fine lines and its lightweight. Makeup goes on great over it.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI love the texture of this a lot! It has a thick gel consistency that feels really plush and hydrating. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to explain. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a runny gel, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a thick cream. I feel like it hydrated so well and sits great under makeup as well if you want to use it during the day. A little goes a long way\\r\\nmy favorite and go to daily eye cream. I\\'m obsessed with the smell of this line. obsessed. I feel refreshed and wide awake once it settles in. the smell alone can do it. moisturizes that delicate area all day and night even!\\r\\nReally love this eye moisturizer! Makes my eye area feel so moisturized and refreshed. This product lasted me for months and I used it to the last drop. I have yet to purchase again but absolutely will\\r\\nThis eyes moisturizer let your eye areas hydrate. You can used before your makeup or for daily used.\\r\\nI love this eye moisturizer it is gentle and I noticed a huge difference in hydration. Skincare is pretty expensive but this ones worth it.\\r\\nI like this product, but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t love it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hydrating, but my biggest issue is that it leaves a sticky/tacky residue that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still present in the morning when you wake up... I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like that feeling.\\r\\nThis is great because it is very light, almost watery but absorbs quickly. It has sort of a lavender scent which is very nice. I feel like my undereye concealer and powder work well over this too. I will take some and dab it on my cheekbones for extra glow after my makeup is done and set.\\r\\nthis is really nothing spectacular but I love it anyway. My main eye concern is moisture, and this provides moisture and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t creep into my eyeballs so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a winner.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis eye cream is super moisturizing! It feels very soothing going on and definitely hydrates the eye area. Only reason I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m taking one star off is I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t love that it has added fragrance and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel like it does anything for fine lines. But overall if you are looking for moisture this will definitely do it for you!\\r\\nThis eye bomb was definitely moisturizing and ALL the works. I tried a sample size from an Ipsy bag that I received, however I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure that I would recommend this because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve read online that comfrey leaf may not be the greatest for humans to be putting on their delicate eye area. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in this moisturizer. There is another main ingredient in there too that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not too sure about. Maybe these ingredients are okay.. I just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to take my chances. I wish I could give this five stars though, because it really was bomb!.\\r\\nThe price of this eye cream saddens me because I genuinely love it so much. It\\'s so hard rating for my dry under eye area and it really gives my under eyes a plumped appearance. I have been using it to daily and have noticed a difference in my under-eye area. It really feels like a drink of water for your under eyes. I wish it was more affordable\\r\\nI love this moisturizing eye balm. I have dry under eyes and this really keeps them hydrated. I highly recommend.\\r\\nThis is a very nice eye cream! Feels nice in the skin and moisturizes very well! Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my eyes at all\\r\\nI love this eye bomb. A small amount goes a long way. It creates a cooling, tingly effect when applied. Really works\\r\\nOkay this product is a true lifesaver! I developed eczema round my eyes last winter and this cleared it up after so many other products failed. I will forever be grateful for this product.\\r\\nI received a sample of this eye cream from Ipsy. I was a little bit apprehensive to try this as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve read a lot of reviews about people getting milia around their eyes. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy that hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happened to me (yet) but I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed a difference around my eyes after about a week of daily use. I will continue to use the sample until it runs out but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I will be purchasing a full size of this.\\r\\nA little goes a long way! I really like the gel consistency of this product. I find that I can dab as little or as much as I want and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go on feeling greasy or oily. It is a bit pricey but considering how little I need, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not surprised that this product is lasting me a long time. It has a light, refreshing smell to it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 nothing too strong.\\r\\nThis ice cream has a really nice texture and blends well underneath the eyes without tugging. It is also super hydrating so that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely a plus! it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any crazy sent either so that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really nice!\\r\\njust as the moisturizing bomb, this works great. but i don;t know how much different it is from it\\'s flagship product (more concentrated?) it was pleasant to use, though im not sure how much it did other than keep my eyelids moisturized.\\r\\nI received this eye cream in my Ipsy Glam Bag Plus Box. I purchased this as a sample as an add-on. I have been using this for ten days twice daily in my skincare regimen. This is such an emollient moisturizer that makes the eye area feel hydrated all day. There is a faint light scent that I enjoy as I do not like scented products, but this is light and lovely. Thus far, this beautiful gel moisturizer is wonderful and the first product I have tried from Belif. I am anxious to see the skincare benefits of this product over time and will purchase the full-sized product in the future. I recommend this eye cream for someone seeking hydration without the oily and greasy feeling.\\r\\nLove it, such a simple hydrating eye cream, I use it once in a while when my eyes are feeling extra dry and this hydrated them right away! Love it keep it handy all the time!\\r\\nA pretty good eye cream! Did make my eyes tear up a bit even though I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it into my actual eyes.\\r\\nThis works well for your under eyes! If you have dry under eyes like me this does work pretty good. I liked it. This is a great brand that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s for sure. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if I would buy this again because it was kinda expensive. But it is good.\\r\\nAbsolutely love this eye bomb! It is the biggest drink you\\'ll ever give your eyes. You only need a little bit and your eyes have moisture all day! Never have you makeup cake or settle into your creases again with this moisturizer \\xe2\\x99\\xa1\\r\\nAn affordable eye cream that helps moisturize the under eye area! This is great for someone that experiences dryness under the eyes and to prevent aging!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy with this product and I would buy it again. Not greasy, lovely under makeup and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sting at all when it goes on. I have huge dark circles, and some hollows, so nothing is going to fix that, but it plumps my undereye and I feel moisturizer. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saving my 5 stars for a miracle under eye dark circle remover from the heavens that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist and maybe never will. Until then 4 is my highest and hard to beat.\\r\\nI reallllly love this eye cream. It is lightweight and feels great on my skin. Very hydrating.\\r\\nReceived this as part of a Belief holiday pack. Will repurchase. Works good. Does a nice job of hydrating the skin around my eyes.\\r\\nOne of the only eye creams that i have used that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my eyes or feel heavy in my skin. This moisturizer quickly absorbs into the skin and leaves my eye area moisturized the next morning. The jar also lasts forever - a little goes a long way so the price is well worth it!\\r\\nThis has a lightweight feel and is very moisturizing. It layered nicely under concealer and did not cause caking.\\r\\nI love Belif and this product is amazing. Leaves you eye area moisturized all day long.\\r\\nNon greasy feel and seems to do a great job hydrating my undereye area. I hope it helps with the fine lines. A bit pricey.\\r\\nIn love with this moisturizer! This moisturizer brings my face back to life and makes it so supple and glow. It does not leave my face sticky after applied. The smell of this product is great. It is not over whelming. Overall I would recommend this product to a friend.\\r\\nThis is extremely moisturizing and soaks quickly into the skin. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave any greasy residue and makes my under eyes look great!\\r\\nLove this eye cream. I received this from my Ipsy subscription as a add on. I use this every morning and night and it reduces the dark puffiness around my eyes. Plan on purchasing the full size.\\r\\nI love this product especially at this price! My undereyes are not in major need or hydration and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have deep dark circles and this is just the right amount of hydration for my skin.\\r\\nBelif  makes beautiful hydrating products. This eye bomb works well in the mornings and under makeup. It leaves the eyes bright and soft.\\r\\nThis is one of the few and only eye creams I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t burn my eye after application. I LOVE IT! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bit pricey but it works and you get your money\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth. It keeps my eye area feeling soft and moistened. A little goes a long way with this!\\r\\nThis is seriously my go to eye cream. There is no other eye cream that I use this is the only one that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used for years. It leaves my under eyes looking nice and hydrated without being greasy and oily\\r\\nI\\'ve only been using this for about a week and I notice such a difference. A little goes a long way with this product! Feels great too\\r\\nKind of irritated my eyes and I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice anything special while using it.  No improvement in wrinkles or fine lines\\r\\nIf you like aqua bomb, you\\'ll like the eye bomb. They are pretty much the same.. Both great. A little bit goes a very long way\\r\\nNice to apply. Nice packaging. Buce scent. Feels nice but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it does anything for my skin\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It relieves puffiness and the appearance of dark circles. It builds really well with the rest of my skincare too.\\r\\nSmooths my under eyes like a dream! Will repurchase. I got this originally as a sample in an Xmas kit, but I love it and have repurchased it a few times now.\\r\\nI love the texture of this eye cream, and how quickly it absorbs. It leaves my under eyes looking plump and hydrated.\\r\\nAll of the products I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve purchased from the Belif line-I absolutely love!  They have also become favorites & repurchases! This is no different & one of my very favorite eye creams! It has a clean, soft scent & creamy texture. Gives great moisture & hydration for hours, melts in right away & feels fabulous on my skin! Perfect for under my concealer & my evening skincare routine. I only apply this around my orbital bones as I have heard from many people that this has caused Milia on their skin. However, this has never been an issue for me.\\r\\nI absolutely love it. I recieve a sample in my ipsy glam bag, just like most of the products i have tried, and i love it. I put it on at night....and i wake up looking like i actually got some sleep.\\r\\nI recieved this product in a deluxe sample size with my August 2019 Ipsy glam bag. Ive been using it for two weeks now and i really like it. My eyes look much better. The dark circles are clearing up and the puffiness going down. I like the packaging. I think its simple but pretty. Quite pricey...i think its possible you could use a cheaper product and get the same results. It feels nice on the skin. Its super lightweight BUT it doesn\\'t dry down that well/fast which ia a bit confusing. I have to make sure i use this as my eye cream and night or only on days that I\\'m not going to do my makeup because even after all my skincare when i get around to applying my concealer and foundation, my under eye is still damp no matter how much i pat and rub.\\r\\nI have eczema and often get it under my eyes and on my eyelids.  Most lotions, eye bombs etc make it worse.  The belif eye bomb is the only product that helps with the eczema and tightens and firms my under eyes.  My dark circles and puffiness had also decreased leaving my eyes looking younger!\\r\\nThis product is amazing. This nourished my under eyes like a dream! It truly does what it says it will! Love it!\\r\\nI love this Marquette I like this product\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8d he is my best Marquette \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x97\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x97 I love it he is a good and perfect \\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8c\\r\\nSo I just started using this and so far it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s working well. My eyes feel moisturized. Hopefully with long term use I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see a difference and stop having creases under foundation \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x81\\r\\nThis product is amazing. I have extreme dry under eyes and when i apply this product in my night time skin care rountine, and when wake up in the morning with my under eyes are hydrated. This product has a thick consistency but i does melt in the skin nicely. Doesn\\'t do well under makeup. I would reccomend this product.\\r\\nI recived a small sample of Belif moisturising eye bomb and I really needed a eye cream and its really nice it helps keep my eyes nice and soft and soft. Its really good stuff.\\r\\nI received this in my Ipsy bag and initially I was skeptical that it would provide the moisture that I needed. Upon application,  it didn\\'t feel as moisturizing as I would have liked, but once it fully absorbed,  I was amazed.  My eye area was smooth and extremely well moisturized. What a fantastic surprise!\\r\\nLove this product!!! A little goes along way and I swear it gets rid of under eye circles\\r\\nI Love this brand\\'s products so much!  This eye moisturizer is light weight, smells amazing, and instantly brightens and moisturizes!\\r\\nLove this ! Light weight and absorbs quickly without residue. No Oder and feels so nice on the skin. Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recommend for discoloration but great for hydration and reliable moisture for sure. Decent price and great amount\\r\\nLove this product for puffiness and darkness under my eyes! Brightened my eyes in a short time. Absolutely love the feel. Not sticky and glides right on. If u haven\\'t tried this product I suggest you do so!!\\r\\nOne of my holy grail eye creams before I switched to the current one I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on now. My eyes can tend to get very dried out especially being a makeup wearer. Every time I used this, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gone through 4 of these, my under eyes feel hydrated and good for makeup prep. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s light weight and very hydrating.\\r\\nMy under eyes are my worst feature ; its dark and puffy.Not cute!! I tried the aqua bomb and let me tell you ITS THE BOMB!!!  From one eye area to the other you can see a difference..First time user who is hooked.\\r\\nI received this in an Ipsy bag. A little goes a long ways. It is not heavy or greasy. I love it. I will be repurchasing this eye cream.\\r\\nNice lightweight daytime eye cream. This cream isn\\'t heavy and absorbs quickly into the eye area. This is very gentle for my sensitive eyes. I feel it is a great moisturizer but it did not work any miracles it just kept my under eyes hydrated. It would be nice if it did diminish wrinkles.\\r\\nI really love this eye cream. I have never been able to afford a full priced container (which is the biggest con in my opinion). However, everytime I have an option for the sample size, I go for it. (I think I\\'ve gone through 2-3 of the sample jars). It is soft, leaves skin feeling moisturized and dewy. Hydrates my eyes and helps me not get crazy under eye bags even when I don\\'t get a lot of sleep. Would definitely recommend.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a huge fan of this brand. The eye cream is gentle and hydrating for my (very) sensitive skin. It provides a great dose of moisture in a very dry climate.\\r\\nI wish this wasn\\'t so pricey, but it is so good that when I feel the need to splurge on an eye cream, this is my go to luxury-ish brand. It really makes my dry under eyes look hydrated and refreshed. It absorbs into the skin nicely. It also layers under concealer really well too.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nLove this product, I always use it in the morning and what I love the most about it is that is cruelty free!\\r\\nCreamy, but could be more rich. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easily absorbed and light, great every day eye cream.\\r\\nOk first I love all belief product! This eye balm was amazing! So hydrating and feels so nice going on. It leave you feeling hydrated and refreshed in the morning. I will definitely be buying this when I run out!\\r\\nI only have a sample size of this but it works wonders. I have bags under my eyes that are dry and this product has really helped with that!\\r\\nOnly eye cream that I use. I have extremely dry under eyes. This eye cream really moisturizes the under eye but is not heavy. This eye cream is also great under makeup as well.\\r\\nI was pleasantly surprised with this product. It was a small sample that I received as a free bonus from Sephora and I love it! This review is not sponsored.\\r\\nThis product has rave reviews but I\\'m not sure if I can get behind the hype. It certainly moisturizes the under eye area, but I don\\'t think it\\'s anything to write home about (especially for the price). It does a fine job, but I don\\'t really miss it when I swap it for something else.\\r\\nI decided to splurge on an eye cream a few months back and let me tell you this is one of the best purchases I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever made!!!!\\r\\nThis eye cream is great for sensitive skin. I used a lash serum that irritated the skin around my eyes. This was the only eye cream, out of several, that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate that skin and actually soothed it. I will definitely be repurchasing it!\\r\\nIn love with this product, my under eye are feels 100 times better than before. Super gentle and refreshing\\r\\nI originally got the sample size in an Ipsy bag two years ago, and I loved it so much I had to buy the full-size. This is all I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using ever since around my eyes. It leaves your skin hydrated for a whole day. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little pricey but in my opinion completely worth it. I suffer with dark circles under my eyes, and unfortunately it does not get rid of the dark circles. It just takes care of the skin around the eyes.\\r\\nI\\'ve been helping for a long time. An unusual product. love it very much\\xe2\\x9d\\xa3\\xe2\\x9d\\xa3\\xe2\\x9d\\xa3 It is a necessary product\\xf0\\x9f\\xa5\\xb0\\xf0\\x9f\\xa5\\xb0\\xf0\\x9f\\xa5\\xb0\\r\\nThe Greatest eye bomb ever! Texture nice and hydrating. Easily sinks in the skin. Great feeling on skin\\r\\nThis eye cream is so nice. A good layer of moisture for at night or during the day under makeup.\\r\\nOne of my top three under eye creams. The packaging is so cute with the blue and black. I love the way this cream feels. So smooth and luxurious under the eye. Really does hydrate and plump up any fine lines or wrinkles.\\r\\nI have few trial size if this eye bomb and been using it daily. It is light but hydrating enough to remove fine line underneath my eyes.\\r\\nMy favorite eye moisturizer! It really is extremely hydrating. If this was a product I could afford on the regular I would definitely buy it every time. Highly recommend this eye moisturizer! It glides so nicely and a little goes a long way!\\r\\nI only tried this product as a sample from Sephora when I first started experimenting with eye creams. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t speak much for the long term results, but if you are looking for an eye cream that provides a TON of moisture that actually lasts through the day, this is your eye cream. Probably the most moisturizing I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever tried and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried many. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m giving 5 stars based on the moisture, also that a little really does go a long way. My small sample lasted almost 2 weeks which was nice!\\r\\nI really enjoyed using this product. My under eyes felt more hydrated after the first use. After a couple months of use, my fine lines plumped up and are not as visible.\\r\\nI love how smooth and refreshing this feels! A tiny amount goes a really long way. Makes my makeup look very smooth.\\r\\nMy favorite eye cream! I\\'ve tried many eye creams and this one is the most hydrating. I have some find lines under my eyes and rather than treating it with a firming cream, I use this because it really hydrates and pumps my skin and in return, fine lines are less noticeable. The texture of my skin looks so much better. I\\'ll continue to repurchase.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nIts a good eye cream just not as thick as I would like mine to be. I prefer a thicker consistency and this one is very lightweight. It would be very good for people who wear eye cream under makeup however. It did a good job moisturizing my undereye though.\\r\\nReally good! I bought mine a few months ago in a trip to Boston and I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stopped using ever since. Light weight, my under eye skin feels smooth and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve started to notice that my eye bags are improving. Love it!\\r\\nI love this eye product. I notice a huge difference when I use it. My only complaint is that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work well as an under eye primer. But otherwise awesome!\\r\\nReduces fine lines and wrinkles under the eye, and is very moisturizing! It plumps up the skin, and the scent is light and fresh.\\r\\nA lightweight, refreshing eye cream that smooths fine lines with a 26-hour burst of moisture, boosts elasticity, and increases the resilience of the skin for flawless makeup application.\\r\\nI like how this product is so smooth and creamy, it makes your skin feel relief and fresh!\\r\\nThis was a good eye cream. It worked well and got the job done. Nothing special about It tho could be replaced with any other good eye creamn\\r\\nI can just drink this product up! After a night routine, the next morning my eyes feels like I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never worked or been stressed the week before!\\r\\none of the best eye contours that I have tried, I love it, it also moisturizes a lot and my eyelet is very dry, and it is not a heavy contour quickly absorbs yes gel type, it is my favorite\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so moisturizing and it feels like your getting a facial every time you use it. It does have a slight citrus scent so if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sensitive to scents, this may not be the eye cream for you. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thick so you barely have to use a lot, I recommend it.\\r\\nKeeps under eye area hydrated and healthy looking. Ive been using twice a day for over a year now. There\\'s a good amount in the container and you don\\'t need to use a lot. I usually try to buy when Sephora has a VIB sale.\\r\\nI am giving this 3 stars because I really didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any improvement. I will say it smells great and feels great. It really hydrated the skin but I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only just for the eyes, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just lotion to me I would say.\\r\\nAfter reading the rave reviews I decided to purchase this eye cream. Well, it was not the Holy Grail status cream for me. The skin around my eyes is sensitive and dry. While this cream is super lightweight with gel like consistency,\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0it irritated the skin around my eyes and I got small red bumps underneath my eyes.\\xc2\\xa0This cream also did not provide any moisture to my parched under eye area. This was just a miss for me.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very nourishing. I find it effective. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve even taken it on vacations since they have travel sizes that are very convenient. Packaging is really good.\\r\\nI love using this product. I have repurchased it a few times. I think it really makes a difference for my under eyes. It is luxurious and refreshing. So gentle! I recommend it for sure.\\r\\nThis is a really good eye cream. It\\'s so hydrating and lightweight. It sinks in easily and leaves my skin feeling plump and moisturized. I also feel like the more moisturized my skin is the less noticeable my dark circles are. Highly recommend\\r\\nAnother winner by belief. I don\\'t generally buy eye creams as I can\\'t really tell a difference after using them. However, this brand is amazing when it comes to hydration which is what my very dry skin needs. My under eye area both looked and felt more hydrated after using overnight. I definitely recommend!\\r\\nSo I loved the way this went on face. But my the morning I was broken out all over my face.  I was disappointing.  I wanted to love it so much.\\r\\nI love this eye cream for under makeup. Its works great under concealer. When I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using a formula that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drying I love to apply this eye cream so that It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look cakey.\\r\\nLove this product and how much is in it for the price! The packaging is sleek in shape and minimalist in design. I love that this isn\\'t a heavy cream! It also feels so refreshing, gentle, and cooling. Definitely one I will buy again as I\\'m pretty picky on eye creams.\\r\\nI LOVE this eye cream. It keeps my undereyes but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cause too much milia, which I can get if my eye cream is too heavy. I think that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little pricey and wish the packaging was a little bit smaller,but overall I do really like it.\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It leaves my under eye super hydrated and it absorbs quickly. I don\\'t mind that it comes in a tub, a little goes a long way. I wouldn\\'t change anything about this eye cream. Very good eye cream, just wish it was a little cheaper.\\r\\nI really love this stuff. It is really effective at hydrating your under eyes. I am a new user of this product and I have used a few by different companies. It definitely met my expectations in an under eye product. I definitely recommend this product.\\r\\nMy favorite eye moisturizer, it has the perfect consistency and makes me feel very hydrated. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect!\\r\\nThis eye cream is the bomb. My under eyes used to be dry but this was gentle yet hydrating enough.\\r\\nYASSS! Must buy. I use the aqua bomb facial moisturizer along with this eye cream and they are literally a dynamic duo. Must add to your daily regimen!! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI received a mini version of this as a sample or something, so I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it consistently. I did find it leaving my undereyes with a very cooling effect though. And not too heavy like a lot of eye creams I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve experienced\\r\\nI love how hydrating this belif moisturizing eye bomb is yet it doesnt feel heavy or tacky. It is not overly fragrant and i think it works very well.\\r\\nI bought a tiny size of this to try and i love it. It is light weight and absorbs quickly . My makeup lays very nice over it\\r\\nNot one to normally even use eye cream but I love this stuff! My eyes are super sensitive and this has been one of the few eye products that haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritated them! I love it!\\r\\nThis eye cream is perfect for day time wear but I feel like I need something more heavy duty for nighttime. It works well under makeup but I have not noticed a huge difference in the overall appearance or hydration of my skin\\r\\nThis is the most refreshing eye gel! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so cooling when you apply it & really moisturizes the under eye. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything for brightening but for just cooling and moisture this is perfect. I would really recommend this if you have dry under eyes. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tried it under makeup but this is awesome for night time.\\r\\nLove this eye cream. Very moisturizing and I love the texture. Definitely see a difference when I am using it to the lines around my eyes and my bags.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this for 2 years and I swear by it. It use it morning and night in alteration with other skincare as well. But this is one I always go back to. It moisturizes well and my eyes are very sensitive and this doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make my eyes water like crazy like slot of products do. It plumps and hydrates the eye area very well. Recommend this as a must have!\\r\\nBig fan!!!!!!!!!!! Worse it of trying !!!!!!!!!! Pretty simple and gentle  Easy to use Feel hydrated and fresh after couple used  Easy to travel with\\r\\nGreat eye cream! \\xc2\\xa0I only gave it three stars because it\\'s a bit pricey for the amount you get. This creme does leave your skin feeling more greasy and doesn\\'t blend easily into the skin.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI absolutely love this eye cream. It goes on well and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave my skin feeling sticky. \\xc2\\xa0My eyes look so refreshed in the morning!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nSuper light and hydrating - and you only need a tiny amount as a little goes a long way. It\\'s pricey, though. I got a mini version as part of a Belif set, so it was essentially free. I wouldn\\'t shell out $48 for 0.84 oz.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nAbsolutely LOVE this product. It is the one I use every night before going to bed. It helps with my puffy eyes. During the week I tend not to sleep as much, around 4 to 5 hrs, so I usually have a tired face the next day... until I used this product. Highly recommended! And the best part is that it gives you a refreshing sensation when you apply it.\\r\\nOverall good moisturizing eye cream but I have really bad dark circles and it didn\\'t much for that\\r\\nHighly moisturizing and non-irritating to my sensitive eye area. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very effective as an overnight eye mask as well. There isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t anything I would change. This was my first time using this product and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d definitely re-purchase!\\r\\nThis is the most refreshing eye gel! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so cooling when you apply it & really moisturizes the under eye. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything for brightening but for just cooling and moisture this is perfect. I would really recommend this if you have dry under eyes. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tried it under makeup but this is awesome for night time.\\r\\nLove this eye cream. Very moisturizing and I love the texture. Definitely see a difference when I am using it to the lines around my eyes and my bags.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this for 2 years and I swear by it. It use it morning and night in alteration with other skincare as well. But this is one I always go back to. It moisturizes well and my eyes are very sensitive and this doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make my eyes water like crazy like slot of products do. It plumps and hydrates the eye area very well. Recommend this as a must have!\\r\\nBig fan!!!!!!!!!!! Worse it of trying !!!!!!!!!!

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very effective as an overnight eye mask as well. There isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t anything I would change. This was my first time using this product and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d definitely re-purchase!\\r\\nLove this stuff! Super moisturizing and soothing! A lot of eye products make my eyes water but this doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nYour eyes are just as important as the rest of your skin. This was great for night time! Loved how my skin feels when using this.\\r\\nThis is amazing if you have fairly dry under eyes or even super dry. The scent is so good and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so light weight. It instantly hydrated and gives my under eyes a plump appearance and feel. Definitely recommend.\\r\\nIt does exactly what it says but my skin is very oily so sometimes I don\\'t need that moisturizing of an eye and it can still tend to be a little oily so I always recommend maybe padding off excess or using less than you normally would for an eye cream. But for dry skin I think this would be amazing\\r\\nIt was a little to thick for me because my eye bags prefer a gel or lighter cream.  It did feel moisturizing but also too heavy for me and wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t easy to spread.  I think it might be better for someone with slightly more mature skin as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in my mid 20s.\\r\\nThis is one of three eye creams that I use. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for moisturizing under the eye and it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sticky nor does the moisture disappear after 5 minutes of it being on my skin. It works great under makeup and helps reduce fine lines due to dryness.\\r\\nI received a deluxe size sample from Sephora. This is very moisturizing and feels really good in the under eye area. It felt like it was also depuffing, which means it\\'s great to use in the morning. I would never purchase it though since it\\'s not cruelty free.\\r\\nThis eye cream is pretty good. \\xc2\\xa0It is nice and light, which I like for under the eyes. \\xc2\\xa0It does not have an overwhelming scent and does not burn my eyes like some creams do. \\xc2\\xa0It works well both and night and in the morning under makeup.\\r\\nThis is a good normal Eye cream. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say I have really dark circles or creases or wrinkles or anything so I just use this as a normal eye cream to just help with moisture\\r\\nMoisturizing that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about it. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe in miracles when it comes to eye cream that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy that it only claims what it actually claims to do. Plus you get a enormous product in a giant tub.\\r\\nLove this a lot! I started having eczema around my eyes a few months ago. Wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure what to do about it and tried several eye creams. After  using this I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had eczema since! Makes my undereyes so hydrated!!!!\\r\\nLove this for when you need a little extra moisture and rejuvenation for your undereye\\r\\nI wanted to like this so badly. Unfortunately, belif eye creams make my eyes tear up for days. I think it has to do  with the fact that they are very highly scented. Most highly scented skincare isn\\'t for sensitive skin and even worse around the eye area...\\r\\nI\\'ve been using this product for months. It has helped with the puffiness and coloration. I think it has improved my eyes. It is pricey but a little product goes a long way.\\r\\nExcellent product. The areas around my eyes are dry and sometimes patchy. The belif eye bomb really helped moisturize and locked in moisture for the entire day. It is expensive for a small amount of product. But the small jar lasted me around 2 months.\\r\\nOne of my favorite products received, and it is now a staple in my skincare routine. Works really well, and provides a lot of moisture since my skin is normal/dry.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI typically apply this product under concealer if i know I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be wearing it so that it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t drying. This is a very good moisturizer and good for the eyes\\r\\nI received this from a box and I absolutely love it. It is extremely hydrating and has a silky texture. I have purchased a few times since. It is a must try.\\r\\nI got this product after seeing good reviews about it. I had hoped it make I dark eyes a little brighter but it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much. I might come back to this product when I get older as it might be more helpful then\\r\\nI\\'ve liked every product I\\'ve tried from belif so far. I really like the texture of the belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. It\\'s both rich and light at the same time, with a nice cooling sensation. I\\'m hoping to try the belif True Cream Moisturizing Bomb soon, and I think the two products together would feel very luxurious, at a reasonable price point.\\r\\nSuper moisturizing and isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t greasy. Goes on lightly and lasts all day. A little definitely goes a long way with this product.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI use this with the Aqua bomb moisturizer from Belif and I\\'m obsessed. This stuff is amazing and I can\\'t get enough. It\\'s so soft and feels silky I just want it to be all over my face which I\\'ve done a time or two. Anyone with dry under eyes I would 100% recommend.\\r\\n10 of 10 would recommend! I bought the eye bomb during holiday season to test out and immediately was hooked! it hydrates your under eyes like crazy and I totally recommend\\r\\nThis feels great and smells great but is very slow to sink in for me- I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put make up on over it. It also made me oily around my eyes. It may be good in dry climates or for dry skin but was just more moisture than I need.\\r\\nI just started using this eye cream. Put mine in my mini fridge for a super cooking effect. This really helps with my puffiness, I love how beautiful it absorbs, and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to see more from this product.\\r\\nMy favorite eye cream! A little definitely goes along way with this product and the consistency is more like a gel so it feels super lightweight and hydrating once applied! Almost instantly tightens under eye skin leaving no more bags, must try!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m now on my second jar and I am loving this. I have extremely sensitive skin and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to use any skin care line. But this stuff does the trick. I also use the moisturizer as well and together they are an amazing pair.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice eye cream but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice a difference from any of my fine lines.  It was hydrating enough, smooth enough, but I would not purchase this again.  Perhaps a more luxurious feeling would sell me.\\r\\nThis eye cream has helped my under eye bags completely!!! Also, it has helped my undereye concealer application tremendously! This is the best creek I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried in a while\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\r\\nGreat for my undereye area!! I out this on before bedtime and let it soak on in. It soaks in and moisturizes my undereye area so well. A little goes a long way and too much builds up and get greasy so just use a bit\\r\\nUn contorno de ojos de textura suave casi como un gel. Hidrata bien el contorno, no deja residuos y se absorve f\\xc3\\xa1cilmente. Dura bastante tiempo hidratado. Muy bueno para uso diurno o antes del maquillaje\\r\\nI love this brand.  It is not very affordable, but worth the price.  It has a nice smell, is not sticky or tacky, helps add moisture to a very dry area of your face.  I find it to be effective, and I will continue to use this line of products.\\r\\nNot hydrating enough. Still got some dehydration wrinkles even after apply this one. Little amount of product imo. Won\\'t buy again.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis is my ultimate favorite eye cream. It is super moisturizing and a little goes a long way. It does not have an over powering scent nor does it make my skin react in a bad way the way it has with other high quality moisturizers. All in all Belief products have been my favorite moisturizers that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used.\\r\\nI loved this product. However, It was on the more expensive side. I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to prevent signs of aging, or who has very dry skin. It is a little too thick for people with oily skin to use. I use this product every night before I go to bed and I love it!\\r\\nNever tried eye creams before and I\\'m in the process of building my skin care routine and decided to try this based on the reviews  it goes on light and did a bit of blurring.\\r\\nAnother eye cream with good reviews that I don\\'t get.I actually didn\\'t finish my sample size because this was doing nothing at all!If you don\\'t naturally have plump undereyes and really need a good moisturising cream don\\'t get this.From the texture I get it\\'s\\xc2\\xa0 probably for people with puffiness issues.\\r\\nAmazing texture! It\\'s not heavy like all the other creams, but it\\'s not too sheer that you think it\\'s not working. It\\'s like Spring, when the rains come and everywhere is dewy. You feel hydrated. Also, it can be used an eyeshadow primer. The price is high but it\\'s worth it. Scent: super light.\\r\\nI have a dry eye area and this eye cream was perfect, effective for my sensitive eye area, I was really impressed by this cream. It would be perfect if it came in a bigger size. The packaging not very practical I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like to put my fingers inside the cream because of my long nails but I would definitely recommend this product\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nVery moisturizing! Helped fill my under eye and helped with dry patches. The packaging was cute but simple.\\r\\nThe BEST eye cream I have ever used... too bad I have ran out of a sample I was using.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so good! But so expensive! If I had money I would definitely purchase the full size!\\r\\nMy favorite eye moisturizer ever! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moisturizing and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave any residue. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pricey but it lasts me a very long time! I have very sensitive skin and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not irritating.\\r\\nGreat eye cream if you are looking for hydration! Feels like you are splashing water under your eyes (in a good way!) or applying a cold spoon that is so relaxing. Also dries down almost like a balm.\\r\\nThis eye bomb is so moisturizing. It has a water-like consistency and applies smoothly. It leaves my under eye hydrated. However I didn\\'t see much difference in the lines or dark circles under my eye. And it\\'s pretty pricey for the amount of product.\\r\\nThis is a nice eye cream. It has a refreshing feeling and isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too thick or thin. My eye area feels much more moisturized after using this product. I would recommend!\\r\\nSuper hydrating and smoothing. Does NOT crease under makeup but definitely keeps the eye area from feeling too dry under products. It also doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sting if it gets in the eye which is a huge plus!\\r\\nThis container contains a good amount of product!   It feels great under the eye and wears well under makeup! It is hydrating...but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily fix my super dry undereye days that nothing else helps either. Overall recommend!!\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just way too good, and I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t found a good replacement for it. Of course there are other creams or serums that brighten or tighten or depuff for the day, but this feels like it long-term changes your face.\\r\\nI truly wish I could give this a 4.5/5 because it is so close to being perfect, but just not quite there. It is so incredibly moisturizing, which is my entire pursuit in an eye cream. Lovely texture, nice dry down, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stay tacky for too long. I do need to be careful with this before eye make up - if you use too much or don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait long enough, it will pill and crease with eye primer or eye shadow. The only things that would make this perfect for me are better packaging (some kind of squeeze, very annoying to constantly use a spatula), and if it was more gel and less cream (less thick).\\r\\nMy favorite eye cream - I keep getting samples of it and am about to bite the bullet and get the full size. Many eye creams are too thick and occlude the skin under my eyes, even causing milea, but NOT THIS ONE! It is light and has a cooling sensation and works year round. I even put it on my eyelids, which I\\'m usually careful about as they are sensitive. The scent is really nice too.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis product is very moisturizing, however I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure I see results better than layering my normal moisturizer under the eye. It has a tingling feeling and a pleasant scent upon application.\\r\\nI really like how thick this product feels, super moisturizing and a little goes a long way. I only used this before bed because the product is really thick and takes a while to dry. Feels lovely!\\r\\nThis cream is great uplift for your eyes! It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sticky and it helps with wrinkles and bags!\\r\\nThis eye cream is great for dry skin as it hydrates a lot and it\\'s gentle as well. A small amount goes a long way! I\\'ve had the sample size for awhile now and been using it almost every day.\\r\\nthey are NOT joking when they call it a BOMB!!! this product FLOODS my eyes with moisture, one dot goes a long way, and i can always always ALWAYS turn to this guy for a good pick me up in the eye area\\r\\nThis is a great moisturizing eye cream, I was very happy with this product! I also love that this brand is cruelty free!\\r\\nI love belif brand, this eye cream has truly helped improved the skin around my eyes, and it is really moisturizing, you really only need a little bit of product, I definitely recommend it!\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine - it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice eye cream with a gel-like consistency.  Absorbs fast and smells pretty good.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little expensive but a little goes a long way. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super soothing and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed a huge improvement in my under eyes\\r\\nGreat smell and very moisturizing! It\\'s not incredibly expensive compared to other stuff, so it\\'s good that this actually helps to reduce eye bag size, and is more affordable! I would buy again, I received mine as a present.\\r\\nI AM OBSESSED WITH THIS EYE CREAM! It is so light and hydrating. When you put it on, it doesn\\'t feel thick or creamy. The packaging is blue and black and very chic. I think this product is great morning and night. It helps tighten the undereyes and remove dark circles.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nOnce again, Belif knocked it out of the park with an awesome product! This eye cream is a dream for puffy, under eye circles and feels so nourishing to the eye area. I feel that it did noticeably help with dry areas around my eye the next morning after use. I prefer to use this at night. Love!!!\\r\\nI love this eye cream so much. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hydrating and the moisture lasts all day for youthful and rested eyes.\\r\\nThis actually ended up drying me out and causing a lot of flaking under my eyes. My skin is pretty oily, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like I lean towards dry skin. With moisturizing right in the name, I expected a lot more. Pretty disappointing.\\r\\nI use this eye cream religiously. It has a really nice, moisturizing feeling, like cold water on your face. I notice a huge difference every time I put it on.\\r\\nThis was a very hydrating eye cream but that is all it is. It didn\\'t depuff or brighten. I enjoyed using it but I probably won\\'t repurchase.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\ni always use this before applying my makeup and it really helps to prevent creasing. it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very light weight and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel heavy which i love! definitely would recommend if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re having trouble with creasing or have dry under eyes try this!\\r\\nI love it. I love how my skin feels supple under my eye. I wish it helped a little more with dark circles but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for dry skin. I have been repurchasing for years now.\\r\\nVery moisturizing and always helps perk my under eye area. I like how easy it is to blend in and you can put makeup on right after. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only ever had the small size but would definitely purchase the large.\\r\\nGreat smell and very moisturizing!

I got a sample size from ipsy subscription bag and loved it. After 5 days of use, I could see the difference, no other eye cream dared to show. A little goes a long way, so I think the price is good for not only quality but also quantity.\\r\\nI really enjoy this eye cream, it is lightweight and blends well.\\xc2\\xa0 A little bit goes a long way for sure. It is pricier than the drugstore brands but on the lower end of the high end brands so depending on your personal budget, this is a good product. I prefer something with some antiaging properties as well, but they have another product with firming so that can be an option for those that arent just looking to moisturize\\r\\nI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel like this was very hydrating under the eye but also didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cause any milia.\\r\\nThe best thing ever! If you want something that cooling and that makes your eyes feel super hydrated then this stuff you will love. It is on the more pricey side but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth it.\\r\\nThis stuff is literally the bomb. You can tell just from opening it that it will be a nice forming cream, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also moisturizing. I seriously LOVE this stuff and cannot recommend it enough.\\r\\nthis is so good, so hydrating, i bought two different sets from belif, each included eye bomb, loved using both 5ml, i would repurchase full size after i go through my current ones\\r\\nThis is my fav! I use it every night it just leaves your eye area feeling so moisturized and tight\\r\\nI have been using this eye cream for a while and a little goes a long way. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really hydrating and creamy and I really like the texture. The scent is subtle and really pleasant. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t my holy grail eye cream but I will gladly use it till my jar is gone.\\r\\nI bought this product about a month ago recommended by my dermatologist and I am so pleased with the results.\\xc2\\xa0 It feels more hydrated and nourished.\\r\\nThis product is amazing! I love the packaging the product everything. It smells amazing on top of being very moisturizing and cooling to the eye area which is important for the depuffing. I would recommend this for anyone looking for an eye cream\\r\\nI love this product! Anything to hydrate the area around my eyes is a must for me! I feel less wrinkles and very smooth when I use this product! The package is nice and sleek!\\r\\nIf you have dry patches around your eyes or you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re concealer doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try smoothly around your eyes. This product will definitely fix these problems. I had a dry patch on my eyelid and made eye shadows look no so cute. This product really hydrates the skin and actually made my dry patch disappear.\\r\\nThis is a really cool and refreshing eye cream. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found very few eye creams I actually like because my eye area is very sensitive, and most tend to be irritating. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had no issues with this one and it definitely does a good job of adding moisture to my eye area.\\r\\nI use this eye cream daily. I like that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel extra heavy and it is more of a gel-like consistency. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hydrating for the under eyes!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m obsessed with all things Belif! This eye cream feels so smooth and keeps the skin under my eyes feeling and looking hydrated.\\r\\nFave daytime eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deeply moisturising, creates a great base for makeup and I love how my under eye feels when I use it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s generously sized and worth the price. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d repurchase for my am routine.\\r\\nI trusted belief because I love their aqua bomb. And was in search of an eye cream. This product is the most affordable high end eye cream and it works Amazing.\\r\\nLove this product so much, it leaves my eyes very moisturised and is good value for money. The crepe was nice an lightweight-not to harsh on my skin- and it was nicely packaged. Really looking forward to trying more Belif products in future belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use a different eye cream ever again! This is AMAZING! It makes your skin feel so smooth and hydrated. When you put it on at night, you can see/feel the results the next morning!\\r\\nThis is very hydrating I use it day and night. I also use their face cream. My husband love the cream.\\r\\nVery thick and moisturizing! Have not seen a difference in undereye fine lines but definitely helped with puffiness and discoloration.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used this product a couple of times but I have not seen much improvement in the hydration or brightening for my under eyes. Might be good for those who are younger and are just starting to get into skincare.\\r\\nLasted a while. Seemed like it was gonna be a little too light but it goes on clear and feels very nourishing. Slowly made my dark circles look better.\\r\\nI really wanted to love this eye cream but sadly I was left wanting. It felt good going on. It was cooling to my eye area and seemed very gentle which is a very good thing since you putting it on your delicate eye area. Sadly, I did not see any results, my wrinkles laughed at the cream and the tears I cried as I saw no results just washed it away. I am sad but I have moved on to try other things. I am sure that others may see results it just wasnt the product for me.\\r\\nHydrating but dries down to a satin finish, perfect for under concealer! I have very dry under eyes and this works perfectly to prime for my makeup.\\r\\nGreat under-eye cream! Great consistency. Smells good. Gentle. Silky smooth and brings moisture to the under eyes. Use it every night.\\r\\nUsed a small container for at least a month and loved how hydrated it made the skin around my eyes! Two drawbacks are the fragrance which can cause irritation, and the $$ which isn\\'t justified by the ingredients.\\r\\nThis eye cream is my greatest love. I use every single morning under my eyes. It keeps my under eye hydrated and looks great under makeup.\\r\\nHands down my favorite eye cream for dry under eyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my daily go to during the winter and my nightly go to all year.\\r\\nI feel like my undereye was hydrated but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all, in an eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m personally looking for more than just hydration\\r\\nThis eye cream is a blessing for my sensitive eyes.

It is on the more pricey side but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth it.\\r\\nThis stuff is literally the bomb. You can tell just from opening it that it will be a nice forming cream, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also moisturizing. I seriously LOVE this stuff and cannot recommend it enough.\\r\\nthis is so good, so hydrating, i bought two different sets from belif, each included eye bomb, loved using both 5ml, i would repurchase full size after i go through my current ones\\r\\nThis is my fav! I use it every night it just leaves your eye area feeling so moisturized and tight\\r\\nI have been using this eye cream for a while and a little goes a long way. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really hydrating and creamy and I really like the texture. The scent is subtle and really pleasant. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t my holy grail eye cream but I will gladly use it till my jar is gone.\\r\\nI bought this product about a month ago recommended by my dermatologist and I am so pleased with the results.\\xc2\\xa0 It feels more hydrated and nourished.\\r\\nThis product is amazing! I love the packaging the product everything. It smells amazing on top of being very moisturizing and cooling to the eye area which is important for the depuffing. I would recommend this for anyone looking for an eye cream\\r\\nI love this product! Anything to hydrate the area around my eyes is a must for me! I feel less wrinkles and very smooth when I use this product! The package is nice and sleek!\\r\\nIf you have dry patches around your eyes or you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re concealer doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try smoothly around your eyes. This product will definitely fix these problems. I had a dry patch on my eyelid and made eye shadows look no so cute. This product really hydrates the skin and actually made my dry patch disappear.\\r\\nThis is a really cool and refreshing eye cream. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found very few eye creams I actually like because my eye area is very sensitive, and most tend to be irritating. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had no issues with this one and it definitely does a good job of adding moisture to my eye area.\\r\\nI use this eye cream daily. I like that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel extra heavy and it is more of a gel-like consistency. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hydrating for the under eyes!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m obsessed with all things Belif! This eye cream feels so smooth and keeps the skin under my eyes feeling and looking hydrated.\\r\\nFave daytime eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deeply moisturising, creates a great base for makeup and I love how my under eye feels when I use it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s generously sized and worth the price. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d repurchase for my am routine.\\r\\nI trusted belief because I love their aqua bomb. And was in search of an eye cream. This product is the most affordable high end eye cream and it works Amazing.\\r\\nLove this product so much, it leaves my eyes very moisturised and is good value for money. The crepe was nice an lightweight-not to harsh on my skin- and it was nicely packaged. Really looking forward to trying more Belif products in future belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use a different eye cream ever again! This is AMAZING! It makes your skin feel so smooth and hydrated. When you put it on at night, you can see/feel the results the next morning!\\r\\nI\\'ve been using it for four months and it hydrates the area around my eyes well. I find that eyeshadow glides on more smoothly since I started using it, but nothing too extraordinary. The price is kind of high for being a regular cream.\\r\\nLove this I have repurchased this product although it is a bit pricey completely worth it\\r\\nI love this moisturizer. It is amazing! The texture is water like and refreshing to the contact. I could wear it for night and day routine. It is super good on sensitive skin. I highly recommend. No scent at all. Just perfect.\\r\\nAbsolutely love this moisturizer. It keep under-eye hydrated and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel oily. I also the texture. I usually put it on before I go to bed. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice balance for your skin and leaves my eyes less puffy in the morning.\\r\\nThought I was going to love this product, but wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a must have for me. Formula felt nice and was a good consistency, and a little definitely went a long way, but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to make a difference on my eye area.\\r\\nI use this morning and night. This is a great product for sensitive skin. It is very gentle and has no real smell to it. I love the packaging and how long the product lasts! This is my go to eye bomb!\\r\\nLove, love, love this product! Very lightweight and not greasy at all! Has a cooling effect. It reduced some wrinkles and fine lines I had undereye. I got it for the first time and will get it again!\\r\\nExtremely moisturizing product! I love the texture and consistency of this eye cream. Its very light and it absorbs to the skin really quickly. This product is great even for oily/combination skin. Highly recommended. I would definitely buy it again.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nMy skin is dry and love the belif products. This eye cream definitely works and hydrates my skin.\\r\\nI got this in box of skin care items from Sephora. I wanted to start my anti-aging skin care early on in my life because it takes a while to see results. The thing I like about this is that it is really moisturizing. However, I feel like that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the only thing it is good for. I would not go out of my way to buy this again.    EDIT: after using this for several months, I DO NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT. Yes it is moisturizing BUT it caused little non-irritating tiny bumps under my eyes. ALSO, the veins near my eyes starting becoming more apparent. Has it reduced wrinkles? I see NO DIFFERENCE. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m more self conscious about my under eyes now more than ever. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m only keeping 2 stars because it is actually very moisturizing.\\r\\nGreat eye cream that hydrated and moisturizes the under eye! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very gentle and feels like water. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so thin and sits so beautifully under make up. I always have a jar and have repurchased several times!\\r\\nVery very very moisturizing, a great consistency, thats very easy to apply and use. Even a little dab of this gives off so much moisture, so it lasts a while, considering it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s size. I use it after I cleanse, tone, and put on my spot treatment. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d\\r\\nI love this eye cream it makes my under eye soft. Nice packaging the only thing is you need a small spatula.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis is my most favorite eye care product. The way it applies and dries onto your skin perfect. I absolutely love it\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nPretty good product. A little bit goes a long way, as the formula is very thick. I was expecting something lighter, as the aqua bomb is so airy. However, my eyes looked pretty good afterwards.\\r\\nI love how hydrating this eye cream is! A little goes a long way and it does a great job at making the eye area feel plump and moisturized.\\r\\nI have a fairly dry t-zone, so I use this under my eyes and on my nose at center of forehead. My skin was so much smoother and nourished when using in those areas. My under-eye concealer applies smoother with less creasing when using as well.\\r\\nIf you are willing to splurge on an eye cream this is the product you need to get. It absorbs super quickly, it\\'s not too thick and leaves your eyes feeling nice and cool. I like it especially for the hydration factor and how it helps with the puffiness. It is a great eye cream and I\\'m so glad I made the plunge on purchasing it.\\r\\nLove this eye cream it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so light and hydrating it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel sticky at all. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have wrinkles but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just using it for preventative care! I got a free sample so why not?!\\r\\nNice to have, but not really necessary unless you have an overly dry eye area. Feels nice and is definitely different from the face cream. It feels refreshing and cools off dry eyebrows especially. Worth a try!\\r\\nI always use this right before bed, it helps depuff my eyes and is great for the sensitive skin around my eyes. I will definitely repurchase and use again! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really great, I recommend it to all my friends\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gone through two of these and I just love them! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a thick, hydrating gel formula that works well for daytime under makeup or at night to hydrate your under eyes for the morning. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a reason this had such a cult following.\\r\\nAmazing eye cream that hydrates and smooths the texture under the eye with tons of hyaluronic acid. Absorbs quickly into skin so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect underneath makeup.\\r\\nLove this eye cream! Super hydrating but it is not heavy feeling at all. Can be used in the morning time and night! You also don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to use a crazy amount since it is thin and spreads pretty far.\\r\\nI bought a sample size of this and loved every use of it. It goes on so well and is extremely lightweight. It almost feels cooling under the eyes. You only need a little and it goes a long way. I will say the only thing this eye cream did for me was hydrate my under eyes. As far as it reducing dark spots or fine lines i didn\\'t see.\\xc2\\xa0 If you suffer from dry under eyes this is a must have for you. At least worth getting a sample!\\r\\nThis product is so nice and light, but really gets the job done without irritating my sensitive eyes. I use this every night before bed and have noticed that my under eyes seem so much more refreshed. I love this product and will definitely be repurchasing.\\r\\nReally nice product that definitely helps dry eyes. Very gentle and creamy. Also a really great price for the amount in the tub. This product would probably be best for people in their 20s that are just starting to use an eye cream. Beautiful packaging.\\r\\nSuper easy to use and work into your skin. I have oily skin and this product definitely works wonders for me. Leaves my skin moisturized without looking greasy.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis has been my favorite eye cream. I had dry flaky skin on my lids and used this eye cream in my morning and nightly routine. After 2 days my dry patches were gone and under eye fine lines less noticeable!\\r\\nI love this eye cream so much. I have really dry, sensitive under eyes so this is a night time must for me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it for over a year and would highly recommend.\\r\\nI received a sample size of this eye cream in an ipsy bag a few months ago and I LOVE it. My under eye area gets dry very easily, especially when I wear concealer more than 3x a week. I put this on at night after I wash my face and it\\'s lightweight enough to not feel greasy but delivers so much hydration that I have been able to see a visible difference in the skin in as little as a couple of weeks\\r\\nOMG! This cream is amazing! I ultra moisturizer, light and smell super good!! I bought the travel size and I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to buy the full size!! I loved it!!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this for months and months. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really is moisturizing and nice. I have haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had dry skin under my eyes or around my eyes in ages. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really feel like it does anything for fine lines or wrinkles, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good moisturizing eye cream.\\r\\nLove love love this product I got it to pair with their moisturized and I now I cant live without it , it is a little on the pricey side but I always reccomend paying more for your skincare ! It\\'s very effective and has made my under eyes more hydrated and brightened !\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is my absolute favorite! Since I started using it it has lightened my dark circles and has improved the overall look of my under eyes. I love it!\\r\\nIts the in name! It truly serves its purpose and does a great job in ensuring my eyes stay moisturized through all seasons. I find myself using this porduct over and over again! It makes me feel light and more bright when its needed :) its a must try!\\r\\nReally hydrating and moisturizing eye cream - I use it in my AM and PM routines and noticed a difference in how \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfresh\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cawake\\xe2\\x80\\x9d my eyes look.\\r\\nI just started using this one. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really moisturizing and my wrinkles and dark circles do look better. I would highly recommend.\\r\\nIt definitely does its job at moisturizing your eyes, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure you could find eye creams that do more for less. It does come with a lot of product compared to most other brands so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a pretty good value.\\r\\nI am obsessed with this belief moisturizing eye bomb! It is so hydrating and smooth on the skin. I suffer from dry under eyes and I apply this twice a day in the morning and night, I have noticed a huge change in my under eye, less dry and no puffiness. This is a must have for all skin types!\\r\\nThe feel of this product is positively delightful; lightweight, slightly cool-feeling, spreads very easily. As someone in their mid-30s, I am looking for something with some wrinkle-fighting power and sadly, this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it. It does a dynamite job hydrating, but did not notice wrinkle fighting or lifting power.\\r\\nLove this to death!! Gonna need more soon, you can tell the second you put it on that\\'s it\\'s good! I love it so much, I bought the face moisturizing bomb, which was pretty pricey, but that\\'s how much faith I have in this brand.\\r\\nThis is a really great eye cream for hydration, but I suggest only wearing it at night because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very thick and takes a long time to soak in. I live in a very cold dry climate in the winter time and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re saved my eye area. I will definitely be re-purchasing this every winter and I highly recommend it for people who live in really cold places.\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It really smooth the under eyes. Very moisturized. A little bit goes along way.\\r\\nI wanted this product to be my solution for dark circles, but after finishing the sample size, I can honestly say that I do not see a difference in the appearance of my dark circles. It\\'s moisturizing and refreshing, but that\\'s about it. I will not be buying the full size.\\r\\nOhhhh... I love Aqua Bomb and wanted to like this so much! \\xc2\\xa0I ordered it as soon as it came out, and after using it for awhile, I can only work up an unenthusiastic \"meh\" when reviewing it. \\xc2\\xa0Let me start by saying my under -eye area is dry and I use Retin-A. \\xc2\\xa0So....I need a really rich moisturizer. \\xc2\\xa0This feels good when applied, but quickly dries up on me after just a few minutes. \\xc2\\xa0Then my under -eye area feels like I have applied nothing. \\xc2\\xa0And, when using under concealer.... forget it. \\xc2\\xa0My concealer creases pretty badly. \\xc2\\xa0That being said, if you don\\'t require alot of lasting moisture, this may work great for you. \\xc2\\xa0I am going back to my Sheseido Benefiance. \\xc2\\xa0Ugh! \\xc2\\xa0SO EXPENSIVE!\\r\\nAH-MA-ZING. I had really liney under eyes. I\\'m young and smile a lot, I don\\'t know how many I had for sure but dang. I\\'ve been using a sample of this for about a month or two, and I pretty much have no fine lines under either eye now. It\\'s so moisturizing and plumps them up too!\\r\\nI bought this eye cream about a week ago. I was excited to use it based on all the good reviews. And best believe this product is worth the hype! I have a few fine lines under my eye and VERY sensitive skin so I was slightly concerned that I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to use this product because I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use most products because they break me out. But this didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t! Also, my fine lines are fading and my skin is very hydrated. Definitely a must buy.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve actually haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t used eye creams much before so I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what to expect but WOW. This product is so hydrating and I actually noticed a difference within just a few days. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightweight too so it feels amazing on the skin and you just need a tiny amount.\\r\\nThis is the best eye cream I have ever tried. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so moisturizing and light. I use it twice a day as my skin area around eyes gets dry a lot and looks excessively wrinkly. It does a great job moisturizing the area and therefore minimizing the wrinkles.\\r\\nOne of the best eye creams I have ever used! I use this nightly because it is kind of thick, but that is why it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing to use overnight for me. I wake up with the most refreshed eyes and they are so hydrated, I sometimes struggle with dry under eyes and this has changed the game for me. Holy grail product!!!\\r\\nI always use this one my eyes after Botox injections. It is soothing and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get sticky. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good, basic eye cream. It hydrates even the most sensitive of eyes without irritation or residue. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a staple for creaseless concealer application.\\r\\nRecently I purchased the a Belif skincare set at Sephora one of the items in the set was theBelif Moisturizing Eye Balm. I LOVE this product I can\\'t emphasize it enough. This cream is not too heavy or light it has the perfect consistency. I have normal / slightly dry skin this absorbs quickly into the skin. Be careful not to get it in your eyes it will BURN!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nMy holy grail eye cream! I use it every morning and it really hydrates my under eyes and helps with any puffiness I may have.\\r\\nA good product for the eye care. Since im using it I feel my eyes less dry and with less rides. The packaging its nice, but it\\'s really big, there is not full of cream. I also love the smell and sensation it gives to my eye skin. I really recommend this product.\\r\\nBeen looking for an eye cream forever that won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be too greasy or heavy, but will also actually do something. This one is it! I know it is impossible for a cream to really help undereye circles but for keeping that area moisturized this is fab.\\r\\nDidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything for my dark circles, hydrating but that was all. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great product for anyone looking for hydration!\\r\\nI really wanted to love this product I felt like it made my under eyes hydrated however it gave me tiny white dots under my eyes so I had to stop using it which was super disappointing I wish it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t clog my poors\\r\\nI use the Moisturizing Eye Bomb in my nightly routine and love it. I apply a layer under each eye after the AHA/serum portion of my nightly routine to help prevent irritation or dryness in my under eye area. The extra moisture really helps minimize my fine lines and textural issues.\\r\\nSo moisturizing under the eye! It sets quickly too so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great to wear under makeup to help your concealer go on and stay on even and smooth\\r\\nI must say that this eye bomb is definitely hydrating, i only got the mini sample one and i cant stop using it, i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll definitely for sure buy the big one once im done with my mini sample. Definitely 100% recommend it.\\r\\nNice moisturizing product.\\xc2\\xa0 I received a deluxe sample in a subscription box.\\xc2\\xa0 Didn\\'t provide any other benefits that I noticed.\\r\\nI have never been an eye cream lover as the ones I\\'ve tried have felt heavy and oily. But THIS ONE. This is the one. The holy grail. I use it with my\\xc2\\xa0 belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb and it is a match made in heaven. Extremely cooling and light, and instantly de-puffs. 100% worth the money!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nYes! This eye cream goes on light but keeps your eyes hydrated. I have very puffy and dry undereye and this performs very well. This is a staple item for me.\\r\\nThis eye cream is amazing. SO moisturizing and it lasts forever! 10/10 would buy again.\\r\\nReceived it in my shepora monthly subscription sample. Very cooling feeling! Loved how smoothly it glides on. Not a thick consistency very light.\\r\\nYou guys really need to try this BOMB! I use this to moisturize my eye area before my makeup and it works amazing. Love the packaging, good price, it works very good! My concealer is always in place it gives a natural look an long lasting  \\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\r\\nI absolutely love this stuff! I started using this while on accutane because my skin and eye area got so dry. This helped a lot. I usually get milia from eye creams but not from this. I think the price is good because it lasts a very long time. I had a sample size which is the size of a penny, and an inch tall and it lasted me for months and months.\\r\\nWhenever I used this eye cream at night I would wake up and feel very refreshed under my eyes but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much for discoloration under the eyes. I think it would be best used as a preventative treatment against wrinkles and to refresh your eyes but if you have any kind of more severe issues this wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be for you\\r\\nThis stuff is really bomb! I have extremely dry skin and even dryer under eyes which is why I almost never wear concealer but this stuff has really helped with that. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so juicy feeling haha I love this stuff\\r\\nI seem to always come back to this eye cream. It feels really good on the skin and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never had any problems with it.\\r\\nThis is probably the best eye cream I\\'ve tried.\\xc2\\xa0 I still have lines and dark circles, but it goes on smoothly and doesnt irritate my skin.\\xc2\\xa0 It\\'s very moisturizing .\\r\\nI love this eye cream. Its super moisturizing and it absorbs so quickly! It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave any residue behind. I bought this product in last april and I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had to repurchase yet. One little tub has lasted me an entire year.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nIt was moisturizing and had a nice feel, but it gave me some bumps on my eyes. It was disappointing because my under eye area felt sensitive after using it a few times.\\r\\nI love how this soaks into my skin. I get very dry right under my eyes, so I apply this 20 minutes before my makeup and it helps my concealer from creasing/looking dry. I would recommend this!\\r\\nI really like how lightweight and moisturizing it is, especially under my eyes. It absorbed quickly and play very well with my make up. A favorite of mine last summer. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is just looking for an eye moisturizer that is lightweight and works under make up. Since I need more than just a moisturizer I have moved on from this product.\\r\\nReally great product for simple hydration. It comes in a gel/water-like texture and a little bit of product goes a long way!\\r\\nI have always been very dry underneath my eyes and my concealer would crease no matter what i did. This product has been a game changer. My concealer and skin has never looked better. I will definitely be re-purchasing.\\r\\nSuper moisturizing. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need much product so it lasts a really long time. It did a good job in moisturizing\\r\\nThis product is definitely water based and you can tell when you apply it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very light on the skin and absorbs quickly. I like using it at night before I go to bed. Be careful to not put it too close to the actual eye because it can irritate your eyeball if it gets in it.\\r\\nThis is a great product for its price. It\\'s definitely hydrating because my eye area feels so happy after using. With some eye creams, it still feels tight and dry or the cream is sticky, but this applies smoothly, absorbs quickly, and is definitely hydrating for this desert girl!\\r\\nThis is the bomb of eye creams. Just saying. Its so hyrdrating and awakes my eyes and senses. I will definitely repurchase this again.\\r\\nI like this eye cream. Love thr smell and texture. It provides a decent amount of hydration but i am getting to the age where i need a bit more than just hydration in my under eye area. I did not feel like it provided any benefit to deep under eye wrinkles. Would recommend this product for someone really only wanting to target hydration of the under eye area.\\r\\nAfter trying many eye creams for years I\\'ve finally found the one that works for me. This really gets the job done. It hydrates, primes, depuffs, and lessen fine lines. My concealer goes on much smoother when I have this on my eyes. This is the only eye cream that really absorbs into my skin when applied, not like other creams that would just sit on the skin. It\\'s very light formula and only need tiny bit. Use it for Am and PM. It\\'s a #musthave in my #skincareroutine\\r\\nFeels hydrating, but I haven\\'t noticed any big change. I have sensitive skin, so it\\'s gentle and doesn\\'t sting. I\\'d buy again!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis product is amazing I have the worst under eye circles and this cream has helped moisturize my eye continuously. I love the belief products and I highly recommend using them!\\r\\nI refrigerate this. I like this product a lot, it feels moisturizing and goes on nicely. A little pricey in my opinion but is a good product. I use it morning and night, it helps wake you up in the morning if you refrigerate.\\r\\nI really loved this when I first used it because it is really moisturizing, but over time it didn\\'t diminish signs of aging and that is what I\\'m looking for in an eye cream now that I\\'m in my 30\\'s. If you are looking for something just super moisturizing, this is it. If you want anti-aging I would choose another product.\\r\\nI absolutely love this eye moisturizer. It is moisturizing without being greasy. It has a very light velvety feel.\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb I received this in a beauty box and have to say like all the other belif products I have tried I am really enjoying the quality of this product. It goes on so smoothly and feels deeply hydrating and silky in texture without being too heavy or oily feeling.  Quite unique.. Never tried another eye product like this... Would defo consider repurchasing.\\r\\nDefinitely moisturizing. I little goes a very long way with this eye cream. Keeps my under eyes nice and moisturized all night long. I do feel like it helps with the fine lines I have but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure about my dark circles.\\r\\nAmazing product. Works really well to hydrate your under eye area. I don\\'t think it lasts the whole timeframe that they state because I do end up putting some more on later in the day. However, I\\'m in Wisconsin and the cold weather does dry my skin out pretty badly.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s My favorite running eye cream. It goes very smooth with concealer. no under eye milia problem with this product, otherwise I faced this problem with other products.\\r\\nI love this product it keeps your eye super moisturized and helps with puffiness. I recommend this to my best friend as well\\r\\nWorks amazing! My eyes immediately felt so hydrated. I not only looked awake, I felt awake. A little goes a long way so the price tag is not an issue. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a worthy investment.\\r\\nThis is a nice moisturizing eye cream. O have not noticed any other benefits, but it has a nice weight and wears well under makeup.\\r\\nI love this line of products! This one in particular gives a good amount of hydration under the eyes. I like to use it before I apply makeup to avoid dryness throughout the day. For an extra bonus, pop it in the fridge so it remains cool and refreshing!\\r\\nEye cream is super lightweight, hydrates the under eye but it does not leave an oily feeling. Formula absorbs fast into the skin wich makes it perfect before makeup and helps the concealer to look amazing.\\r\\nI received this as a sample from Sephora. I have been using this every night before my moisterizer and it really hydrates my undereye area. It has no fragrance and a light formula. I think it would play well under makeup. I use something different in the am. I will purchase the full sized version when my sample is gone. Highly recommend.\\r\\nThis eye cream is wonderful. It\\'s not too heavy and is not heavily fragranced. Soaks right in and leaves the skin around your eye so soft.\\r\\nI received a sample for this and loved it so much, I have it to my mother and bought the full size for myself. It\\'s wonderful! So creamy, moisturizing and soothing. But it\\'s not heavy at all--just like the rest of the line. Great stuff that I definitely recommend\\r\\nIt doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t NOT work but I expected better hydration from the product. My eyes got really dry this winter and this was not a good solution for that.\\r\\nI love this bomb. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating and makes a great base for under eye concealer once it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fully absorbed.\\r\\nAlways \"believed\" in my belif products! Got a sample of this from Sephora and brought it with me on my travel to Japan. Since then, I\\'ve been using this and I bring it with me on my trips. Extremely moisturizing and love the scent. I combine using it with my belif face moisturizer. Overall, a great product!\\r\\nThis eye cream is so cooling and great for early mornings when you feel a lot of puffiness. It\\'s a gel-cream formula so it\\'s a bit lighter but my undereyes always feel moisturized. You do need a little extra during wintertime though, I find.\\r\\nThe formula is very refreshing and keeps the under eyes quenched and hydrated. It is a water based formula so it is not too heavy on the eyes and gives a smooth finish. The jar goes a very long way and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth the money. I have not noticed the product reduce discoloration however it does keep the area refreshed and bright. I would definitely recommend!\\r\\nThis saved my eye skin, which was getting so dry it was painful. I use it under my eye and also on the lids and it keeps my delicate eye skin soft and supple and looking younger. So worth the price, which is reasonable to begin with.\\r\\nI really like this product! Definitely hydrates and extremely gentle on my sensitive skin! A product that does what it says it will, absolute plus!\\r\\nThis product smells light and pleasant, it isn\\'t too heavy or greasy and helps to minimize fine lines and wrinkles. I haven\\'t been using this cream for very long so I am eager to see the results from regular use.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nIt does a good job moisturizing, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see much improvement in any other way. It has a more watery consistency than most eye creams. I think this eye cream is best suited for younger skin and not those in need of wrinkle reducing or dark circles.\\r\\nI got this as sample in my Sephora Playbox then bought a full size after I finished it. This cream is most effective when it is put in the fridge! IT WORKS SO MUCH BETTER!!! It is definitely good for puffiness but not much effectiveness for dark circles, which is why I\\'m giving 3 stars.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nReceived a sample of this recently and will probably be purchasing the full size! Worked well,  just was slightly slick under my concealer!\\r\\nI was pleasantly surprised by the belif Eye Bomb. I got a sample of it from Sephora not thinking I was going to feel any particular way about it. I\\'ve used a few other belif products and enjoyed them a lot, so I shouldn\\'t have been surprised by how creamy and moisturizing the Eye Bomb was. Normally my \\'low-end\\' eye cream is Fresh Black Tea and my absolute favorite eye cream is by Cle de Peau which is uber-pricey, so I was pleasantly surprised to find an eye cream I liked that was even more reasonably priced!\\r\\nI love most every Belif product I\\'ve tried, and this is one of my favorite eye creams. It\\'s lightweight and not greasy, but it provides and impressive amount of moisture. I smooth it on both under my eyes and on my eyelids, but I never have problems with it creasing in conjunction with concealer or eye shadows. I don\\'t have issues with puffiness, but I do find that it helps soften my skin and seems to help keep the appearance of fine lines at bay. I really adore the light herbal scent that Belif uses in their products, including this one. A solid eye cream within it\\'s category.\\r\\nLove this belif moisturizing eye bomb. Feels really rich and smooth going on and it\\'s so moisturizing - it feels like a tall drink of water for my eyes. Definitely on the creamy/heavy side but that works well for me. Pairs well with the moisturizer.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI have extremely sensitive skin, especially on my face and even more so around my eyes which makes me tend to be nervous whenever trying a new eye cream, I had zero issues with this one though! I really like the gel texture and would repurchase.\\r\\nI had a small sample from Sephora and I\\'m still currently using it. It\\'s effective, but still not what I\\'m looking for. It burns my under eye area when I apply it, but I also have very sensitive skin. Moisturizes the area well, though. I won\\'t purchase this for myself.\\r\\nOne of the better eye creams I have tried. I do have to say though it is not for dark circles but otherwise it is amazing for the texture under the eye, smoothing and plumping.\\r\\nGot this in a travel pack! A little bit goes a very long way. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really gentle on the under eyes but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed any difference.\\xc2\\xa0Good old value for the price since the product can last you long\\r\\nI freaking love this eye cream. I\\'ve been having a really bad come with my under eye skin being super dry lately, and this stuff turned that right around. The texture is great, it feels soothing on the skin, and I definitely noticed a huge change in the hydration in that area. Love it.\\r\\nI love this product! I got it as a sample size  from Sephora (for 100 points). I ended up getting 2. I was worried because the Sephora skincare consultant told me that she had a bad reaction to it because she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s allergic to an ingredient in it but I decided to give it a try any way because I want something hydrating. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely hydrating and goes on smoothly. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave an oily residue or film on the skin. It also works well under concealer. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t claim to address any other skin concern but dryness and for the price point I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather buy a product that addresses multiple concerns.\\r\\nI am addicted to their face moisturizer and was delighted to try the eye cream. Gentle, calming, smoothing.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not quite sure it does enough to merit the price, but more active ingredients usually make my eyes water.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this product for a couple of months now and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen a difference. My under eyes no longer feel so dry very hydrating. I sometimes even put this around my nose because I can get very dry in that area\\r\\nThis is one of the best eye creams I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found. I have dry, sensitive under eyes and this is perfect. My other two favorites are from amorepacific and La Mer, but this is comparable and is the most affordable of the three.\\r\\nAbsolutely love this!  One of my favorite eye creams!  I will be repurchasing!  This was my first time using it & I found the formula to be light, cool & gentle.  It is comparable in price to other prestige brands.\\r\\nBelieve the hype! This products works wonders. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed the puffiness I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had has been improved. Helps keep my under eye area well moisturized.\\r\\nI LOVE this, I love how moisturizing it is on my under eyes. It really prevents crepiness, especially with makeup. I find that it really helps my concealer look smooth and even under my eyes. Would recommend to a friend!\\r\\nOMG, I love this stuff! It is like a tall drink of water for my under eyes. It feels so good, and seems to smooth out my fine lines a bit.\\r\\nI love the Aqua Bomb, I love the Hungarian water, and the gel oil and this is no different. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever disliked a Belief product so far.\\r\\nWhen it comes to the skin around my eyes, I have to be super careful about sensitivity. The belief eye bomb is literally my saving grace. My under eyes are ALWAYS dry, and this cream helps with that tremendously. A little goes a LONG way, so the price point is worth it for the benefits.\\r\\nLove love love love this stuff! It is so hydrating under the eye and a little goes a long way. I got the small sample size from Sephora points and it lasted me almost a month! So spending your money On the big size is totally worth it! It has helped my fine lines under my eyes when I apply twice a day.\\r\\nHaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t used this for that long but I do like the texture and moisture it brings. I do feel it plumps my skin but I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using too much because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been noticing it has been pilling on my skin. It could be a mixture of serums as well so I have to play around and maybe use it and night . Anyone else having this issue? I do like it so far. Just wanna play with it more.\\r\\nI love this! It didn\\'t burn my eyes which is a miracle because half the eye surums and moisturizers out there do! I used the whole little jar that I got because it hydrated my eyes really well and helped with some eylid flaking that I\\'m prone too. I haven\\'t bought a full size because of the price yet but I probably would some day . I didn\\'t see any results as far as helping with fine lines or puffiness or any of that but it is very thick and hydrating and not irratating at all .\\r\\nLove this product! It delicately moisturizes my under eyes and makes them feel and look very hydrated in the morning.\\r\\nVery hydrating for the under eye area!! Nice packing and easy to travel with. I have very dry under eye areas and it helps keep my concealer looking nice and fresh not cakey! Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do too much for brightening but excellent for hydration\\r\\nThe best eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried so far. Application is nice and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my sensitive skin. A little goes a long way so the jar will last a while.\\r\\nOne of the best eye cream/moisturizers I have ever tried. I have very dry under eyes and this stuff was amazing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a thick clear gel like consistency but it definitely moisturizes. It was also great under my makeup and make my concealer slide right on. I highly recommend and will be repurchasing when I can.\\r\\nOnly eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll ever use now ! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so moisturizing and gentle on my skin which is super sensitive. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too expensive and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lasts so long , worth the price.\\r\\nI love how soft my skin is after this product! It doesn\\'t make me more oily, and gives a great base under my makeup. I am a frequent user of these products and I really enjoy the smell and packaging. I have not been disappointed by any Belif product\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nExtremely hydrating on the eyes. It layers well under my make up which I was happy about. because many eye creams I have previously used do not layer well with my make up. I like how it is a gel formula because it feels very refreshing on the skin to really plump it up.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI just recently bought this product and I already love it so much. The formula is so moisturizing. I love it so much\\r\\nGot it as a sample size once, so not a repeat user. Liked the formula but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t last super long. Kind of a waxy texture\\xe2\\x80\\x94 nice that it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too creamy or watery but might not be for everyone! Got the job done but not convinced it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life-changing!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis is a great eye cream. It has diminished my under eye wrinkles decently. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmagic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d product by any means. However it makes the under eye feel moisturized over all looks/feels better. I recommend to only use this at night. It does take a long time to soak in, so I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recommend using before makeup. Overall, I like it!\\r\\nI love this! It helps keep my undereye looking bright and takes away dullness. Provides adequate moisture without being greasy.\\r\\nI love the way this eye cream feels when applying and the way it soaks into my skin. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be 33 in a couple of months so I have some creases under and around my eye. This cream plumps my skin so well and leaves it so moist that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m able to bake under my eyes without worrying about the creases being accentuated when makeup cakes in them.\\r\\nI have been using this eye cream for over a year and absolutely love it. I use it at night and find that my eyes look more awake as opposed to when I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it. I do find that I still have dark circles, however this cream is extremely moisturizing!\\r\\nLove this eye cream so far. Very moisturizing and thick without irritating my eyes. I really like to put this moisturizer on before bed, and then when I wake up and put makeup on my under-eyes look and feel very hydrated and plump instead of dry and settling into fine lines.\\r\\nI love this eye cream!!! I have a sample that has lasted for weeks because you only need a little product to obtain the necessary hydration. It\\'s super moisturizing, absorbs quickly, leaves skin soft, does not irritate, feels good under makeup and the moisturizing effect has lasted all day even if I washed my face. I feel comfortable with this moisturizer, plus it brings a lot of product for the price. Honestly, I intend to buy this great product!!\\r\\nThis is a really great eye cream! I received a small sample size which lasted two weeks. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I would be able to see results from such a small tub but I was shocked to see results! I have genetic deep eye bags that are purplish blue. After ten days I saw a huge difference in my under eyes. They were bright and not as puffy. While you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change genetics, this product certainly helps the under eye look great. Definitely worth the price !!!!!\\r\\nBEST EYE CREAM! I fell in love with this eye bomb when I noticed how smooth my makeup went on above it. You need to try this product because you will not be disappointed.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s creamy but gel like at the same time. It really moisturizes my under eye. It gets the job done. And my makeup sits perfectly over it\\r\\nI love this product it makes my under eyes less dry and look awake and decrease the fine lines\\r\\nLoved the consistency! So creamy and felt like it would be super moisturizing but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see a huge difference around my eyes. I get very dry around my eyes and this did not do the trick. Great smell too but not for extra dry eyes.!\\r\\nObsessed with this product! I have trouble with insomnia and get eye bags easily but this product does wonders. It is a bit pricey but a staple piece in my skincare routine.\\r\\nBest eye cream for dry eyes. After continuous, my eyelids no longer flake because of this product. The formula is lightweight and q little goes a long way. This is pricey for an eye cream, but it\\'s worth every penny. I just wish the container was in a pump with an applicator, so that it would be easy to apply.\\r\\nOh my gosh!! This was recommended to me at Sephora and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in love! I picked up a sample and saw results after the first couple days. I used to get the worst dry patches under and around my eyes that my foundation and concealer would cling too and look cakey no matter what I did. When I started using this it reduced the appearance of dryness a LOT. I want to go pick up the full size but the only downside is the price tag or I would have been on it immediately! But a little goes a long way so I would say this is worth the investment. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so soft too and makes my skin feel So good! I have to be careful what I put on my face considering I have combination Acne prone skin but this worked for me!!\\r\\nI can\\'t say if using this eye cream has made much of a difference because my eyes are not my trouble area, but I will say that this is a very soothing cream that seems to absorb well into my skin\\r\\nLifesaver. Game changer. Bag-breaker! Literally fixes under eye bags instantly and plumps up tired hangover eyes! On par with La Mer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the eye concentrate/creme.\\r\\nThis product is lightweight and doesn\\'t have any smells that would be unpleasant. It does have one of those fool packages though - a small container disguised as a larger one. It definitely hydrates, but I can\\'t tell if it\\'s a historically different change than when I began using it.\\r\\nPurchased early December it does what it promises, very moisturizing. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give a full opinion on it since I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been using it regularly.\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is instantly hydrating and soothing. After trying many other brands, I\\'ve settled on this product because it is quickly absorbed and restored my dry skin during the cold winter. Ive even noticed a reduction in lines around my eyes.\\r\\nThis is a very moisturizing eye cream that keeps my undereye moisturized all day and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t crepe under concealer at all. Great value for the price. I look forward to trying other products from this brand. So far everything I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried has been top notch.\\r\\nI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t honestly tell if this works because it burns my eyes. I feel like it never penetrates my eye area and moves around. I do like the packaging it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attractive, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m disappointed & wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy again.\\r\\nThis is the most hydrating under eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used. I use this day and night and I can always tell when I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it religiously. It is a bit pricey but I think it is totally worth every penny.\\r\\nThis stuff is the most moisturizing product I\\'ve found in a LONG time. It works so well. I use it on my eyes everyday twice a day and even on dry patches on other places on my face when needed. My eyes are significantly more moisturized when I keep up with this routine and I can definitely tell how much dryer they are when I forget to use this. I will be buying this over and over again for a while.\\r\\nThis eye cream is amazing.  It immediately adds intense hydration to my eye area.  It truly moisturizes my skin and makes it feel plump and bouncy.  It is gentle and the formula is not sticky.  The product absorbs quickly and it comes in an adorable blue jar.  I am already in the process of repurchasing it.\\r\\nI have tried this in the past a few times when it came in a kit with my belief true cream for my day time eye cream. This eye cream seems to really moisturize the under eye area and I would recommend it.\\r\\nIt was not as good as I hoped. I liked the texture but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to absorb well so I didnt see it making much of a difference.\\r\\nThis is my daily eye moisturizer. I love it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great price and works great. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried so many, but this is definitely one of my favorites. It always makes my concealer look amazing!\\r\\nLoving this eye product since using it my under eye bags have faded I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very happy with the results I literally recommende this eye cream product\\r\\nI feel like this really helps because at the end of the day my eyelids can get oily and it has stopped since I started to use this!belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nSinks into the skin and gives intense hydration to my dry and dehydrated skin. A great all purpose eye cream that  deserves a try. I think it\\'s ideal for winter!\\r\\nSuper moisturizing, and a great base for concealer. Keeps my undereyes hydrated and keeps concealer looking great all day. Still young so I use as a precautionary product, so can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t speak to reduction of fine lines.\\r\\nI love this line from belif, but I do admit the eye cream is my least favorite product. It seems like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as concentrated as I prefer. The scent also makes my eyes water a little bit, but nothing bad. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a bad product at all, but there are eye creams I like better.\\r\\nIf you love the aqua bomb moisturizer, you will love this! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a drink of water for my under eyes. You only need the tiniest bet and it layer nicely under my concealer without it moving around.\\r\\nYasssss!! By far the best eye cream I have used! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked in skin care for many years and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anything on the market that compares! Great smell! Super moisturizing! Helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles instantly!\\r\\nThis is the holy grail for eye creams by far! So effective at keeping them moisturized at night and during the day!\\r\\nJ\\xe2\\x80\\x99adore j\\xe2\\x80\\x99adore j\\xe2\\x80\\x99adore x100 vraiment c\\xe2\\x80\\x99est le meilleur contour des yeux que j\\xe2\\x80\\x99ai pu essay\\xc3\\xa9, il hydrate vraiment super bien, il est un peu cher, certes, mais je le rach\\xc3\\xa8terais direct, je l\\xe2\\x80\\x99ai bient\\xc3\\xb4t termin\\xc3\\xa9 et j\\xe2\\x80\\x99ai d\\xc3\\xa9j\\xc3\\xa0 pour projet de le racheter.

Not irritating.\\r\\nSoo moisturizing , and the tub lasts me forever! I use it at night since it can be pretty rich. Never irritates my eyes, and I have pretty sensitive eyes.\\r\\nLove this eye cream you can actually feel it working. You can feel the lift and eye looks brighter.\\r\\nI love how light and creamy this is! I like that it is light because the under eye skin in so delicate.\\r\\nThe eye mask makes my eyelids not puff anymore in the morning, which is good. But it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t light my black circle\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It really hydrates the under eye area. I have dry/combo skin and especially during the winter months it gets really dry, this eye cream is amazing. I use it mostly at night or when I\\'m prepping my face for make up, just when I need some extra moisturizer. It decreases the chance of looking cakey or my concealer creasing.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI love all of the Belif products I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried and this is no exception. Provides good moisture without being too heavy. Great day time eye cream.\\r\\nHOLY MOISTURE. I ADORE this eye cream!! I use at night so I wake up with hydrated supple under eyes.

I love the feel and smell and they work well. I feel very refreshed and moisturized and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a delightful feeling.\\r\\nThis product absorbs quickly and really moisturizes the under eye area.

My go to eye cream\\r\\nThis eye cream does not burn my eyes like other eye creams have. It moisturizes very well without being heavy. Nice under makeup as well.\\r\\nWow. Belif is one of my favorite skin care lines and the eye bomb doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t disappoint. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s light but feels like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really working, my eyes look great I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been very pleased so far!\\r\\nThis eye cream does not get rid or heal fine lines! It is a moisturizer for the under eye area and it is amazing! It is light weight so you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even notice it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on but it makes all the difference in moisturized that area\\r\\nThis is my Holy Grail eye cream especially in the winter months. The packaging is sturdy there\\'s a decent amount of product and it\\'s very moisturizing. It wears well under makeup also which is a bonus!\\r\\nBest eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used yet! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so cool and refreshing and I even put it in the fridge to give me an extra wake up lift in the morning ! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing\\r\\nThis eye cream works pretty well. Doesn\\'t irritate my sensitive skin and doesn\\'t burn. I use it twice daily. Could be more hydrating since I have extremely dry skin.\\r\\nFelt very moisturizing and sunk in quickly so you could apply makeup without it smearing.\\r\\nI have never used an eye cream specifically for moisture but I love this stuff. A little goes a long way. I didn\\'t notice a change in fine lines but that is likely due to the natural structure of my face. I would highly recommend this to moisturize the under eye, if you are looking for more of a fine line treatment I wouldn\\'t count on this doing the trick. Under eye area feels less \"crunchy\" under makeup.\\r\\nGreat moisturizing eye cream. I use this at night only to give extra hydration. Highly recommend\\r\\nThis is my absolute favorite eye moisturizer. I originally got a sample at Sephora and was instantly hooked. Really helped with fine lines and mild crepiness around my eyes.\\r\\nI have been using this eye cream day and night for about a month now. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as moisturizing as I would like but definitely moisturizes. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d buy it again because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had better ones. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in my 30s and looking for something super moisturizing to prevent my under eyes from looking creased at the end of a long day.\\r\\nComfortable, smooth, moisturizing and packaged well. Plenty of product and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t require an excessive amount on skin. Blend-able a simple\\r\\nSuper moisturizing and pleasant! Goes great under concealer to prevent fine lines and signs of dryness. The jar is huge, I thought it was a face moisturizer first so you do get a lot for your money. It quickly sinks into your skin and reduces morning puffiness\\r\\nIf you have dark circles, bags, or wrinkles under your eyes- YOU NEED THIS! Holy grail eye cream! I\\'m a mom and I really like this. My eyes look refreshed and makeup applies much smoother under my eyes now! Absolutely love!\\r\\nLeaves my under eyes so moisturized. Concealer and powder dries my under eyes and this repairs them amazing. Very gentle and easy to apply. Great for it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s price. I so recommend this product to others!!\\r\\nVery moisturizing and cooling! I love how it feels as my skin is sensitive and easily irritated.\\r\\nI really wanted to love the Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. (I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a huge fan of their other products!) Unfortunately, this just didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work with my skin and caused a few milia beneath my eyes. It felt amazing going on, and I had high hopes for it. But this would probably be better with a different skin type.\\r\\nUsed my Beauty Insider points from Sephora to get a sample size of this product and it is enough (in just the trial size) to probably last me the whole year, if not longer. It\\'s a great consistency and is perfect for dryness around the eyes. I would definitely recommend to another user with any skin type (I mostly have oily skin and it wasn\\'t overly oily, but still hydrated around the eyes well).\\r\\nthis product is very hydrating and has a very smooth texture. It feels good when applying it. However, if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sleep and drink water regularly, this product is not going to just make miracles happen.\\r\\nThis stuff is super bomb and works so well!! Got this as a sample in the Ipsy gem 2018 bag and I am in love. Now I am a consistent consumer and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live without it\\r\\nI love this product! I got it last Winter from Sephora during the VIB Rouge sale. At first, I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure it was doing anything except for cooling down my puffiness. I was wrong. After a few days I could see a visible change near my eye area- brighter, better, and even softer! Love this so much. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to repurchase!\\r\\nMy holy grail of holy grail eye creams. I love this stuff. It perfectly plumps up my under eyes without being greasy or too heavy. Helped majorly with my fine hydration lines which is my main concern and the tub is lasting forever. Definitely recommend!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure why this product gives me little white bumps under my eyes :( I love the scent of Belif products and most of there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products are great this one just doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work for me\\r\\nTHIS PRODUCT IS SO SO GOOD! Ahhhh I love it . It is a bit pricey but it works wonders. It past my expectations for sure. It is effective for sure. I really love it. I would but it again it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so amazing. Definitely recommend.\\r\\nI think this is a great product but just is not suitable for my skin. It worked nicely but was too rich for my combo-oily skin.\\r\\nI am a big fan of Belif ever since I got a sample of the Aqua Bomb moisturizer years ago. I love this too because it has the same airy gel-lotion consistency that their moisturizers have. To me, it smells very lightly of fresh lemon. I have used this daily since I got it & I will continue to purchase once I run out. It keeps my undereye area nicely hydrated & my skin soaks it up quickly. I\\'ve never been let down by any Belif products!\\r\\nNot sure it\\'s worth the splurge. I have to say, it definitely hydrates my under eye! But I see no difference in fine lines, or smoothing. I use it every morning before I apply my makeup. Maybe I\\'m not using it right? Not sure. Wondering why it had so much hype.\\r\\nA few weeks ago my eyes were extremely dry and I was experiencing a lot of dry patches underneath my eyes as well as on my eyelids. It was clear that the eye moisturizers I was using weren\\'t good enough so I decided to look through a few samples that I had and I came across this one. I immediately felt a difference and by the next day my dry patches were completely gone. I finished up the sample which lasted me quite a bit because you need so little product. And immediately afterwards I went and purchased a full size.\\r\\nI love Belif\\'s \"bomb\" line--everything from the aqua bomb moisturizer to this eye cream is awesome! I swear I can feel it cooling down my skin and relieving the stress of the day. It\\'s such a nice eye cream, smells great and actually works. Would definitely buy again.\\r\\nThis has become one of my holy grail, can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t-live-without daily skincare products as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extremely hydrating for my increasingly dry under-eye area and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a definite noticeable difference in the condition of my under-eye as far as fine lines and circles when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using this product morning and night versus the occasional bouts where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll forget to apply it as I normally would. When you also factor in that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s from a highly esteemed and well-known skincare brand and the amount of product you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting for the price, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely a bang for your buck in comparison to its likewise high-end alternatives. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve still yet to go through a single jar of this cream, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absolutely on my repurchase list whenever that time comes! I love the creamy, instantly refreshing texture it offers!\\r\\nFavorite eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating and not too heavy. I highly recommend. I love all the Belif products I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried.\\r\\nGreat moisturizing eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightweight and absorbs quickly. Works great under concealer and makeup. I use this daily every morning.\\r\\nLove this! It is very moisturizing and gets rid of dry eyes. It is very thin and not to thick so it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t clog pores. Good for wrinkles. Love using this at night to wake up with refreshed eyes and keep my dark circles away. Also perfect for the morning time.\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t generally use eyecreams, but this one was good. It hydrated my Crow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Feet and made my makeup not be as cakey around the eyes. Slightly expensive, but would get a small size in the future. I do recommend it.\\r\\nI really love the Belief Moisturizing Eye Bomb! After putting on my moisturizer in the morning, I like to put this eye cream under my way as-well as on my eyelid. It is very moisturizing and it\\'s such a thick cream that really hydrates my under eye. I have also applied this under make-up and it sets nicely. Although it is on the pricer side, the eye cream does come in a rather big tub and a little really goes a long way so I can assure you that you will have your eye cream for a LONG time lol.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI have 3 of these just so I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run out! Belif products are pretty dope. This one helps keep my eyes moisturized and hydrated.\\r\\nthis product is very light and soothing under the eyes ! it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s soaks in nicely and feels extremely refreshing\\r\\nSuper hydrating! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very thin but very effective. My skin soaked this in and thanked me later. It almost felt like my under eyes were plump and firming which was something I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know I was concerned with\\r\\nDEFINITELY MOISTURIZES THE EYE AREA.  THIS ALONG WITH THE PEAT REVITALIZE CREAM MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE.\\r\\nI am a huge fan of the Belif brand. The Aqua bomb moisturizer has been my nightly lotion for over a year. The eye bomb is extremely moisturizing as well and its consistency is very light and easily spreadable. I keep this product in my mini fridge which adds a nice cooling-depuffing aspect to it. Overall a great eye cream for dry undereyes! Works well under makeup as well.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis product is the absolute best. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my favorite part of my skincare routine. Super hydrating and gets rid of under eye bags. Also hides dark circles. Met all of my expectations. I would for sure recommend.\\r\\nThis is one of those products that I think it does something good but I really can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell. I apply before bed and wake up with less dull eyes (is that from adequate sleep or the product?) I would recommend to others just for how this product apply and feels on the skin. Very light and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel too oily.\\r\\nMy under eyes improved with a few uses. My makeup and concealer looked seamless. I would repurchase time after time!\\r\\nThis moisturizer has become a permanent staple in my quest to find a skin care routine that works for me. It really does the job and I have noticed a change in my skin since introducing it into my lineup!\\r\\nI absolutely fell in love with this product the very first time I used it. You can feel it once you put it on and then all of a sudden it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absorbed without any residue left behind. Hydrates your eye perfectly for makeup to be used on top. I currently have three of these; not a product I want to run out of!\\r\\nI absolutely love this eye cream. I doesn\\'t irritate my eyes like other eye cream. I have noticed a big difference in my under eye area.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis stuff is amazing! Moisturizing without being greasy, light for under the eye so it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look cakey when applying concealer. Definitely buying again!\\r\\nThis is a  great eye creme for those dry months! Highly recommend for those with dry/sensitive skin!\\r\\nI really like this eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super moisturizing but not greasy. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use very much so the value for what you get is good.\\r\\nWhat I\\'ve learned about eye creams is that if you want to see results better to purchase an expensive concealer. I don\\'t notice much of a difference. My biggest issue is dark circles. This doesn\\'t do anything for those. Notice some difference in puffiness,but luckily not many issues with that\\r\\nBest eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used so far. Not too heavy or sticky. I got this in a Christmas set and I will be buying a full size when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m done. I strongly recommend for dry/sensitive skin.\\r\\nI love Belif products! I love the feel and smell and they work well. I feel very refreshed and moisturized and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a delightful feeling.\\r\\nThis product absorbs quickly and really moisturizes the under eye area. It also reduces dark circles and decreases puffiness. Put on 10-15 mins before makeup to allow the product to fully sink into the skin. \\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nSuper hydrating on a long day without sleep and your tired. I love putting this in the fridge for the best results.\\r\\nLove how hydrating this product is under my eyes. A little bit of this product goes a long way and for the price, you can get a large number of uses out of it. While I love the way this feels and makes my under-eye look hydrated, the results aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t life changing for someone who has pretty hefty under eye bags.\\r\\nExtremely moisturizing and lightweight to wear under makeup. Great plus is that it comes in a pretty big size so it lasted me quite some time (I even use it 2x a day)\\r\\nThe eye bomb it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bomb. I got this for an example but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in love. For me was effective.\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It feels very soothing when you put it on, is hydrating and very gentle (doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make my eyes burn). The packaging is beautiful and it does exactly what it says it will. Will definitely repurchase.\\r\\nThis was the first eye cream/moisturizer I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used and still use it to this day.

I love the small ones you get in the travel size sets. I\\'m prone to milia and this hasn\\'t caused trouble for me.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nVery hydrating!! I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed any particular improvement in the eye or under eye area, but it is absolutely moisturizing as the product claims. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll continue using this product, but I am not sure I would purchase it with my own money.\\r\\nBest eye cream bomb everrrrr!!! I highly recommend it, this product would not disappoint you. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m never going back to try any other eye cream!!!!!\\r\\nThis is my all time favorite eye cream. It is so hydrating and rich, leaving a very moisturized under eye feeling! You only have to use a tiny bit of product to achieve a great result. No fragrance added so it is safe for sensitive skin. I would recommend this for anyone who would love to add more moisture to their under eye area.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis is a nice eye cream with no bells and whistles. Basic, gets the job doe, is a nice base for makeup. Not moisturizing enough, in my opinion, for more mature skin. \\r\\nI feel guilty but i actually use this as the mini size i got from the Belif set. I love it so much when I put it under my make it. It makes the fine lines less visible!!\\r\\nThis is a nice brand kind of middle of the road product I think.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this for about 3 months now on and off and I do like it. It has a nice moisturizing type feel it goes on very smooth and sinks  right in.  If you ar looking for just a bit more moisture then I highly recommend.\\r\\nLoving this eye cream. It feels so nice on my skin and dries quickly. I apply every night before bed and the skin in under eye area and on my lids feel smooth and hydrated after use.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to continue using this cream.\\r\\nMy go to eye cream for hydration! This super water gel eye cream is perfect for applying before concealer to make your under-eyes look flawless and crease free! Perfect for wearers of matte concealers like Nars soft matte concealer or shape tape! Believe me this will blow your mind! Apart from that this also helps with antioxidant protection so it will prevent aging from stressors like pollution and smoke!\\r\\nGot this as a sample and I love it, the texture is super thick and luxurious I love applying it\\r\\nI love this stuff. Ive used it day and night for MONTHS and have no complaints. It keeps the undereye nice and hydrated while not being too heavy. I can easily apply makeup over this fairly quickly after finishing my skin routine.\\r\\nWorks really well for under the eyes very hydrating and I love using this every morning and night. Very effective !\\r\\nI got a sample size to try of Belif Moisturizing Bomb. Packaging was standard for eye cream. It had a nice fresh scent. I found it to be a little tacky after I applied it, but my eyes felt refreshed. I would try a variation of Belif\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye creams again.\\r\\nSometimes I wake up feeling my eyes look tired but when I use this I can see the difference\\r\\nAt first when I started using this product it definitely helps with moisture under the eyes but ghasnt really done much for the lines under my eyes\\r\\nThis is scentless and comes in an easy to open plastic jar. The formula soaks into your skin and helps wake up your eyes. Over time it will help to minimize wrinkles. The directions say to use morning and night so that is what I do. I would definitively recommend this for an eye cream.\\r\\nI love this stuff! I think itsthe higher end version of neutrogena\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydrating under  eye cream. it feels very lush and gel-like under the eyes. i would buy again. it also is hydrating and smells pleasant!\\r\\nThis is very hydrating and does not leave any residue. It does not feel heavy. I find that it does smooth out my creases\\r\\nLove this eye cream. Not too heavy. Very hydrating. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad I tried this and will repurchase again.\\r\\nSuper light weight yet it still hydrates my under eyes! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed that my fine lines underneath my eyes are not at noticeable either.\\r\\nI absolutely love Belief products. Have used Aqua Bomb since it came out, so I had to give this a shot and I was not disappointed\\r\\nLove love love this product!!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part of my daily routine and I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live without it! I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s well worth the price and works very well on my dry skin during the winter. Currently travelling and had to bring my mini size with me!\\r\\nThis is def bomb! Just like the name! Locks in moistures and soaks in the skin! Belif products does not disappoint. Love that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s light weight and does not have a heavy fragrance. My skin is a bit sensitive but belif products does a great job always!\\r\\nHydrating, cooling, and not to thick! Everything you could want in a under eye moisturizer\\r\\nKeeps your under eyes looking fresh! Got this in the Merry Moisturizer kit and i love it!\\r\\ni do agree that this is the most moisturizing and hydrating eye cream i have EVER used, and hydrated under eyes means no circles or crows feet around the eyes so this helps with that a lot. HOWEVER....it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help with dark circles and puffiness which is a major concern of mine. it is good, just doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t meet up to the expectations i wanted. i do think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have those problems and just want really moisturized undereyes however.\\r\\nHydrating. I love using it under my concealer it makes the area smooth and ready for makeup. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in the pricey side, so keep an eye on it during sales.\\r\\nI received a sample with my online order from Sephora about a month ago - and I\\'m SO happy I did! I finally found an eye \"cream\" (this looks and feels different from your average cream) that isn\\'t gooey or too creamy, and doesn\\'t get into my eyes or irritate them - I have very sensitive skin and my eyes would get a red rim on the lower lash line with other eye products, but not this one! If you\\'ve had similar issues and are looking for something that actually hydrates (and well!) then you should definitely give this a try!\\r\\nAbsolutely love! Keeps my under eyes hydrated and firm without making my skin greasy! Perfect for daytime and nighttime\\r\\nThis is the only eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what got me started with the brand belif. I love the water based formula, it absorbs so we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll and makes my skin feel really light and refreshed. Being that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m young I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have anything under my eyes but I really believe using this will keep my under eye area healthy and smooth!\\r\\nI have mixed feelings about this product I wanted to love it but it was just meh. I felt like it never absorbed into my skin no matter how little I used it was always wet.\\r\\nI have used many I products over the years and I have really grown to like this product a lot. It keeps my eyes from looking crepey and also cuts down on the look of Fine Lines around my eyes\\r\\nSo much moisture! A tiny bit gently dabbed on your under eye truly goes a long way . It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for overnight or during the day. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice and cooling so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good for depuffing I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the morning prior to makeup\\r\\nI\\'m a believer now! Unfortunately, it\\'s a bit outside my price range to continuously purchase this. It is so effective for under eye dryness and discoloring. In the morning, my under eyes feel firm and hydrated.\\r\\nIt is a pretty light moisturizer that lasts you quite a long time, you only need a small pea size amount and apply it with your ring finger. I use it morning and night after cleansing my face and also before putting any makeup on to keep my under eyes hydrated.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nImagine...as you get older you get wrinkles! \\xc2\\xa0I havent been good to my skin over the years (58) \\xc2\\xa0but now is my time! \\xc2\\xa0I am trying different products and reading alot about skin care. I like this eye bomb and wish I had taken an interest in eye care in my 20\\'s. I have not used this bomb enough to give more info.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI am new to this product and I absolutely LOVE IT. Its sooo hydrating and moisturizing on my dry sensitive eye area especially in the winter! It feels so soothing on my skin. No greasy feeling. Absolutely recommend!\\r\\nI absolutely love this product, it is by far one of the best products I\\'ve tried. It is a fantastic Moisturizer and helped with dark spots under my eyes.\\r\\nI am huge \"belifer\". All of their products are flawless. This does exactly what its suppose to do and makes my eyes feel great and well rested.\\r\\nIt feels amazing and cool when applied. It absorbs very quickly and is very hydrating. I got a sample and will be getting the full size soon.\\r\\nI got this as a free sample from Sephora and now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m investing in the full size! This product is definitely hydrating - especially after a night on the town. This product makes my eyes look bright and helps with my dark circles!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m definitely a belifer \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa6 This under eye cream is amazing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s packed with moisture and absorbs quickly. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave your skin feeling greasy or it has a fresh smell. A little of the product goes a looong way.\\r\\nI really really love this eye product! It is so light and not greasy at all and a little dot goes a long way. I applied this eye bomb before my concealer and powder. And when I did apply my makeup, it went on smoothly and my puffiness was diminished. My wrinkles were not noticeable. The best thing is that my eyes are not irritated or teary. This product is worth  the money I spent, $48.00. It may be pricey but I am not complaining.\\r\\nThis is hands down the best eye cream you can try! Fine lines, dark circles, puffiness completely gone. Apply before bed, and wake up completely transformed.\\r\\nI think this eye cream is fabulous. In the past other products have given me tiny bumps around my eyes but this hasn\\'t. It is super moisturizing and luxurious. My makeup even seems to sit smoother and nicer under my eyes. I love this stuff and need to order another as mine is starting to get low!\\r\\nThis is a really nice eye cream to help plump and hydrate the under eye. It is a nice gel like consistency that really helps to draw in moisturizer, and does an amazing job smoothing fine lines and puffiness under makeup.\\r\\nHands down my favorite eye cream! Leaves my under eye feeling hydrated and smooth. It\\'s very lightweight and a little goes a long way!\\r\\nFor the money I really enjoy this eye cream. My skin is dry and this is incredibly moisturizing.  I first received this in my play box and decided to buy after I used the sample.\\r\\nI received it as a sample and after using it I was completely convinced to buy it as a full sized product. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extremely hydrating.\\r\\nVery moisturizing under eye cream. I apply this every night to the entire eye area and again in the morning with another eye cream if my eyes are extra dry. It really helps prevent flaking and diminishes the look of fine lines - even after makeup application! The formula is lightweight, non-greasy, and applies like a dream. Although it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s described as a cream, it feels more like a gel. There is subtle, fresh scent and a pleasant cooling sensation upon application. This really is a value product because you get so much in the jar (25 ml) and only need a pea size amount to cover the entire eye area. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see myself running out any time soon but I will definitely re-buy when I do!\\r\\nOnly thing that keeps my under eyes from looking dry and cracking!! super hydrating and makeup applies beautifully over top\\r\\nKeeps my eyes feeling awake and moisturized without being heavy. Would recommend to any skin type.\\r\\nThis is my favorite eye cream to wear on my no makeup days. It is perfect for winter. Normally, the area under my eyes gets immensely dry and chapped in the winter, but I started wearing this in the winter at night and on my no makeup days, and I haven\\'t experienced that at all! It is super creamy so if you do plan to wear it under makeup, make sure to wait at least 30 minutes while drinking some coffee or eating breakfast or something to let it absorb into the skin and dry down a bit. This will help prevent it belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb  from compromising your foundation.\\r\\nI use this every night and my eye bags seem to look better finally LOL lack of sleep . But I love using this in the am and pm ! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great and belief is one of the best brands out there !\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ok. It does moisturize but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any other difference. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather not pay this much for something that does not have that much effect.\\r\\nGreat eye cream, doesn\\'t interfere with concealer or other makeup application! It\\'s a light, gel texture but surprisingly hydrating. Sinks into the skin quickly!\\r\\nI really like this eye moisterizer better than most I\\'ve tried. At first it made my eyes look brighter but over time the effects have lessened.\\r\\nI like this product and love the way it feels going on.\\xc2\\xa0 It\\'s almost like a gel (which I really love around my eye area).\\xc2\\xa0 It did a good job of moisturizing, but I was really looking for a little more help from an eye cream.\\xc2\\xa0 I did not experience any sensitivity while using this product.\\r\\nHave been using this product for about 3 weeks now and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that I see a huge difference with my eyes but it is definitely super comfortable and hydrating! Will be purchasing again as it is one of the better kinds I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried!\\r\\nMy favorite eye cream for the day time! It hydrates without being too heavy and my makeup glides on like a dream overtop\\r\\nThis is a wonderfully light formula that absorbs well into the skin. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect for morning routines as the finish is smooth and not sticky. This plumps the skin around my eyes, and this jar lasts for forever!\\r\\nThe price is affordable but I am not in love with this product. I would prefer a creamier eye cream. I use it for bed when I do use it.\\r\\nI use this every single day before I go to sleep. This keeps my eyes from getting puffy in the morning, reduces the darkness under my eyes, and also keeps my fine lines hydrated while I sleep. It lasts the entire night and I wake up every morning still hydrated.\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely worth the price and a little goes a long way!\\r\\nIt made my skin flakey and dry. It also changed the texture for a while. I quit using it soon after I realized what the reason for these things were.\\r\\nI got a sample size of this in a Sephora Play bag a few months ago and I just now got around to using/finishing it.  This is a nice eye cream and I really enjoyed using it. However I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find it to be better than other eye products that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used before so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably keep it moving and try out other creams versus purchasing the full size.\\r\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for what the name says it does. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very moisturizing but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look for it to help with under eye bags etc. but if you are looking for a moisturizer that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s safe and effective look no further.\\r\\nI got this product because I love Belif Aqua Bomb moisturizer and this is a very similar formula. It applies like a nice water gel and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my sensitive eyes. I would have given it 5 stars but it is a little thinner/lighter than I prefer my eye creams.\\r\\nThis stuff is good for puffyness and wrinkles but broke me out where I put it so I stopped using it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too heavy for me I think.. I prefer lighter\\r\\nI love this balm! It smells amazing and leaves my eyes moisturized without feeling too heavy. You get a good amount for the price.\\r\\nthis is the nicest eye cream i have ever tried!! SO SO hydrating, i apply it once a day and my undereyes look perfect (and not like i\\'m only getting 4 hours of sleep a night). it\\'s expensive but lasts for so long.\\r\\nI got this in a travel size when I bought another full sized belif product, and I was pleasantly surprised! It is very hydrating and it goes on well and absorbs into my skin without making it feel to thick. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m definitely considering buying the full size when I run out\\r\\nMy end all be all eye cream! This is my holy grail eye cream. I have VERY dry, textured under eyes and this has made a huge difference in the appearance. I still can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbake\\xe2\\x80\\x9d my under eye because of the dryness, but this cream has much such a significant difference! I always have a back up because I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go a day without it. For reference to see if this might work for you...other eye creams that work well for me are drunk elephant and it cosmetics bye bye under eye cream.\\r\\nI honestly \\xc2\\xa0fell in love with this product and the brand when I was having the worst skin year \\xc2\\xa0 Everything that I was putting on my face burn Except this product. It help me out \\xc2\\xa0so much because my under eyes were so dry that I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even \\xc2\\xa0wear concealer because it would just look all dry and patchy . this literally saved me I put this on right befor I go to sleep and wake up with flawless undereyes\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis is okay. Feels light, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t moisturize that well. Dries really quick. Smells great though!\\r\\nThis is one of the best eye creams out there!! It is much more affordable than other eye creams in sephora. It really moisturizes your under eye. It makes concealer applied under the eye look amazing and very healthy. I would recommend this eye to almost everyone since its also not too heavy.\\r\\nThis stuff is amazing! I use the face cream every day morning and night and this is part of my routine as well!\\r\\nThe eye bomb was very moisturizing and also cooling, so I felt that it de-puffed the under eye area well. The smell is very nice, and I love belif\\'s packaging. I love jars for my under eye products because I can scoop my ring finger in easiest.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nOh boy I love this stuff, I got a sample size and it lasted me almost a whole year with consistent application. What I love about it is that it is not greasy and it helps my eyes stay moisturized. My mom is 52 and she said this helped with her crows feet. The best part is that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave little white bumps under my skin around my eyes. Also for the price, you are getting two times what you would get for a standard eye cream from a department store. Highly recommend!! I love belif.\\r\\nfeels smooth and light. I have sensitive skin, but this product works well for me and does not irritate my eyes.\\r\\nI love this product so much. I honestly use it all over my face not just my eyes. It is VERY moisturizing but also doesn\\'t make my skin oily. the only thing i will say is that a few minutes after you put it on it might make your skin feel a bit sticky until it absorbs. It is a little expensive but i would buy again.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nHaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really notice a difference just yet, as I just started using it this week. It apply\\xe2\\x80\\x99s well, smooth and not tacky/sticky.\\r\\nThis worked so well! It made my under eye so smooth and soft and also helped get the wrinkles out from under my eyes! It also smells great! I would recommend using it!\\r\\nI am now obsessed with this product. I\\'ve never really felt like I needed an under eye product (except I\\'m chronically tired so I do have some puff) so every time I tried one it was just disappointing and didn\\'t do much for me. Once I tried this, I became a believer. This is so moisturizing, smoothing, depuffing, and lightweight! You don\\'t need a lot which makes the price pretty worth it, because it does last a good while even if you use it daily! It has no smell or weird texture, just a simple eye cream that packs a great punch.\\r\\nI use this eye cream nightly and keep it in the refrigerator so it feels nice and cool when I apply it. \\xc2\\xa0I don\\'t see any major difference other than my skin feeling nice and hydrated...but I don\\'t think there are any other major benefits. \\xc2\\xa0I don\\'t think I would repurchase.\\r\\nSeriously saw improvement with my under eye creasing overnight. I pair this with Vaseline during the winter months and it never disappoints. A definite HG purchase!\\r\\nThis product was GREAT!! It provided so much moisture to my under eyes it was phenomenal! The jar comes with a ton of product so I think it\\'s definitely worth the higher price tag for an eye cream. The only drawback I have is that the packaging is so bulky, it\\'s not all that great to travel with.\\r\\nOk so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and i am obsessed! I apply at night and in the morning my eyes feel 10x less puffy and they are way more hydrated. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helped with creasing I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d make up in my under eyes which is something I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always struggled with! So amazing for real guys. Glad it lived up to the hype!\\r\\nThis feels absolutely amazing under my eyes! I have a very problematic under eye area and this helps to hydrate and gets rid of my fine lines. I only have a trial size of this but will definitely repurchase when I run out!\\r\\nExcellent under eye product. Absorbs quickly! Lightweight but very moisturizing. Simple packaging. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d repurchase again.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI absolutely love this I cream! It really moisturize my face and is soft to apply. I have noticed a more firm skin in my eyes.\\r\\nI receive this from influenster for trial purposes. I have only skin and if I use during the day it can make my skin even oilier than usual, however, I learned that the best time to use it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s during nighttime. I apply prior going to bed and I wake up feeling reinvigorated.\\r\\nThis is a great product. I suffer from dry under eyes and this is very moisturizing. It is great worn alone or under makeup\\r\\nVery soothing, cooling feeling, seemed to reduce eye bags slightly so would purchase again\\r\\nThis is probably my favorite eye cream that I have ever tried. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in my mid 20s so my main concerns are hydration and preventing wrinkles. This hydrates my under eyes really nicely and I can notice a difference in my skin when I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use this. The jar is worth the price because it lasts a long time since you only need a very small amount.\\r\\nEst\\xc3\\xa1 crema es muy buena para los ojos sobre todo cuando estoy cansada me ayuda a reducir el color oscuro de mis ojeras la recomiendo\\r\\nA little greasy for daytime but great for nighttime use. I suffer from dry eyelids during the winter and this has helped immensely without burning like other eye creams have. Both my undereye and eyelids feel better and softer and less dry.\\r\\nThis product is amazing. It is extremely lightweight and very hydrating. I also like that it is not greasy.\\r\\nI LOVE this product! The lightweight, gel-like texture feels great on your skin! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice change up from heavy moisturizing cremes!\\r\\nI absolutely love Belif products and this product has become part of my nightly routine! I love how clean this feels, it\\'s a gel-like\\xc2\\xa0texture but very water-like feeling. It\\'s so easy to apply and blends like a dream and leaves your under eyes\\xc2\\xa0feeling nice and moisturized before bed! It is super affordable especially for the quality you are getting! If you\\'re in the market for an amazing eye \"cream\" give this a try!\\r\\nI love this eye cream! I got it in a monthly subscription box but I am definitely going to get a full size to purchase when this is out. I am at the age where I have fine lines so this is a great product to use.\\r\\nA staple in my skincare routine! I apply at night and wake up feeling refreshed. It is gentle, has a mild smell and easily melts into your skin\\r\\nVery great eye mask! Gentle and super hydrating. I love how I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need much of the product and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cooling on my eyes so it hydrates as well as reduces my eye bags.\\r\\nThis is an okay eye cream. Got a few samples in my Ulta order and used it for about a couple weeks. Didn\\'t see any changes but I like that it was not too greasy and it didn\\'t sting my eyes.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis was one of the first eye creams that I ever tried and I was in love. It is not harsh on the eyes and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very effective. The packaging is so nice. I dabbed my finger in there. You only need a tiny amount and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re good. It gives so much moisture. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a definitely staple in your routine.\\r\\nBring my under eyes to life! My friends gave this to me because she knew I was having skin troubles and it was perfect timing!! This stuff is rich, yet refreshing and gives the skin plumpness. Love! Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to buy it for myself.\\r\\nVery hydrating. Helps plump up the under eyes to make fine lines less visible. I got this in a set with their moisturizer which is my favorite. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if I will repurchase when I run out, may try something new.\\r\\nVery hydrating and smells nice. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really see any difference on the appearance of my under eyes, but my under eyes always feel moisturized!\\r\\nBeen using this eye bomb for a while now. The jar with last you a while since a little goes a long way! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good value for how much product you get. I love the way it makes my under eyes feel and how it wears underneath makeup!\\r\\nThis is my first eye cream. I got a sample with a holiday pack of their moisturizer. I was not disappointed. You can feel it working right away. A little bit goes a long way. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a 5mL sample and I know I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get at least 3 weeks of use out of it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using it night and day. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll def buy the full size when this finishes.\\r\\nI was honestly hoping for more. Yes, it moisturizes, but like.... so do drugstore products. If I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m paying this much for a product, I expect it to make more of a difference. Also, I just purchased this in December  and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even use it every day but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost gone. Not much product and not enough of an impact for me to repurchase.\\r\\nI am trying to judge this the best I can because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deal with severe undereye dryness or huge dark circles on a regular basis. However, I went through the entire trial size of this using it every morning and night and my undereyes were always moisturized. It has a gel texture and soaks in nicely. Does not leave a sticky residue. Recommend! I got this as a sample in my Sephora Play box!\\r\\nBest eye cream ever. Totally worth the price and makes a huge difference in color, skin texture, and overall appearance of eyes!\\r\\nLoved using this before putting on my makeup! It is so smooth and light. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cake up at all!\\r\\ni got a little version for free bc i had gotten another product but i dont believ this actually did anything? or at least i did not notice anything also i didnt use it for a couple days (i used it a couple times to see if there was a change) and i opened it and it was hard??? wouldnt really recommend but also i know people swear it helps them\\r\\nThis is my favorite eye cream that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried so far. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very moisturizing, and I have seen improvement in fine lines.\\r\\nI use this product every day and it has kept my face refreshed and glowing for the day. I definitely will buy it agin!\\r\\nBest hydrating eye cream for daily use. I apply this in the morning, it is gentle, non irritating and keeps my eye area smooth and plump. It exceeded my expectations.\\r\\nThis is amazing! Some eye creams give me milia but not this one. The area around my eye was so dry that it was flaking and this cleared it right up. This is the best winter eye cream\\r\\nBelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is an extremely refreshing gel type moisturizer. This gel texture leaves the delicate eye area well hydrated.\\r\\nLove the hydration this product gives me! I have been receiving sample sizes of this product and even the sample sizes last me a while since a little goes a long way! I apply it before my facial moisturizer step in my skincare routine and I have found that it brings life back around my eyes. Would definitely recommend and I will be purchasing the full size once I am through my samples.\\r\\nEste hidratante de ojos es realmente maravilloso, su textura es muy ligera, pero hidrata much\\xc3\\xadsimo, es uno de los contornos de ojos que m\\xc3\\xa1s me ha gustado y clara que seguir\\xc3\\xa9 utilizando. S\\xc3\\xbaper recomendado.\\r\\nLove this eye cream! Not as thick as the firming one so great for more everyday use. Love the way it glides on so smoothly. This paired with the aqua bomb face moisturizer is amazing!\\r\\nI love how hydrating the belif moisturizing eyebomb is however I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a fan of the gel like texture and consistency. When it drys if kinda balls up and flakes off and feels really strange on your face. Even if you put cream over it. Not my fav\\r\\nLightweight moisture that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ball up under concealer. Not sure it has any anti-aging effects, but I use other things for that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 this is mainly my daytime eye cream.\\r\\nThe best moisturizing eye cream! It makes your under-eye area so smooth. Makeup sits so well on top of this product.\\r\\nThis eye cream is expensive but definitely worth the money. I love how it makes my under eyes feel. I use it before I apply makeup and I find that my concealer goes on flawlessly. It really is very hydrating.\\r\\nAnother holy grail product of mine ! This makes the under eye soft and moisturized.  I am obsessed with this line !\\r\\nI have extremely dry under eyes, and eczema prone skin. I had given up on eye creams until I tried a sample of this. A little goes a long way and definitely helps keep my under eye and eyelids hydrated all day. Definitely will be a repeat purchase for me!\\r\\nI love this product. My eyes have dark circles but they have lightened a bit. I got a sample from Sephora so it is a great value. It is gentle and gets rid of some lines. i have sensitive skin and it doesn\\'t burn. I like the color and the shape and that it looks like lip balm. I might buy the full size.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nthis feels great on my skin. it also made my dark circles go away a little. i love this.\\r\\nFavorite eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so moisturizing and makes my under eyes smooth. I use in my night routine. You get a good amount of product for the price. I would recommend giving this a try if you are looking for a new eye cream\\r\\nI got this as a sample with my Sephora insider points. I love it!!! I use it in my morning skincare routine and my make up sits so perfectly over it. It makes me look hydrated throughout the day. It feels very luxurious.\\r\\nThis product retains moisture up to 26 hours is dermatologically tested and is a true herbal cosmetic brand.\\r\\nLeaves my under-eye area plump and hydrated. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel greasy and it is lightly scented! Great stuff!\\r\\nI love the feel and texture of this eye cream. I consider it to be affordable compared to other brands. It has a nice fresh clean scent and it absorbs nicely without feeling greasy. I would highly recommend it. It has a 12 month shelf life which is great!\\r\\nThis product does an amazing job moisturizing your under eyes and eye lid. This is a go to for me when my eyes feel dry and dehydrated.\\r\\nI received this product free for testing purposes and fell on love. I recently ran out of my complimentary one and went out and purchased it on my own. It leaves my under eyes feeling smooth and soft and keeps them hydrated. I would recommend this product.\\r\\nBought this as part of a mini travel set Sephora was selling and I really love it. It helps to moisturize my under eyes and I\\'m starting to use it during the day to help with the dry winter.\\r\\nI use this twice a day and it works to moisturize my undereyes. My husband uses this twice a day too and also loves the product! A little goes a long way and the product has a lot of good value for the price. I also love the packaging!\\r\\nI received this in one of my beauty subscription boxes and I have been absolutely LOVING it!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been lasting me quiet a while because a little of bit goes a long way! It keeps my undereyes so moisturized and hydrated! And the scent of this product is so refreshing ! Highly recommend !\\r\\nI cannot rave enough about this ! I needed an eye cream and i got a sample at Sephora. Truly life changing. My concealer goes on so smoothly after using the eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so moisturizing especially in the winter and is just amazing!! Spend the money and get it!!!\\r\\nIt has a great texture and smells really good. It moisterizes really well I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure if it helps with wrinkles or puffiness cause I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see a drastic change when I started using it since I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still young\\r\\nHoly grail of eye products. I use this every night and every morning! It is a beautiful and lightweight texture that is very gel like. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m definitely going to buy it again when I run out, but so far it has lasted me over 4 months and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m only half way through. So you definitely get a lot of product!\\r\\nLove this stuff! Won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t break the bank and is super hydrating. 100% recommend, especially to those of you who have dry under eyes.\\r\\nI have never been a skincare junky but this definitely kick started my skin care journey. I love how it feels. I usually put it on at night before bed. I wake up with super soft under eyes. (I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m prone to dry skin).\\r\\nThis stuff is the bomb. I noticed a difference in texture after the first use. My under eyes get quite dry and this moistened them right up.\\r\\nLOVE LOVE LOVE this moisturizer. Extremely light on the skin and absorbs super fast. Love the light fresh scent as well. I can definitely feel the hydration the next morning when I apply it at night. I would\\'ve never tried this product if it wasn\\'t for influenster. Now I am hooked and buying a full size!\\r\\nI love this gentle soothing eye cream. I use it whenever my eyes get dry - particularly on those harsh cold days as winter approaches. I only need a little product and it goes a long way! Finally, my eyes are just as moisturized as my face!!\\r\\nThis eye bomb works well for me. It  didn\\'t remove my dark circles but they were much less visible. I like the texture a lot\\r\\nI love this eye cream. The results could be a bit better, but i love how it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.\\r\\nThis is probably one of the most hydrating eye creams I have ever used. The ingredients are great and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not overly scented. First time user and a lifelong one now.\\r\\nThis product is hydrating and light weight. I see a difference between using this daily and trying something new. I tend to always go back to the eye bomb.\\r\\nThis product isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t awful, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also not life-changing either. The packaging is nice, the scent is nice, & feels hydrating when you put it on; it feels hydrating when you first put it on, but my under eyes are still somewhat dry when I wake up in the morning. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just using this product up until I finish it...probably will not be repurchasing :(\\r\\nHas a really nice feel on the skin. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice any major change in bags or darkness but definitely was moisturizing to the skin and added softness\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis is my holy grail eye cream. It feels SO extremely hydrating and refreshing under my eyes. I love putting this on morning AND night. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen such a difference in my eyes as well!\\r\\nI got this as a sample size from Sephora and immediately became obsessed with it. It is so hydrating. I am not sure if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cooling or if it just feels cold to me because of where I store it, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incredible. I use it at morning and at night. My concealer goes on so smoothly, and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to worry about cakes or dry/tired looking eyes anymore!\\r\\nThis is one of my favorite skin care products! Super light, non greasy, and absorbs quickly. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great to use before applying makeup, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed when I used it as an eye primer it makes application much smoother and reduces makeup caking in fine lines\\r\\nI really love this eye cream, perfect for priming under eyes for make up. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used but it is worth using\\r\\nI love this stuff!! I haven\\'t tried a belif product yet I did not like, and this one didn\\'t disappoint!\\xc2\\xa0 Would purchase again.\\r\\nThis is currently my favorite eye cream. My main areas of concerns are my under eyes which tend to get super dry. This eye bomb works best to keep my eyes hydrated. I noticed improvement in my skin the first week I tried this eye cream. I highly recommend this.\\r\\nFavorite eye cream. So smooth. Light. Sinks into skin. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cause bumps under my eye. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my eyes either.\\r\\nThis is a very moisturizing cream. I love how it feels under my eyes. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel too heavy but not too light either. Really hydrates my under eyes. Sometimes, I put it all over my face and it feels great.\\r\\nWhen using this as an overnight eye cream, I found that it just made my under eyes sticky and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much for hydration. It did not meet my expectations for such a pricey product\\r\\nI got this in the sample size and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be repurchasing it but mostly due to the fact that I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want need more moisturized under-eyes. It did little to nothing to brighten my eyes and if you have a good moisturizer I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think this product is necessary\\r\\nNice eye cream, very moisturizing (lol I mean, it\\'s in the name), but outside of being a decent moisturizer, it\\'s nothing extraordinary. I like the texture and the way it absorbs, so if all you need is that, this would suit your needs fine. I\\'m getting to the point where I need something that would plump up fine lines around my eyes, and this doesn\\'t really do the trick, so perhaps a good fit for someone in their early to mid twenties that wants a nice hydrating eye cream with a smooth, light texture.\\r\\nThis is a pretty good eye product. Very hydrating. I use it every other day because I use alot of face products. Good buy.\\r\\nit really does moisturize for a long time! i dont have much experience with eye cream except for an eye cream i used years ago from wish (dont recommend buying skincare from wish, dont know what they put in there) this is very moisturizing and smells pretty good! i received a small sample in my sephora birthday gift. the cream smells fresh with a minty vibe\\r\\nThis whole line is my new favorite. I love this eye cream. It keeps you hydrated but not oily\\r\\nI really, really like this product. It feels light on the skin and fairly moisturizing. I think I\\'m going to try one of their other eye products though, so I can find one that works better for anti aging and fine lines.\\r\\nA great eye cream its moisturizes without clogging pores. I saw noticable different in my skin after using it\\r\\nI am almost running out of my first pot of this product and need to get a replacement ASAP. It leaves my under eyes baby-soft, and helps my under eye concealer go on smoothly.\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is the bomb! I got this sample in my iPSYbag & love it. It is slightly greasy but is very moisturizing for my tired wrinkly eyes. It doesnt burn like many eye moisturizers & a little goes a long way. I definitely want to try more products from @belifcanada !\\r\\nThis is my most recent addition to my skincare routine line and pile of skincare products. I decided to splurge on this during the Sephora Holiday promotion sale. I\\'ve been thinking about purchasing an eye cream and started adding it to my skincare regimen. I\\'m in my twenties so at this age, I do not have any wrinkles yet. But I wanted to start working on prevention. I did a lot of research while deciding which eye cream brand to get. I\\'ve used this for a while now and while I like the product, I have to be honest and say the results aren\\'t apparent. I mean, I don\\'t have eye wrinkles so I guess the results won\\'t be instant like some who say they saw differences in their wrinkles or dark circles. I do have dry skin in the winter, so this product is good at keeping my skin hydrated. While I don\\'t think this product is giving me instant results, I do think this will help my skin in the long term and work on prevention of wrinkles. When I apply it after my moisturizer, I feel a cooling sensation. This might feel good for those with tired eyes. This product is definitely a splurge at $48 for a tiny bottle. This product does go a long way since it\\'s only used in the eye area, which is a small area. A little product goes a long way!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nMy undereyes feel moisturised but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything great for my dark circles. Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my eyes.\\r\\nMuy ligera. Yo tengo muy seca el area de las ojeras y por eso no me gusto mucho. Creo que seguir\\xc3\\xa9 probando otras\\r\\nGreat for my eyes. I always wake up with little Crustees and dry around my eyes. This instantly gives me moisture\\r\\nI received this eye bomb from Influenster a while back and have been using it every night ever since. It makes my eyes feel refreshed and I have noticed a slight reduction in my wrinkles. I plan to keep it as a part of my nightly routine.\\r\\nThis is very creamy and moisturizing. It feels good on my under eyes.. I can tell a big difference in my under eyes when I apply concealer. It applies nice and smooth. Wish it was a little cheaper, but it is nice.\\r\\nReally enjoyed the intense moisture provided by this product! It kept my under eye area hydrated throughout the day and improved the appearance of fine lines. I felt like my concealer still slightly creased when layered on top though, and it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything for the appearance of dark circles.\\r\\nsimple eye cream....but the simplicity feels like it makes this eye cream very effective! skin around eye area is moisturized and it\\'s not too heavy where i would get milia\\r\\nI tried this as a sample and a ton of product came in it! I use this everyday as an eye cream and usually eye creams will break me out but this one does not. My eyes are hydrated as the product claims to do.\\r\\nvery hydrating. i love this stuff. i have very dry, dark under eyes so i put this on before bed every night and it has definitely made my under eyes softer and more hydrated, would recommend to those with under eyes like mine.\\r\\nThis eye cream is thebomb.com. I love using it under my eyes to avoid any dry or flaky skin issues during the cold winter months. And there is a ton of product in this size!\\r\\nThis is a very refreshing product. I used it for a while but never really saw a difference. I am not disappointed because it felt good when I put it underneath my eyes at night. Which I could have seen results to give this a better review.\\r\\nI find that if I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use this product, my under eye cakes. This could be because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m dry throughout the winter. I make sure to add this around my nose as well as I tend to get cakey there as well\\r\\nThis product is great for when I want to brighten up my under eye area. This product is light and soaks in quickly so you don\\'t need to worry about your makeup moving around on top of it if you apply in the morning! I would recommend this product to those who want a great hydrating eye cream.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI love how light this eye cream is. The consistency is closer to a gel. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use rich eye creams as I get a lot of milia around my eyes.\\r\\nLove this eye cream! I have super sensitive skin and over the winter my eczema tends to act up, so when I did start using this my skin got a little irritated around my eye. I let my husband use it instead and it made all the difference for his eye area! Super hydrated!!\\r\\nCreamy and lovely - I wear it overnight, especially in the winter, to keep my eye area bright and refreshed.\\r\\nSuper moisturizing and i never have to worry about it clogging my pores. It\\'s also very light weight and never feels heavy\\r\\nI love how this actually soaks into my skin. It feels hydrating and lightweight. It also wears well under makeup. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure if it does what it advertises since I only had a sample size but I would purchase.\\r\\nThe texture this product has is so perfect. It feels amazing, refreshing, it absorbs right away, it leaves your skin feeling so moisturized, and makeup applies beautifully on top. Highly recommend it for anyone with dry skin under their eyes.\\r\\nThis is one of the most soothing and moisturizing eye creams I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used. I love belif\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products and this one is no exception. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had the same tub for over a year. A little goes a long way. Definitely a repurchase when my skin needs hydration.\\r\\nThe best lightweight moisturizing eye cream! I recommend this to everyone. Affordable as well. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave the greasy feel\\r\\nWOW. I\\'ve been looking for an under eye moisturizer that fights dryness, doesn\\'t irritate my sensitive skin, and reduces the appearance of fine lines (I\\'m only 22, where did these even come from??). So far no luck - that is until I received this sample from Sephora. I used it at night 4 times so far and I really see a difference. The lines under my eyes aren\\'t as noticeable and the color of my dark circles appears to be lighter. It\\'s really made me feel better about my skin in only four uses. I wouldn\\'t recommend using it under makeup even though it is light for two reasons. One, its still a moisturizer and doesn\\'t dry/sink in very fast. This can clash with your concealer or foundation and look oily or streaky. Second, the first night I put it on I stayed up for little bit and noticed\\xc2\\xa0 that it got clumpy and looked like scales, by touching it it rolled off...pretty gross. However, when I put it on before bed I wake up bright eyed with smooth skin. Overall, the price point for the actual product is a real pain. If you can get it on sale I DEFINITELY recommend. if you don\\'t mind dropping $50 on an eye cream it\\'s worth it as well.\\r\\nI was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product. It was my first time using this brand and the price point is fair. Also my skin hydrated and glowing and the product stayed put. More than I can say for my higher dollar eye cream. This is my new fave.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of my everyday skin care products, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my first time using it and I really love this product, my eyes looks more hydrated. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very effective product and i highly recommend this, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll buy it again\\r\\nI love this product! Not only does it smell great but it is super hydrating. You only need a tiny bit and your eyes instantly feel moisturized and good to go! I apply it every night before bed and I definitely have noticed that the bags under my eyes are less noticeable in the mornings!\\r\\nThis product is awesome!! Super hydrating and really notice a difference in undereye circles.\\r\\nThis is a very moisturizing product , however I think it is too heavy for the under eye area. It can cause milia and heaviness under there instead of brightening . I like the moisture it brings although I wish it was lighter. However i just use this in the winter on my face instead !\\r\\nI love this eye cream! It feels amazing on my eyes every night before I go to bed! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great value with the size of the jar and the quality of belief products is always high!\\r\\nThis is hands down my favorite eye moisturizer! This product lasted so long as well! Kept my eyes moisturized all day, especially during the dry months here in the Midwest! I would recommend this product to anyone!\\r\\nThis eye cream is nice and hydrating but it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t blow me away. It would be good for someone who is just starting to use eye creams since it is pretty basic.\\r\\nGot this in a kit and really enjoy the hydration it gives my eyes during the colder months. Moderately priced-honestly about the same as play\\r\\nI use this on my under eyes everyday and it definitely helps with hydrating this delicate area. I definitely use it when I use a foundation and/or concealer that may dry out the skin in this area. It keeps my under eye area from looking creasy and dried out. I also love the way it feels when you first apply it, it has a cooling affect. Love using this product and will continue to buy it.\\r\\nSo moisturizing and not greasy at all. Leaves my eyes feeling awake and refreshed. Frangrence is subtle\\r\\nThis is a nice eye cream for dry skin and tired looking eyes. My skin can get a little oily, so I prefer to use this at night. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got an incredible moisturizing gel-like texture. Goes on smooth, easy to apply, and you really feel your skin soaking up the moisture after use.\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how much I got my sample from the makeup even and I love the feel of this cream leaves my eye refresh after washing off all the make up.\\r\\nI took 1 star off simply for the price. This stuff is amazing. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m prone to extremely dry skin under my eyes (and hand area) and this stuff is awesome. My under eye area was plump and extremely hydrated the next morning.  I had received this in my Sephora Play! Box and wish the price wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so steep to purchase the full sized version.\\r\\nThis is nice and light weight. Hydrated and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t break me out. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t beat the price!\\r\\nVery nice moisturizing cream for the eye area. Lightweight yet effective. My eyes get very dry during fall/winter season so this product helps to replenish the moisture. I would recommend this product.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in love with this eye bomb. It works wonders.   My under eyes look so much better every single time I use it. I love the packaging is super gentle on my eyes it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t burn or anything like that.\\r\\nLove this product!! I used it at night all over my face and woke up to glowing plump skin\\r\\nReally good! I bought mine a few months ago in a trip to Boston and I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stopped using ever since. Light weight, my under eye skin feels smooth and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve started to notice that my eye bags are improving. Love it!\\r\\nThe most moisturizing eye cream I\\'ve ever used! And it says so well under makeup. I have definitely repurchased multiple times.\\r\\nFreaking obsessed with this eye cream! First time I tried it I wasn\\'t into it because I thought it caused milia but after trying it again months later, no milia! Must have been caused by something else. This eye cream is super moisturizing and helps with fine lines that I get due to dehydration around my eyes.\\r\\nI generally don\\'t use eye creams but received this in a subscription box and now I am hooked. My undereyes are less dark and less puffy in the mornings.\\r\\nI\\'m not super into eye creams; I\\'d rather use a great face moisturizer and serum. But then I tried belif\\'s moisturizing eye bomb and I\\'m obsessed! The texture and smell are divine, and it seems to have real staying power overnight compared to other eye creams I\\'ve used. I wouldn\\'t normally spend that much money on an eye product, but I\\'m considering splurging on this again soon.\\r\\ni love this eye bomb. not exactly sure if it removes the appearance of under eyes, but definitely makes my under eyes moisturized which is what the products main purpose serves.\\r\\nGreat smell, and liked the texture however it left my undereyes dry. I was disappointed, as this product was harsh. Leaves a flakey texture on my face. I think the price point is good. But there is room for improvement!\\r\\nVery creamy and light. Putting it on your face is cool and feels refreshing; in the morning especially it helps to wake me up a bit, and reduces any puffiness in my eyes from very obvious to not noticeable.  It lasts a long time as well - it spreads easily so you don\\'t need to apply a lot to cover both eyes. Using makeup on top of it hasn\\'t been an issue. I use it in the AM and sometimes PM, but that may be unnecessary considering how elastic and smooth my eyes feel up to a day or so after applying it.\\r\\nI love this eye cream! I use everyday because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too greasy. It sinks in really well and restore moisture to the skin around your eyes. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a harsh fragrance so it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sting my eyes. I would definitely purchase this again! Well worth cost!!!\\r\\nThis is your very basic eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing out of this world but gets the job done. It did seem to decrease puffiness but not drastically. The packaging is very simple and I love it! Perhaps if it were more moisturizing with antiwrinkle properties this would be better.\\r\\nI really like this eye cream super hydrating and lightweight goes well under my make up will repurchase this product\\r\\nOne of my favorite skincare brands. I love the products because it does what it claims. Hydrating and moisturizing. Their products are worth every cent.\\r\\nTHE BEST EYE CREAM!!! I love how moisturizing this is under the eyes. You only need a small amount of product so it lasts for months! I always had dry under eyes but this product has eliminated it! Don\\'t let the higher price point detur you! Its the best!\\r\\nLove this product and have repurchased multiple times now. Its moisturizing without being too heavy so I can wear makeup over top. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my eyes at all. Some other eye products can cause a burning sensation.\\r\\nI loved the Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. The product smelled great and the packaging was nice. I would definitely use it again. Since I received a sample I would love to see the size of the product sold in stores. It went on smooth and left my skin feeling refreshed.\\r\\nThis product is great. I received it complimentary for testing purposes and really enjoyed using it. It\\'s super smooth and gel-like and really imparts long lasting moisture. Plus it has a really nice, subtle, spa-like scent. Only con is it\\'s a little pricey for a pretty basic moisturizer.\\r\\nThis product works great! It offers lots of hydration to my under eyes. A little goes a long way, so I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel like I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using all my product every time I use a little. The smell is great as well. Well worth the purchase.\\r\\nThis product is very good and I use everyday at night. It did meet my expectations and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very excited about it\\r\\nI got a sample of this. The product is a gel like texture. It soaks I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m pretty well and feels moisturizing. I wish it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come in a jar packaging. Too early to see results.\\r\\nCreamy, thick, and goes a long way. Has no scent so it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t overwhelming. A little greasy. Very moisturizing.\\r\\nI spent way too much time in the pool and sun this past summer, which made the skin around my eyes dry and tender. I first received this as a sample from Sephora and immediately fell in love after my first use. This eye bomb does everything it says. My sensitive skin felt improvement after just 2 uses. I was hooked and bought the full size. One of the best moisturizing eye creams I\\'ve ever used.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI really love how moisturizing this eye cream, however that is ALL that it does - which is fine for some but I\\'m looking for an eye cream to moisturize AND reduce fine lines, etc. Also, the price is a little steep in my opinion for an eye cream that is only a moisturizer BUT if money were no object for me, I\\'d buy this regularly to use on top of my regular multi-tasking eye cream.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis stuff works wonders. I have tryed so many other products and nothing seems to hydrate as much as this guy does. It is a bit pricy but you get a ton of product which last a very great while. You only need a bit and your good to go\\r\\nThis is absolutely one of my favorite eye creams of all time. First of all, belif is one of my holy grail brands because they have incredibly moisturizing products that really quench the skin. The skin around my eyes is quite dry and this eye cream moisturizes the area so thoroughly. The product is gel-like instead of too creamy, which is perfect for me as creaminess in eye products tend to break me out. It smells incredible and it really seeps into the skin. I wake up with hydrated eyes. It also kind of feels refreshing to apply. I love the packaging and I don\\'t think I\\'ll buy another eye cream for a while!\\r\\nGreat texture, highly moisturising eye cream. I apply this often to the eye area during the Fall and Winter. The entire line of hydrating products at Belif are fantastic! Gentle on skin and does a great job. I would purchase again.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI love the smell of this! But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wayyyy to thick to be a successful eye cream. I like it a lot for eczema/sebderm break outs. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely better for night use. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really rich, but sinks in quickly.\\r\\nWow. This is hands down the best eye cream I have ever used. It is super moisturizing and always succeeds in making my eyes look brighter. Way exceeded my expectations!t\\r\\nI love this eye cream. I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an eye cream person before receiving a sample of this, but I quickly became hooked and now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m halfway through my first jar.  This has similar qualities to other belif products that I love: it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s silky and gel-like upon application and it has a plumping and deeply moisturizing effect on the skin that lasts.   This makes me feel fresh and awake after I apply it. My makeup goes on much smoother after I use it!   This is also a great value; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m halfway through this jar and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it daily for about six months!\\r\\nThis definitely lives up to its expectations when it comes to moisturizing your under-eyes! However can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that it does much in way of helping elasticity. Consistency is like that of a water-gel, and feels very cooling on the under-eyes. A great option if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re only looking for moisture!\\r\\nThis is a great light weight eye creme. It almost has a gel like texture and absorbs very well. It has the classic belif scent. It\\'s great for use in the morning or at night and can be used under makeup. It provides a great moisturized feeling on the eye area.\\r\\nMe  encant\\xc3\\xb3 este producto para mis ojos..me humectada mucho el \\xc3\\xa1rea de los ojos y se siente super fresco..\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x80\\r\\nLove this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating and absorbs nicely into the skin. Makeup sits on top nicely. Took a star off because I feel like for the price there are other options out there that are just as good.\\r\\nThis is the best eye cream i have tried! It is really hydrating & leaves under eyes looking fresh!\\r\\nEs muy buena y ayuda a regenarar el \\xc3\\xa1rea de los ojo se siente muy bien y no es para nada pesada super ligera y f\\xc3\\xa1cil de aplicar\\r\\nI have very tired, dry, dull, and dark under eyes. Needless to say I have tried a lot of under eye creams. And I have found the one. No eye cream has ever moisturized my under eye and eye lid. I honestly feel like my eyes looked brighter and fuller.   It has a gel like consistency. I tend to prefer products that feel \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccold\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when applied to the eye. The cooling effect helps depuff. I think the gel is particularly beneficial to the eye area because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydrating without feeling too heavy.   Have and will continue to repurchase. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nSuch a great Formula for day time. Use this every morning before I do my makeup and it is just the perfect base for my concealer. It is just hydrating enough but not heavy when you concealer just slips and slides like if I use a heavier eye cream such as the shiseido benefiance one\\r\\nI got this as a sample in my play by Sephora box. I finally started using it and I wish I had sooner! It is so hydrating. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily need the extra moisture, but it definitely makes around my eyes smooth and less wrinkly/ puffy.\\r\\nvery very good undereye moisturizer.. i wouldn\\'t say it does a great job at covering or lessening the appearance of bags but really does moisturize under the eye SO well.. i love the watery like consistency and think this product is so hydrating\\r\\nOne of my favorite things is under the eye cream and this is amazing \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d say bye bye to puffy eyes\\r\\nI got a sample of this and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like it, it was heavily perfume which I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like for skincare. It also gave me milia (those tiny white bumps under the eyes), to be fair I have very sensitive under eyes and this happens to me fairly often with eye creams, but for anyone with similar skin, I would stay away from this product ! :(\\r\\nI received this in my Ipsy bag and had a horrendous reaction. Small bumps like hives formed all around my orbital bone and they HURT. It took 3-5 days for them to go away, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wear any make up or they would be further irritated. I used Tarte Eye Cream before and never had a reaction like this. I would not recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.\\r\\nReceived this in a a trial size with my aqua bomb and fell in love. Soaks into the skin and doesnt leave the eyes feeling greasy. Works like magic overnight and helps eye makeup apply with ease. Will definitley be buying the full size!\\r\\nNotice a small difference in color of my under eye but definitely notice a difference in moisture. Will last forever and easy to apply.\\r\\nI first got this as with my Sephora VIB points. I fell in love and have repurchased at least 3 times since. I love all the belief products but especially this one. During the harsh winter months when my skin is extra dry I actually use the eye cram all over my face and I wake up glowing! DEFINITELY recommend!\\r\\nI love all of the belif moisturizing creams but this one is my favorite. I apply it twice a day under my eye and it makes it feel and look so refreshed. Its very gentle on my skin which I love! Also has helped with dark circles. I would def buy again!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis stuff is heaven for the under-eye area. I have dark circles and under-eyes that tend towards being dry (especially after all the concealer it takes to cover dark circles). This cream will instantly get rid of puffiness and feels cool and deeply hydrating upon application. You know you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing the delicate skin there good with some aqua bomb love and it can revive the most tired, crepey looking under eye.\\r\\nGot this as a sample from Sephora and it lasted me so long! Excited to buy the full size since the sample lasted forever. Loved the formula and the way it felt on my skin. Honestly did not notice any changes in my dark circles but I guess not sleeping will do that to ya!\\r\\nThis is my go to eye cream when my eye area feels tired and dry.  Light moisture that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to clog my pores or leave me feeling sticky\\r\\nIts hydrating but I didn\\'t see any thing else when I used it. I was hoping for a little bit more results and it just failed me that department\\r\\nI absolutely love this eye cream for my dry and scaley under eyes. I am going and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know I needed eye cream until I started using it. It is so hydrating and a great value since you use so little! I highly recommend it!\\r\\nLightweight and amazing! Kind of pricey but feels amazing when its on the skin. Good value for the quality\\r\\nGreat to use during the day! Lightweight hydration that doesn\\'t mess with any makeup that I put on top of it.\\r\\nReally love how little you need of this. As well as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so light on the skin and fast absorbing. T also makes my skin feel so smooth and great prep for makeup. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little pricey and haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bought the full size product yet but always get this in my subscription boxes.\\r\\nSo moisturizing! Feels so cooling and hydrating  under my eyes. It is very refreshing. Absorbs quickly and goes well under makeup! Would recommend.\\r\\nMy mother feels like her eyes are much healthier looking since she started using this product.\\r\\nBuen\\xc3\\xadsima. Me encanto. No he dejado de usarla desde que la obtuve. Siempre he tenido la piel reseca debajo de los ojos y esto me ha ayudado much\\xc3\\xadsimo. La aplico todas las ma\\xc3\\xb1anas en mi rutina matutina\\r\\nVery Nice Eye Bomb! I have never really used eye creams before, but this one is super hydrating, lays great under makeup, and makes my eyes feel refreshed. I love wearing it at night but it also works great during the day. I have 4 stars because of the high price tag... ouch\\r\\nAmazing silkiness and intense moisture for night time! A little product goes a long way under the eyes! It instantly makes my eyes look less tired\\r\\nEsta crema de ojos al igual que la crema hidratante son una bomba para tus ojos porque te los desinflama te alivies arrojes y te quita un poquito las ojeras y para esa parte delicada de tus ojos esto es una maravilla\\r\\nSuper hydrating and smooth. This product not only hydrates under the eyes, but also helps makeup glide on smoothly and not cake up. Highly recommend for a very hydrating but light eye cream.\\r\\nThis is my favorite eye cream I have been using it for about 10 months now. I got it because my eyes tend to get dry in the creases and I was worried about crows feet. I will usually use it at night, but if my skin is feeling particularly dry I will use it before make-up and it works really great.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI received this from Influenster in exchange for my review. This is a great, thick, moisturizing, eye cream. Has a light, refreshing scent, that goes away after you rub it in. You get a generous amount and one jar will last you a good amount of time. Smooth and easy to you and I feel that my eyes look moisturized and refreshed. I like to apply on no makeup days and at night time before bed. Can be found at Sephora.\\r\\nI love this product!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating and has a gel-like formula that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fast absorbing and keeps my eyes hydrated all day long. It keeps my skin glowing and I notice a difference in fine lines, dryness, and puffiness. I will definitely be buying this product again!\\r\\nMy@favorite eye mask so far. Truly stays on for me and provides lasting moisture and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dry up too fast. My eyes look incredible after using this consistently for a month!\\r\\nI like how lightweight and moisturizing this cream is. A little goes a long way and it leaves your eye feeling moisturized all day. I have only had the mini size and it lasted me a while. I would recommend it.\\r\\nIt was very hydrating and lightweight, but I needed something heavier in consistency to help with my fine lines.\\r\\nI got this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. It didn\\'t wow me, it is really smooth and light. Wouldn\\'t buy it again.\\r\\nLove love loved this cream!! It felt fresh and cool it helped my sleepy bags disappear! Was very smooth!\\r\\nThis is very moisturizing and feels great not greasy or sticky like some other eye creams I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried.\\r\\nI use Belif Moisturizing eye bomb every day. I absolutely love this stuff and it works awesome. I would recommend this product to everyone. I love this stuff!!!!\\r\\nI think Belief  makes some amazing products. This is not one of them. This is very fragranced for an eye cream. My skin tends to run on the dry side and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel like this is super hydrating. I probably think that the fragrance is why it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not hydrating the fragrance probably has alcohol in it. Alcohol is actually listed in the ingredients. Being that the skin under the eye is actually thinner and more delicate than the skin on the rest the face I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth the risk putting alcohol there.\\r\\nThis isa \\xc2\\xa0great eye moisturizer. My under-eye is very dry and I have been using this once a day in the morning. My eyes are nice a moisturized and it helps my concealer go on very smoothly and not look too crepe-y. I would recommend it and will probably repurchase.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI bought this based on reviews, and it did not disappoint!! My skin is typically pretty dry, the eye bomb was very moisturizing. Plus, it does a very good job of boosting the elasticity around my eyes causing my skin to look soft and smooth!\\r\\nI cannot express how much I LOVE this this fue bomb !!!! I use this EVERYDAY and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m through my second bottle now \\xf0\\x9f\\xa4\\xa6\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xbb\\xe2\\x80\\x8d\\xe2\\x99\\x80\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d i used it in my on of my YouTube videos !  make sure you go watch \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x89 YouTube link on my profile !\\r\\nThis is some really good stuff.

I like how it applies and works. I love the container. I would certainly recommend it\\r\\nI got a deluxe sample size of this eye cream from Sephora and loved it. It keeps my under eye moisturized and helps with my fine lines. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good value and I plan on buying the full size when I finish the deluxe size. I put it on in the evening and sleep with it on. In the morning my eyes look less puffy and my fines lines are getting smaller.\\r\\nHello,i love this product , i love all the products of this company if you allow me to review this product i would be grateful to you, with my love and appreciation.......It\\'s really a really impressive product and I recommend buying it!!!!!!!\\r\\nI love this stuff. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m one of those people that never really sees a difference from eye creams, but this one is great. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more like a gel, and what I like most about it is that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t travel into your eyes like I find most eye creams do. It absorbs quickly, moisturizes well, and looks great under makeup.\\r\\nI\\'ve been using this twice a day for about 3 weeks or so and I\\'ve definitely notice that the little fine lines next to my eyes are diminished. I think the biggest factor in that is that the Moisturizing eye bomb is the perfect combination of moisturizing (of course) with a nice texture and enough substance to stick around all day or night.\\xc2\\xa0I love the packaging and the size is very generous. I\\'m used to eye creams in little jars, but this one is a much more generous size and I\\'ve barely made a dent in it.\\xc2\\xa0It is a gel cream texture, not oily, and it absorbs well, but also protects the eye area so your skin doesn\\'t just suck it up and leave the area dry again. It really does last for at least 10 hours or so I\\'d say, probably lo\\r\\nPerfect eye-cream! It gives you the pump and moisture that your eyes areas need but without getting oily and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s AMAZING. I always apply it before my foundation routine so I protect my skin and prevent dryness.\\r\\nIt is such a good eye cream. Got a sample and loved it so much that i bought a full size. Definitely hydrates and for me it also decreased puffiness.\\r\\nOne of my favorite eye creams. I use the eye bomb every morning. It applies so smoothly and helps with keeping my concealer looking smooth too. Highly, hlighy recommend\\r\\nExcellent moisture and very hydrating for under eyes. Does nothing to dark circles or improvement of skin over time, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great price point for daily hydration and wears well under makeup.\\r\\nI first got this in one of my beauty subscription boxes and after trying it out, its now part of my nightly skin care regimen!! Just a tiny bit of this tapped under my eyes is all it takes for hydrated & smooth looking skin! This makes my foundation and concealor easily glide on, without looking dry, patchy or cakey!! I really notice the difference this eye cream makes to my under eyes, Im really loving it!!\\r\\nVery moisturizing but not too thick. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely worth the money too!! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used Este Lauder eye creams and they just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do the same as this! And they are almost twice as expensive.\\r\\nThis is a nice cooking eye cream. It definitely moisturizes and de-puffs my under eye area. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed a huge difference in fine lines, but it sits nicely under makeup and does the job of moisturizing.\\r\\nLove this to keep my eyes hydrated. I use this at night with my Sunday Riley Luna oil. Wake up to refreshed eyes every morning\\r\\nSuch an amazing eye cream.\\xc2\\xa0 Super super super hydrating - good for young ppl who need an affordable and effective eye cream and also good for older ppl worried about wrinkles and fine lines since it\\'s so hydrating!\\xc2\\xa0 Smells amazing and feels so good when applied.\\xc2\\xa0 I\\'ve been using mine since January (9 months) twice a day and there\\'s still soo much product left! You barely need any!\\r\\nI love belif products, and this one is no different. It met ever expectation i had for it and the brand, it moisturized my dry under eyes helped give them some supleness so less tiny lines. I like to put mine in the fridge because it helps depuff my eyes in the morning before i do my makeup. It absorbs well, no tackiness or greasy feeling felt behind. I just wish the jars on belif products weren\\'t deceiving lol i know it goes by oz but it still a let down onky the middle on the container is filled.\\r\\nI love this eye-cream it really does moisturize your eye. I think it does not get rid of my puffy eyes and this product is over priced as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried other eye creams that feel much more refreshed for a cheaper price.\\r\\nThis stuff is the real deal. It esp saved me in the winter time because i have very dry skin under my eyes when the weather is cold. Very soothing and gentle. Give this a try it works\\r\\nThis eye cream is so lightweight and hydrating! I typically use this during the day under concealer for its gel consistency and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in love\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye BombLove this product! Received as part of a Sephora Play! Box. Great packaging, good color and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t waste a lot of the product. Product applies easily and isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too greasy - I typically applied at night and slept with it on. Did provide great moisture through the whole day and seemed to give some lift to the skin. Smells good but not overwhelmingly so. Would definitely buy again.\\r\\nDreamy, whipped eye cream that I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get enough of! It is very gentle, and fluffy yet thick yet lightweight (does that make sense?). Hydrated my dry, sensitive eye area SO well! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve purchase two jars so far. 1 jar lasts me about 3 months if using night and day. Also works well under makeup, though I typically do not wear much under my eyes. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis is a great eye moisturizer. It is gel like and cooling. My eyes feel moisturized immediately after applying, but continue to feel hydrated. Appears to be more plump in he under-eye area. Not greasy or heavy. My eyes are sensitive and this doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cause irritation. No harsh smells.\\r\\nOMG I swear by this product! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so so good! You might think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bit pricey but this will last you a long time. My under eyes feel well hydrated.\\r\\nI love this. It is highly moisturizing. It is great for under my concealer. It keeps my concealer from looking dry and Carey.\\r\\nCurrently using this in a sample size. Love it!!! I have the aqua bomb and it helps so much with not making my face look oily!!! Great for a morning moisturizer!!\\r\\nAmazing eye cream!! So hydrating without feeling like you even put on anything. Super lightweight. It last forever too. Definitely recommend!\\r\\nThis moisturizes great and doesn\\'t sting or burn your eyes.  I have tried another brand that I couldn\\'t stand.\\r\\nLove this product! Easy application and great results! I got this as a sample and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll definitely be getting a full size.\\r\\nI love this line of products! I have acne prone skin and this is so moisturizing without being too thick! The eye bomb is great! I can tell a difference in my makeup application and it has been about 3 weeks of using the product!\\r\\nThe eye bomb does exactly what it promises! It\\'s highly moisturizing. If you are only looking for a moisturizing eye cream, this is for you. It\\'s the only eye cream that I have right now. If you\\'re looking for dark circle and puffiness relief, this is not for you but Belif doesn\\'t make those promises. I put this on last before I do my makeup and it goes on well over it. Soaks in nicely and hours later, is still hydrated. Highly recommend!\\r\\nFeels good going on but I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really seen that it makes a big difference in the under eye area.   It adds moisture but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about it.  Little expensive but it has lasted me quite some time since you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need much.\\r\\nThe Eye Bomb is a little creamier and can definitely also be used by people with dry skin b/c of its thicker consistency. It is pricey but a little bit of this product goes a long way. I highly\\xc2\\xa0recommend this eye cream. It is truly a really good quality product.\\r\\nHands down my all time favorite under eye moisturizer I use this every single day morning and night I recommend every one to get this product I love it\\r\\nLove this product. I just started using last week and already have seen a difference in the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s creamy, non-sticky and has a great smell.\\r\\nI absolutely love this eye cream. Is does a great job at keeping your under eye moisturized. It is a great nighttime cream because it is a little think. The price is very reasonable. I would definitely use again!\\r\\nAll I have to say is WOAH! I used a few products on my face and ended up with a dry patch! This dry patch was so visible and patchy I thought it would take forever to go away. On the second day I went into Sephora in the morning to put some of this eye cream on around my eyes and on my dry patch ( the dry patch was close to my eye) and when I tell you by the end of the day it was already half way healed! When I got home, I did my facial routine with more of the eye cream and the BELIF Aqua Bomb Sleeping Mask 2.53 fl oz (Jelly pudding sleeping mask) and the results were insane. My dry patch literally healed overnight! Idk what insane unicorn ingredients they have in this but this eye bomb is no joke! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried in my life! It makes the others look mediocre! The consistency is also thin and absorbs nicely so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfection day and night! This eye cream is a dream!\\r\\nI got a deluxe sample of this in my order a few months ago. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this every night and it really does what it claims. You only need a tiny bit under both eyes and it keeps the under eye area so hydrated!! Highly recommend!\\r\\nHydrating without feeling greasy. Use the smallest bit and gently pat in. Never had any irritation.\\r\\nI love all of the belif products that I have tried. They all tend to be lightweight but also extremely moisturizing. They are perfect for me because I have very oily skin. A little goes a long away also which is good for the wallet.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just like the belif aqua bomb but better! I received a mini size in the Aqua Playland Set at Sephora. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking into getting this, try the set at the Sephora. You get the full size aqua bomb, and minis of the eye bomb and Hungarian water essence \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for the same price as the aqua bomb! Such a good deal. The product itself is great. The best moisturizer for under eye. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only used it at night before bed. 10/10 recommend!\\r\\none of my favorite eye creams ever. it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not sticky and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a smell and i love that. i got this through influenster initially but i will only buy this eye cream now. my eyes are more hydrated than ever thanks to belif\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so perfect! SERIOUSLY! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like not too creamy, I hate when eye creams are too oily! It feels like it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get into my eye to produce an effect! I feel like my eyes are refreshed! I feel like they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re less draggy! And my eye lids hold my make up so much longer! I totally love belif and EVERYTGING THEY STAND FOR!\\r\\nI recently received this item in a subscription service and was absolutely delighted to find this product sink into the skin and quickly do its job. I find that it is so moisturizing and helps to eliminate any dryness that irritates me.\\r\\nDecent price for the amount of product you get, and it does a good job of hydrating the under eye area, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about it.\\r\\nI love how this applies underneath my eyes. It feels so cooling and light weight. I noticed immediate results after one application. Plus, you get a huge amount, worth the price!\\r\\nI love this brand and product! Its light and non greasy. Absorbs quickly. My under eye has been looking more plump since using it\\r\\nThis is an amazing eye cream. It hydrates my under eyes and brightens and minimizes the appearance of dark circles. It is a nice gel-like consistency and doesn\\'t cause my concealer to crease like some other eye creams. I would totally buy this again and again.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nBy far my favorite eye bomb at this moment. \\xc2\\xa0I wear it every night. \\xc2\\xa0It is so light weight, a little goes a long way. \\xc2\\xa0I have oily and dry skin (combination skin) and it works perfectly. \\xc2\\xa0The bomb has more of a gel consistency which is nice for oily and combination skin gals and guys. I works bomb under the eye (get it bomb). It leaves your under eye feeling soft, refreshing and clean and it also has help how my make up looks under my eye \\xc2\\xa0much much better. \\xc2\\xa0The packaging is basic but effective. \\xc2\\xa0The price is a little to much for my personal liking but considering how a little goes a long way and the results you get it totally think it is worth it. \\xc2\\xa0I will last you a long time. \\xc2\\xa0A must try my oily and combination people.\\r\\nI bought this eye cream because it had great reviews everywhere. It is a very moisturizing eye cream I found that that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all it did for me. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help with my fine lines or darkness. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t repurchase.\\r\\nLightweight, soft, instantly absorbed, and a wave of much needed hydration. It perfectly plumped my dry undereye skin. Ideal for under makeup. A little goes a long way, so that satisfies my frugality.\\r\\nI absolutely love this brand. This eye cream felt so refreshing and cooling under my eyes. I also like the moisturizer from this brand and I feel they work very well together. Like most skin care is, this brand is high end but it works very well although it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on the pricier side.\\r\\nMy eyelids and undereye get dry and flaky during the winter months and this was excellent to combat that dryness! It is very moisturizing without being heavy or overly oily. I really enjoyed using this and would repurchase this upcoming winter!\\r\\nAs far as eye creams go - it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a lot better. Especially for this price point. I did notice that it has a tendency to get a little oily, so maybe not the best for someone who already had oily skin.\\r\\nThis eye cream is so moisturizing even on my dry under eye area. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for sensitive skin and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my eye area at all. My makeup goes on flawlessly over top of it. I would definitely recommend giving this a try!\\r\\nThis eye cream is amazing. It really moisturizes the eye area without leaving it feeling greasy. It absorbs into the skin but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make the area feel tight or dry again in a few hours. Makeup applies beautifully overtop.\\r\\nI tried this but I can\\'t give a full review on the product coz I am only using it for less than month and I can\\'t still see changes\\r\\nI love this brand! I have used other products by belief in the past and I love them! They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re quite expensive but 100% worth it. It was my first time with this and I would definitely buy it again for what its worth I love it\\r\\nI loved this eye bomb. I used it more than just around my eyes because I instantly felt refreshed and moistened when using it. Easy to use..the packaging is cute and minimalistic, which I love. I would\\'ve given 5 stars, but it\\'s a little out of the price range I like to spend on moisturizers.\\r\\nbelif moisturizing eye bomb is the bomb. You can really feel it how much it\\'s moisturizing your under eye. I love it. Feels nice and wears well under my make-up! Super recommended\\r\\nVery light formula that feels incredible under the eye. Very hydrating. The packaging is nice, but there is a lot of unused space in the packaging design. I would repurchase.\\r\\nHydra bomb for under your eyes! It is super moisturizing and I recommend it if you are looking for affordable eye cream.\\r\\nGot a sample of this and it is easily the best hydrating eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever tried. A little goes a long way too. I personally prefer eye products with anti-aging benefits but if I had really dry undereyes I would definitely use this.\\r\\nThis under eye moisturizer is amazing! It left my skin feeling super smooth and fresh. After a while of using it, my under eye bags began to fade. It was my first time trying this brand, but I still use it.\\r\\nI love love love this eye cream! It is the MOST hydrating eye cream I have ever tried. The jar size is pretty generous and a little goes a long way so this will last you forever! It applies ultra creamy and I find that it almost \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplumps\\xe2\\x80\\x9d my under eyes with hydration, I love it. When I wake up the next morning my concealer applies like a breeze and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cling to any dry parts. Some people have found this eye dream to be TOO hydrating and lead to milia, but that hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been the case for me! If you have dry under eyes you NEED to try this, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lifesaver!\\r\\nI love it moisturizes a lot and it leaves you shiny and soft really beautiful skin is one of the products of my routine\\r\\nI got this in my Ipsy bag & I love it! Loved it so much I went out & bought it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pricey but worth it.\\r\\nI purchase this in a kit first and I loved it. It is very moisturizing and it is very gentle around the eyes.\\r\\nI\\'ve only used this a few times but it does do a good job of moisturizing. I love the moisturizing bomb so I thought this might pair well with it. I don\\'t really have an evidence that it works on dark circles and that is one of my primary concerns so I probably won\\'t repurchase.\\r\\nThe only eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used that made visible difference. Noticeable improvement in dark under eye circles, fine lines, and puffiness, all day! Completely worth 50 bucks for 3/4 of an ounce.\\r\\nI have dry under eyes and this really moisturizer my skin. Plus, a little goes a long way. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moisturizing without being greasy and there is no scent. I bought this in a mini travel set which I would highly recommend.\\r\\nHow surprised I was by this product...  my undereye area is so dry, and I squint a lot during the day since I sit Infront of multiple screens all day, so I need some heavy duty hydration. And boy did this cream deliver! I apply in the morning, and am good all the way till the evening... no discomfort in my undereye area and no sign of dryness. I got this in a voxbox and immediately went and bought another. Just live this product , definitely one of the best eye hydration.\\r\\nNot the best eye cream for helping diminish fine lines but super moisturizing. It feels somewhat like a gel cream so applying it feels cooling and soothing to the undereyes. I dont know if I would buy it again considering the price tag though. Maybe during a sale\\r\\nThis is a nice eye cream. I like it for under makeup and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really hydrating. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed that much of a difference with my under eye other then it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more hydrated\\r\\nI like in general. This product don\\'t make my eyes feel irritated or stick, so I can use any time of the day.\\r\\nDidn\\'t really notice a difference but it had a nice texture and I don\\'t think it actually hurt anything plus it smelled clean and didn\\'t make my eyes burn.\\r\\nLove it! So moisturizing. I use it in the morning and at night over my anti-aging eye serum. Makeup and concealer layer over it so well. My eyes look 100 times better with this stuff.

I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m an eye cream junkie and this is in my top three favorites. This gives me the moisture I want without feeling too harsh. Plus, you get a lot in the container which is always nice.\\r\\nBomb.com! This eye product is a defiantly the best moisturizing product for eyes ! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used it the first time and Completly fell in love ! For the price I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth it because you only need less then a dime size! It lasts me forever ! I would get it again!\\r\\nAwesome product very moisturizing. Dried awesome and did not leave you oily. Definitely would recommend\\r\\nI found this to be one of the most hydrating eye creams I\\'ve ever used. Most of my fine lines are due to dehydration, and this definitely helped with that! Negative: the packaging isn\\'t my favorite (bulkier than it needs to be).\\r\\nAbsolute love ! Great eye cream for my sensitive skin. It absorbs quickly, moisturizes well, and has no residue. I hate eye creams that I can \\xe2\\x80\\x9croll\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. This is definitely not one of them ! Also, you need a tiny amount, so it will last you for a while.\\r\\nLet me start by saying I LOVE gel eye moisturizers! Since i have oily skin, I have found that these work best for me and dont add \"extra\" oil to my face. This eye gel felt cool on my skin and melted right in. I make sure I always apply this before bed and again in the morning and I have seen my under eyes look more plump (in a good way) and moisturized. Absolutley\\xc2\\xa0will continue to purchase this time and time again.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nHydration! The perfect product to quench your under eyes and keep them nice and hydrated.\\r\\n5 stars veryyyyy soothing and and creamy! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t beable to let this eye cream go yet!\\r\\nSuch a great lightweight eye cream! I usually wear this one during the day because it lays so well underneath my makeup. It hydrates and soothes throughout the day without melting off like heavier eye creams. Definitely recommend!\\r\\nI was never into using eye creams. I have used a few before and could not tell much of a difference so I just used normal moisturizer until I came across this. I originally bought it to use at night but I enjoy it so much I use it night and day. It makes my concealer go on so much smoother and has helped so much with my under eyes all together. Great product!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI really love this stuff wish 9 could afford some more!! It has really help with my puffy eyes..It works amazingly!\\xc2\\xa0 I have been having hearing and eye issuess.\\r\\nI got a sample of Belif eye cream in a sephora order.  I know it\\'s an eye cream,  but I used it on my full face and easily got 3 applications out of the sample pack,  so a little goes a long way.  It had a slight citrus-y scent but it\\'s not overpowering.  It leaves my face feeling soft and doesn\\'t irritate my sensitive skin.  It\\'s on par with my go-to moisturizer except that I prefer something with sun protection.\\r\\nMy under eyes definitely feels more hydrated! But as far as dark circles it doesnt really improve the look but I dont really have dark circles to begin with.\\r\\nLove love love this product!!! It makes you under eyes so hydrated, and ready for makeup. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of my holy grails\\r\\nthis eye cream is bomb, mosturizes and makes sure ur under eyes don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t crease if you plan on wearing makeup after application, great price and great value\\r\\nThis is a solid eye cream, not the best I\\'ve used but its great to have around and the design of the bottle itself is very nice. I prefer to use this during the summer/humid temperatures it doesn\\'t become runny like other under eye products so thats a definite plus.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only tried a trial size of this item but I LOVE it. My under eyes feel so refreshed and hydrated with this product. Will definitely be purchasing the full size.\\r\\nI love this stuff! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m only twenty but i figures it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s never to early to start taking care of your skin, so i use this every single night right after i finish taking my makeup and cleansing my skin and this stuff is amazing! I noticed right away the difference in my under eye area after 1 use\\r\\nIt is amazing!!!! Very moisturizing it leaves the under-eye smooth and brilliant, would recommend to anyone looking for a new rue cream\\r\\nI love belif products. This eye cream felt nice on the skin, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel like it did anything.\\r\\nIf you have dry under eyes this is perfect for you. This really adds a lot of moisture\\r\\nI enjoy using the eye bomb, I wish that it soaked into the skin a little more, it feels as if it sits on top for a while. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very gentle and great for sensitive skin.\\r\\nThis eye bomb is amazing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydrating it is more of a gel like consistency and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s light weight not heavy underneath. I like the smell it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s soothing to me personally. And idk if anyone ever experience it but it does have a cooling feel too\\r\\nI use this more as an under eye mask. When I put on my night sleeping mask (usually Water Sleeping Mask) I pu on a little extra of this. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel that it helps my under eyes look better, but it feels so hydrating and refreshing which feels amazing after having concealer on all day.\\r\\nMade my eyes look more awake! I use this every morning as part of my morning routine.\\r\\nVery light and not too thick on the skin. I love using it at night to cool and calm the eye area.\\r\\nI got this as a sample and was super excited about it because I love this brand, I regularly use their moisturizing bomb and it\\'s a hol\\r\\nThis is the best eye cream. It is super moisturizing without being heavy. The package is great as well. I have now bought this several times and I will keep buying it. I would highly recommend this product!!!\\r\\nI received the belief moisturizing eye bomb in an Ipsy bag last year and I have been hooked ever since.  It has a lightweight, gel-cream consistency that is not greasy or heavy under the eye. It does not irritate or cause my eyes to water like a lot of others I\\'ve tried. Using this daily has improved the hydration of my skin.\\r\\nThis is my current eye cream. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t finished the jar. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effective. Moisturizing without being overly so (and disruptive to my makeup). It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good.\\r\\nNothing special, soaks into the skin pretty quick since it is a gel but would not be good if your undereyes are really dry.. i have norman skin so this is just a precaution under makeup.  A little pricey for what it is but a little goes a long way.\\r\\nI love This stuff! It really hydrated my under eye area, I even sampled their regular moisturizer and it was life changing!\\r\\nThis is a good eye cream for basic moisturization of the under eye area. It doesn\\'t provide much more than that. But that is really all I was looking for. Eye cream is one of those things that I am always looking for something better.\\r\\nThe most perfect moisturizing eye bomb! I use it most nights (that I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget), and on days I feel that my under eyes or lids are feeling dry, I apply this before my makeup and it helps immediately!\\r\\nThis product is very hydrating and light. It does not leave your skin feeling greasy, and it brightens your complexion.\\r\\nI absolutely love how hydrating this cream is and how nice it smells. I always hated creams that feel dry under my eyes but this one is perfect!\\r\\nI use this underneath makeup as a 360 eye cream. I use a small pea-sized amount and dab it on my under eyes up to my brow bone and onto my eyelids. It wakes me up in the morning and where is beautiful you under my makeup all day without creasing and caking or cracking.\\r\\nMy favorite eye cream as of date. It provides instant moisture, helps combat dark circles and brightens. 5/5.\\r\\nKeeps my eyes really moisturized :) my sister likes it too and she stole it from me haha but will be buying again!\\r\\nGreat for dry skin and for getting rid of pesky under eye bags. I have used this for about a week now and I have already noticed a difference in the smoothness around my eyes when I wake up, rather than puffy bags from sleeping. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to invest in a mildly\\xc2\\xa0priced eye cream. This is an essential part of any skin care routine.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nMy go-to, everyday eye cream. It leaves your eye contour soft and smooth, but never greasy. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried others but always come back to this. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never had issue with makeup pilling over this like I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had with some others either. You can find deluxe samples of it in the summer and winter play land kits from Sephora. They will be packaged with either the Aqua bomb or moisturizing Bomb depending on the season, along with a Hungarian Water essence (all for the price of the moisturizer!)\\r\\nBest eye cream I have ever used, I put in on my dry spots all over my face and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so moisturizing\\r\\nI love this moisturizing eye cream  This cream provide up to 26 hours moisture and improve elasticity\\r\\nI got this initially as a sample in a subscription box and have fallen in LOVE! It is pretty expensive but you only need a small amount so it lasts a very long time. I had my sample (pretty small jar) for probably 2 months 1-2x/day, every day. LOVE!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used this months with no change in dark circles, puffiness or wrinkles not sure if it even made to do that but I need a eye cream that does so this doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much for me except provide moisture under eye..use this under my retinol eye cream and love that my eyes stay hydrated also good under makeup for dry eye folks\\r\\nI love Belif, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see the benefit of using this over the regular moisturizer under the eye. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty much the same product, just a more expensive. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis is a decent eye cream. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if I would buy it again though because I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice any improvement and it feels like vasaline on my face. Good ingredients though which is important to me.\\r\\nI love love love this! I have used belif moisturizers for a few years and I am obsessed with all of them! I actually got this one from Influenster VoxBox & fell in love! It is expensive, but a little goes a long ways so it will last a long time! Lightweight, non-greasy & keeps delicate under eye skin feeling soft and supple!\\r\\nI was never a fan of eye creams until I was recommended this eye cream at Sephora. I skipped eye cream because I didn\\'t see the benefits, and all eye creams I tried gave me little bumps under my eyes this eye cream is different because it\\'s not a cream. It\\'s a gel like consistency that feels a lot lighter than other eye creams and is easily absorbed. It has helps moisturize my under eye dry patches without it every clogging pores or giving me bumps.\\r\\nI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have wrinkles to correct BUT I definitely was seeing a decrease in moisture in the skin around my eyes. This is ultra hydrating, not too heavy and perfect for sensitive skin that can be easily aggitated. Loving this at night\\xe2\\x80\\x94 but possibly a little too thick for daily use under makeup\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis eye cream is THE BOMB. Literally. Hands down my favorite. Its lightweight but it helps with circles, puffiness, and helps to blur those pesky fine lines under the eye. Its the perfect base for your concealer as well!! 5 stars \\xe2\\x9c\\xa8\\r\\nAMAZING!! Your eyes feel so hydrated after applying this product. I use this morning and night and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to use anything else for the time being. I have problems with dryness under the eye which makes my makeup apply funny and this solves the problem! In love with this products and my eyes are too!\\r\\nI received a sample jar of this from a friend who did not want this. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it daily for about 2 weeks. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve not noticed any changes around and under my eyes yet but hopeful. I feel like the cream is not oily and does not leave any residue. I feel like a little goes a long way. I like using it and will probably start purchasing this eye cream.\\r\\nWasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure if eye creams were truly worth it until I used this one! It truly hydrates and makes the skin around my eyes feel and look so healthy. Love this and it has become a staple in my routine\\r\\nReally awesome eye cream. Smells expensive and I love it. Does a great job hydrating my under eyes.\\r\\nI like this, but can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say I would pay $50 for it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve enjoyed my complimentary product, but can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say this leaves \\xe2\\x80\\x9c24 hours moisturized\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell a difference. But I do like the smell, consistency, and packaging.\\r\\nThis is a great moisturizing eye cream! It always leaves my under eyes perfectly hydrated and sits well under makeup. You also get a ton of product for the price. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using since January and still have over half left!\\r\\nI love how this stuff feels on my eyes. It decreased puffiness and has a cooling effect on the eyes. A little but goes a long way\\r\\nI apply this everyday before doing my makeup and it works wonders!!! This has become an everyday product for my routine!!\\r\\nBelief Moisturizing Eye Bomb is the bomb!  I just ordered my second jar in 3 months.  I use it morning and night and have noticed dramatic results.  My lines are much less noticeable.  It acts as a great base in the morning to prevent creasing in my make-up.\\r\\nThis product went beyond my expectations. The formula is so lightweight. It deeply hydrates my undereyes.\\r\\nwow ! this ia amazingly waw i love the reasults the smell and all about it  i am uaing this product really it moatiruzes my eye amd vive it a perfecrt glowwwwwww i have a dry unnder eyes area reallt it works amazing wz me\\r\\nnothing is more moisturizing than belief water bomb creams. This one is super hydrating for the eye area and smells nice too!\\r\\nI absolutely love this stuff! This jar will last forever because you only need a little bit. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very moisturizing without being greasy.\\r\\nThis stuff is great. Smells like candy, like all of their products, is gentle, and does a great job plumping my under eye. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a pricier product, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the best eye creams I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried, so I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth it.\\r\\nThis is by far my favorite eye cream! I hate using most moisturizers on my face but this beats every other one I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried! So effective!\\r\\nThis is the only eye moisturizer that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my eyes AND sufficiently moisturizes them at the same time. Most eye creams make my eyes burn and water but this one doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. It could be a little bit more moisturizing but overall I love it. I apply it on my entire eye area\\xe2\\x80\\x94on the undereye area and also my eyelids and have no problems. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve even gotten it IN my eye and had no discomfort or irritation from that. I mix it with a mushroom serum sometimes for added moisture. I think it helps keep away the finelines and wrinkles, I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen any new ones since I began using it. It also has a calming, natural smell (like verbena maybe) that dissipates quickly.\\r\\nThis is a lightweight gel that plumps up the undereye area. It sinks in quickly and feels cooling. It isn\\'t anything special, though. I didn\\'t see any significant change compared to the cream I used before this one.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nBest eye cream ever hands down. Noticable difference in fine lines. Does not make makeup slip or crease at all. 100% recommend.\\r\\nI usually apply this before I do my makeup and before bed. It does the perfect job of moisturizing my under eye. I also apply it to any dry spots I have on any part of my face and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed them disappearing. I would most definitely recommend\\r\\nMoisturizing and not super greasy but I am not super wowed by it. I will probably try another eye cream once I run out of this.\\r\\nI LOVE THIS. I honestly think this might be one of the most hydrating products I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever found for undereyes. I genuinely have trouble with dryness under eyes and this has honestly really helped. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried to find something wrong with it but honestly haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been able to. I lost my first jar after reorganizing my place and was honestly devastated. It was half empty after two months, but admittedly I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a bit obsessive over eye cream and I use more than normal people do. Anyway, just ordered a second bottle. Neeeeeeeed!\\r\\nThis eye cream is AMAZING!! I use it as a night eye cream cause it\\'s very moisturizing!! I wake up with bright eyes every morning...I\\'m almost out of my current one and need to repurchase another! But it does last a very long time!!\\r\\nI have not been using this for a while but I have noticed that my one undereye wrinkle is less prominent and my eye area seems more moisturized. This is a great product if you want to moisturize your eye area and prevent eye wrinkles from forming. Belif is a great brand if you want a lot of hydration which every skin type loves. This is a little pricey but it\\'s worth every penny and you get a good amount of product since you don\\'t need that much moisturizer for the eye area. The texture is like a cream and gel consistency and melts into the skin easily. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a little hydration in their eye area.\\r\\nA great every day eye cream, makes eye skin feel instantly moisturized and makes it easier for eyeshadows to stick.\\r\\nI am so happy with this product! I am forever struggling with under eye issues. Either nothing works or it does not absorb into the skin very well! This did both! I notice smoother skin and less puff eyes than before! Also its gel based so it dries very quick!\\r\\nMy go to everyday eye cream. So hydrating!! Helps with my under eye puffiness and layers well with my other skin care products. I also use it on my elevens, and find it helps to tone down the fine lines there. Will absolutely repurchase!\\r\\nI love this eye moisturizing cream! It lasts for so long. I started getting really dry skin by my eyelids and I put some of this cream on that area and it worked great! It kept my skin moisturized. I love that it works on sensitive skin. I would definitely recommend this product!\\r\\nI love this product! It has a nice spa-like scent to it. It has certainly met my expectations. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gentle, applies so smoothly, and is effective. I would certainly buy again, and I would also recommend! I should also add, this is a very lightweight, but hydrating formula!\\r\\nThis eye cream is OK. I really liked it at first. It feels great to apply. However this eye cream piles up like no other! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used every face cream I have with this stuff and it never absorbs. It just piles up into a bunch of little balls and rubs away. I wanted to love it!\\r\\nHelps with softening fine lines and wrinkles! You definitely wake up with fresher eyes, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very effective product!\\r\\nThis product did not provide any significant hydration to my eye area.  I still had bags and no improvement to my fine lines.\\r\\nI give it 5 stars as a face primer not so much as an eye cream. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a difference with my under eyes but as a face primer it worked well. Kept my face hydrated and my make up on longer.\\r\\nMe encanta. No cre\\xc3\\xada que una crema para hidrata ser\\xc3\\xada capaz de reducir ojeras. La verdad es que si, lo hace!! Estoy muy feliz porque a pesar de que tengo ojeras por herencia, se han disminuido bastante.\\r\\nThis is so damn moisturizing duhhh hence the name but wowwww i was so impressed . The tiniest bit of this is all you need to dab on and your under eye makeup will be applied much better ! I loved it the first time i used it .\\r\\nOver the course of the month I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had to try this (received a sample in my Sephora play) it has visibly increased the elasticity and moisture of my under eye area.  It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so much for bags but the lines and dryness are visibly reduced.  So much so that I bought the full size!\\r\\nI really like using this under my eyes. I received a sample size and quickly upgraded to a larger size. This lead me to find belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb. Using them together with the belif Hungarian Water Essence underneath every night keeps my skin happy and hydrated all day.\\r\\nIt was ok and I have to be honest I didn\\'t see much of a difference. I would not go out of my way to buy this at a store I don\\'t think it\\'s worth the money. Not different from much cheaper moisturizers.\\r\\nThis is the best moisturizing eye cream ever! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m only missing it being de puffing. But i love when my eyes are feeling super dry and i can throw this on and instantly feel better. Amazing for under concealer! And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very big worth the price.\\r\\nI love this eye cream! Absorbs well, deeply hydrating, and my entire area is much smoother & more hydrated! I\\'m fast approaching thirty, and this was a great first eye cream to incorporate into my routine to start caring for my eye area! *Highly* recommend!\\r\\nThis seemed to work well, no smell seemed to be very moisturizing . Con for me it\\'s small for the price this should have been at least the same size jar as the moisturizer. I haven\\'t decided if I would buy again\\r\\nI am turning 32 and was looking as a crazy another moisturizing cream for muy under eyes, because I was using a product of L\\'ebel and was not enough, until I round this EYE BOMB. Simple, I love it.\\r\\nI haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed a distinct difference with this eye cream, but it feels so refreshing under the eye.\\r\\nI have this product it leaves my under eyes moisturized. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effective. And I recommend it and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good value.\\r\\nLove this brand. All their moisturizers are great! I\\'ve been using this eye bomb for a few weeks now and have noticed my eyes look less tired than before. I\\'m continuing to use this\\r\\nWasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the biggest fan of it. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really see that much of a difference is using this product, so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure it was the price tag. It definitely hydrated the under eye, but not enough for me to keep buying it.\\r\\nThis brand is absolutely amazing, for one!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very gentle and does the job.  I typically use it when I do my night time skin care routine.. only purchased once, but I will buy this product again for sure\\r\\nThis is so amazing I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even explain it!! It is so moisturizing and just makes me feel so refreshed.\\r\\nFeels good on application but my under eye area still felt dry after a short time. Didn\\'t make a difference to my concealer application though.\\r\\nI have been using this product for approximately three weeks now and I absolutely love it. It has a smooth and light consistency that spreads very easily and it leaves the skin around my eyes feeling bouncy and refreshed. The scent is lovely too.\\r\\nIt moisturized under my eye is seconds. It comes with a decent amount of product. I use this very often and when I run out and go buy some more. It is very gentle in the face and does not burn, harm your eyes.\\r\\nI love this eye cream. My under eyes feel so moisturized and it has reduced the puffiness under my eyes. It is a little pricey though.\\r\\nThis eye cream is my favorite to give my undereyes a blast of hydration before going in with makeup.  It works so well. This product won\\'t help with wrinkles but if you are going in with a more matte concealer use this beforehand and it won\\'t dry out your undereyes causing those wrinkles to be exaggerated.\\r\\nNot the best. I gave it some stars because the amount of product you get, fresh smell and light weight however I was disappointed because this made my eye break out like crazy and that has never happened. I dont know if it was just my skin or what but wont be trying again.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\neye cream is so important, and this is one of my favorites! it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so refreshing and cooling when applied. I feel that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very effective. it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so gentle on the skin as well. I would recommend this for sure.\\r\\nI\\xc2\\xa0 have very dry skin and using a lot of wrinkle creams, I found my skin needing a little extra TLC. During the day, my face gets very tight, especially around my eyes. This is a great eye moisturizer. It plumps up my skin and gives my skin a great deal of moisture with out being sticky or heavy.\\r\\nDid not like this product made my skin irritated and had to discontinue use of the product\\r\\nI love this product! It really moisturized my undereyes and there was a clear difference in comparison to other undereye products. Would purchase again.\\r\\nThe Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is my all time favorite eye cream that I have tried so far. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great to use in the day time under makeup. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too thick or heavy at all. I believe it would be good for all skin types. If you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tried it I definitely recommend giving this a try.\\r\\nThis eye product is one of my top 3 eye creams I use. I prefer this for daytime eye moisturizing. It adds an instant glow to your under-eye, love this for my makeup free days as well because it is so glowy on its own. Great for fine lines and puffiness, have noticed a gradual reduction in the prominence of my dark under eye circles as well with using this. One of my holy grail products! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI just started using this eye cream and it is phenomenal! Its so smooth and sort of depuffs my under eyes which I love\\r\\nSo I don\\'t use this as an eye cream. I use it on the extra dry areas on my face and its great for hydration! I have very dry skin so I like anything that adds moisture.\\r\\nI find that this is moisturizing and does go on smooth. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m 36 years old and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a major issue with lines or wrinkles but was looking to stay ahead of the game. I have not noticed a change in existing lines but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have an issue with it in the first place.\\r\\nI got this as a sample in my Sephora play box and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lasted me for months, which gives me high hopes that the full size jar will last me forever lol! It smells amazing and goes on without being too oily and I think it definitely makes a difference in fading out the dark circles a bit. I absolutely love this so much!!\\r\\nI love this product. It\\'s hydrating on my skin. It doesn\\'t irritate my skin. I\\'ve been using this for the past month and I like it. It smells good and it\\'s light on the skin.\\r\\nThe eye bomb is honestly the bomb. If you have drier skin and really enjoy products that truly moisturize without waking up the next morning with your eyes crusted together. This is your product. It soaks into the skin so quickly and within the first day or so you can tell a difference.\\r\\nLove this eye moisturizer especially for the colder days and if you have very dry under eyes it will definitely kept your under eye moisturize with out being greasy and you just need the smallest amount this product will lash you forever !!!\\r\\nGiven that I\\'m 21 I feel like I don\\'t necessarily need an eye cream but I got one in my playbox anyways.\\xc2\\xa0After using this product, I now want to wear eye cream, if its this. It\\'s really really hydrating and is a thick texture when you\\'re putting it on your face, but feels super light on your face. Its a nice cool touch on your face and really does feel great.\\xc2\\xa0I recently started getting really bad dry eyes and I have dry patches on my lids and eye brows and now under my water line. My face creams were useless in dealing with that but this fixed it up really well after using it once!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI really enjoyed this eye cream. The scent is light and fresh, and the container lasted me 6+ months, so I definitely think it\\'s worth the price. It did a great job at keeping my eyes moisturized, but it didn\\'t do much for my fine lines. I would buy again though.\\r\\nJust started using it but I am in love. I am a teenager that has dark under eyes from lack of sleep but this lightens then and makes them super plump\\r\\nI use this product every time after I get out of the shower in combination with the belif aqua bomb. It is incredibly hydrating for my under eyes and a little bit goes a long way. I would repurchase this again!\\r\\nI love the way it made my under eyes look radiant. It took the puffiness away and the dark circles were lightened. I got this in my Sephora Play! box, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m considering purchasing it at a regular Sephora store. My Sephora at JC Penney doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t carry it.\\r\\nThis eye cream really works for your under eyes changes the elasticity makes under eyes look not wrinkly and takes away all dry patches and problems under the eyes. I love all belif skin care. I would purchase all belif skin care again.\\r\\nThis stuff has a great consistency and feel. Love putting this stuff on before bed for some overnight hydration!\\r\\nMy favorite eye cream of all time. It has a heavenly texture and works on both lids and under eye. I love the gel consistency, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hydrating without being heavy and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cause any milia. I would definitely recommend\\r\\nAmazing smell works great gives me a lot of moisture underneath my eyes also I received this in my Ipsy bag and it is a sample size but I still got a lot of use out of the jar that I was sent\\r\\nLove itttt! I wear it every night to bed and my under eyes have been so much better! I always use my ring finger to gently apply it too. Very moisturizing and not too fragrant. I will definitely pick this up.\\r\\nThis product is amazing and so gentle and hydrating on your under eyes. I would definitely repurchase and recommend to friends. The price you pay is worth the quality of the product.\\r\\nGot a sample from a ipsy package and it felt really creamy and refreshing on the under eyes.\\r\\nAre use this every single night, I\\'ve had it for about eight months now. It\\'s very large dries it without being heavy or greasy. It absorbs quite fast, which I like because I don\\'t feel I don\\'t like the feeling of product sitting on my face.\\r\\nThis eye cream does not feel heavy or sticky! It glides on your skins and you see a difference within 2 days.\\r\\nHas really done a lot for my undereyes, I usually apply it in the morning and it instantly brightens and hydrates. The only eye cream that I use!\\r\\nThis eye cream is amazing. Its lightweight but very hydrating with little to no scent! I would definitely recommend this and I\\'m obsessed with the packaging!\\r\\nI love the way this feels under the eyes. Very moisturizing and lightweight. I only got a small size . I fell in love with another skincare brand so I am giving their eye cream a try, but I may still buy another small size bacause this stuff feels so good.\\r\\nI love this product. I got it in my Ipsy bag and ended up buying the full size because I loved it. It feels so cooking and is perfect for summer. I always forget to put sunscreen on my eyelids and under my eyes and this soothes them so much if they get a little sunburnt. It makes your concealer go in flawlessly. I will probably buy this again when I run out.\\r\\nAmazing ! Love this product! Love the application and the way it feels on the face! Little pricey!\\r\\nI LOVE this eye cream. I\\'m only 19 so I\\'m not worried about aging eyes but my under eyes get really dry and this eye cream is wonderful. It\\'s really smooth and soaks into my skin fast leaving my under eyes feeling great.\\r\\nJ\\xe2\\x80\\x99ai enfin trouv\\xc3\\xa9 Le contour des yeux! Excellent en base de maquillage je n\\xe2\\x80\\x99ai plus le contour des yeux marqu\\xc3\\xa9s m\\xc3\\xaame en poudrant\\r\\nIt felt really nice once it soaked Into the skin and it made my under eyes very smooth. I got it off Ipsy and I really like it. And it made my expectations bc i rarely use eye creams and it could work more with under eye bags\\r\\nI cannot give this product enough of a rave review. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a life changing, game changing product. The most amazing amount of moisture in the tiniest amount of product - my eyes feel instantly quenched, my fine lines plump up and hide, and once it settle in your skin, it acts as the best under eye primer before makeup. Heaven. On. Earth.\\r\\nThis eye bomb applies on like a light cream, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty nice, but I have experienced some stinging irritation from time to time, especially when I had more compromised, overexfoliated skin.  I have a rather large sample of this that I got from a Belif set, which was nice to try. I still use it from time to time, but I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet fully committed to eye creams just yet.   Unsure of its actual benefits after a few months of use, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fun product if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the stinging.  via CosDNA: Potential acne triggers: Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Dimethicone, PEG-100 Stearate Potential irritants: Carbomer\\r\\nThis is very moisturising and cooling. It feels great to apply. It has a gel like consistency and a great smell.\\r\\nI have heard so many good things about the Belif line so I decided to pick up a trial size to try a few of the products out. This was my go-to for a good few months while using the trial size because a little goes a long way. When I first applied this, it kind of stung (but cooled) under my eyes. After a few times of applying it, the stinging went away and I was left with just a cooling sensation. This absorbs quickly into the under eye, but I did notice that towards the inner corner of my eye, it tends to ball up and makes it harder to spread out. This moisturizer definitely kept my under eyes from being dry and my under eye makeup from looking cakey.\\r\\nGot this in an Influenster box and fell in love, some of the best moisturizer I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used in my life.\\r\\nThis is a great moisturizing eye bomb. It leaves my eyes feeling refreshed and smooth. Mg undereyes also look less puffy.\\r\\nDoes what it promises to do\\xe2\\x80\\x94 moisturizes! Application of under eye concealer goes on smoothly after using this eye bomb. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen any other effects besides the moisturizing though. Wish it did more brightening or depuffing, but I guess I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to try another eye cream for that.\\r\\nI loooooooove this product! It moisturizers your under eye and makeup application afterwards is a dream! I use it at night and before I do my makeup.\\r\\nVery hydrating. Doubles as a moisturizer and eye shadow primer. I love a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone stop shop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d type of product! A little goes a very long way. Love this stuff\\r\\nso far so good... have only used a few times Will need to use for a few weeks at least to tell the difference, if any.\\r\\nSeems to keep the sensitive eye area moisturized & doesn\\'t clog pores. I got mine in a sephora beauty bag , so it\\'s small but it has lasted forever.\\r\\nI received a deluxe sample of this eye cream and liked it. It has a nice fresh scent and feels moisturizing under the eyes without being too heavy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little pricey but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d consider buying it full sized when I have a little extra cash for a splurge.\\r\\nI didnt want to buy into the hype of this one because of the price point and most people say you don\\'t need a separate eye cream but omg I love this. I have 46 year old skin and have very slight lines and this helps plump them right up and keeps the under eye mositurised. This will last a while because so little is needed but will definitely repurchase when I am done.\\r\\nVery moisturizing! I received a sample from ipsy and I really like it. It made my under eyes smooth and the formula is gentle for sensitive skin.\\r\\nLove this eye cream. I can tell a huge difference in the hydration of my undereyes. Does not leave me oily at all. Soaks into the skin fine and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cause makeup to cake up or separate. Would definitely recommend to someone with dry eye areas.\\r\\nThis is a really nice eye cream. I got a small trial in a beauty box an it\\'s lasted a really long time. A little bit goes a long way. Very hydrating without irritating my eyes.\\r\\nJust received this on my ipsy. I just love this product. It leaves your eyes look super.\\r\\nThis feels great when you put it on!  Helps with my tired eyes!   Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take much to do the job so it goes a long way!\\r\\nWhere do I begin?? I suffer from dry...super dry under eye...i was on the search for an eye cream at Sephora and came across this brand. I gave it a go because I also saw Casey Holmes loved it so purchased it. And omg it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfection! Sinks into my skin and seriously feels instantly hydrated. I use this at night and even before I put on my concealer. It makes for the perfect primer! I definitely am a belifer!\\r\\nI received this in my ipsy bag and a little goes a long way! I only have to dip the pad of my finger in a little bit to get a good amount of product. It smells really nice and feels good on my under eyes. I put this on in the morning and at night and find that it\\'s nice to wear under makeup to keep my skin feeling hydrated and healthy.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using a sample size of this eye bomb which is lasting me a few weeks now. I only use a little. It is lightweight and sets quickly without leaving a greasy residue. It is definitely moisturizing so it does what it says. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve enjoyed using it but if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re concerned about wrinkles, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think this will do much. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more hydrating than a cream to get rid of wrinkles. It would work best in the summertime or dry weather because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightweight so for dryer under eye area, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d need a thicker cream.\\r\\nOMG. This is a super moisturizing eye cream.\\xc2\\xa0 It is light weight, which I love, and it soaks in super fast.\\xc2\\xa0 I don\\'t have to sit there waiting for it to dry before putting my eye makeup, so it saves me a lot of time.\\xc2\\xa0 Ever since using it I noticed my under eye has been more moisturized, which is my main concern, cause I noticed that the previous eye cream I was using was not working so great.\\xc2\\xa0 If it really hot out, I like to put this in the refrigerator, and applied it in the morning for a refreshing wake up call.\\xc2\\xa0 Will definitely repurchase.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis stuff leaves nothing dehydrated under my very dry eyes. I have problems with my concealer turning creasy after about 3 hours but I made it 9 whole hours before it even started to turn creasy and I\\'ve noticed my dark circles are almost gone after only 2 weeks. This stuff is beyond amazing and I think yall should try it.\\r\\nI definitely notice a difference in my under-eye area. When I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use the cream, my eye bags are more pronounced. This cream has minimized the lines under my eyes. I also apply this cream to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cparenthesis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d lines on the side of my mouth and it works really well there too!\\r\\nI think it is a nice eye cream if hydration is your only concern. I did not feel like it did much more than that. It last for ever. I got it as part of a gift set\\r\\nI could give this cream 10 stars if that was an option! I love it so so so much! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insanely hydrating and stays on all day. It has improved the skin around my eyes and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look so tired all the time now. I love it!!\\r\\nI was so excited to try this I thought it was gonna fix all my eye problems but after a month of use I really didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice any difference at all. I was super disappointed so the eye cream search continues.\\r\\nI have noticed a huge difference since using this cream! I wear makeup almost every day, and before applying it, I put the belif moisturizing eye bomb and it makes a huge difference! I don\\'t get the ugly creases or crows feet on my eyes! I\\'m a huge believer in this cream! Highly recommend!\\r\\nI have very oily and dry skin so eye cream can be a toss-up for me.\\xc2\\xa0 Either it leaves my under eye very oily, or doesn\\'t help enough.\\xc2\\xa0 This eye cream really sinks in and moisturizers.\\xc2\\xa0 Highly recommend!\\r\\nThis eye cream has become my new favorite. Soooo good! It soaks right in and leaves my under eyes feeling hydrated and refreshed. Use it in the AM and PM and works well with makeup.\\r\\nHow could you not love this product!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s by far my most favorite eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so great for dry under eye area and leaves you going to bed feeling cool and moisturized. I definitely recommend.\\r\\nVery moisturizing. It sinks into the skin relatively quickly and makeup sits well on top of it.\\r\\nNice consistency and absorbs fine but doesn\\'t seem to do anything more than the regular moisturizing cream.\\r\\nThis is not my favorite eye cream. \\xc2\\xa0My eyes would water when using this eye cream. \\xc2\\xa0I do not have a problem with other eye creams. \\xc2\\xa0It did keep that area moisturized nicely, but I don\\'t want to tear up every time I use a product. \\xc2\\xa0Because of this, I will not repurchase this item. \\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI received a sample of this and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only been using it for a few days, but I do notice a difference. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much for firming, but it is super hydrating. So if that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the only thing you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re aiming for, I would recommend this!\\r\\nThis is a great eye cream! I had dry spots under my eyes and within 2 uses it helped take it away. A little goes a long way which is nice because it is a little expensive for my liking for such a little amount of product. It\\'s easy to apply, the jar it comes in is nice and easy to open.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI love this eye cream! I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really have much creasing yet but my undereyes can get somewhat dry throughout the day and this cream is great at hydrating! It sits well under makeup concealer and my eyes still look good when I get home from work. I would recommend it\\r\\nI am 25 years old about to turn 26,  it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time for me to start using an eye cream.  I got a sample of this through Ipsy, it was very gentle and hydrating.  The sample size was a great size, and after checking the pricing, I decided I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d buy the full.  My under eye area looks much better after using this for a week!\\r\\nI absolutely love this eye cream. I use it twice a day. The packaging looks super classy on my bathroom counter too!! It is super moisturizing and leaves my eyes looking super bright! I will always use this product!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only used this product a few times. It does so well in moisturizing and cooling my under eyes, but it does not really help with dark under eyes.\\r\\nI use this before bed and occasionally in the morning when my skin feels extra dry. It helps keeping my under eye moist so that my makeup doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t flake and look Cakey dry. I recommend and price wise it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth it. Just a little dab goes a long way.\\r\\nThis is a hydrating eye mask without being tacky or greasy. It is easily absorbed into skin, and it feels like it cools and de-puffs the eye area. It works well under makeup and as a night eye cream. I would repurchase.\\r\\nBelif makes such great products. I generally shy away from things that come in little pots but I absolutely love this cream..I use it every night before bed under my eyes.\\r\\nThe texture of eye creams is so important to me and this one just glides on. So moisturizing!\\r\\nWhat can I say, I love the stuff. Not only does it smell amazing but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extremely hydrating, very gentle and good for a contact lens wearers. My only gripe is that it is $48 for less than 1 ounce. I tend to be a bit heavy-handed when it comes to skin care especially eye cream and I feel like I ran through my tub of this extremely quickly I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m debating whether to re-purchase this or try something a little bit cheaper considering I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still under the age of 30.\\r\\nThis eye bomb is very moisturizing. I can definitely see a difference in my under eyes. I had been looking into eye creams and this one is great.\\r\\nWorks well to moisturize the under eye region, keeps hydration around the eyes and gives off a dewy healthy glow. Smells good and is a nice texture. Could possibly repurchase when I run out of my current tub.\\r\\nThis product smells divine and lasts for AGES. It is definitely a moisturizing product and I felt like the eye area looked fresher and somehow, less gaunt. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m giving it four stars because I believe there is room for improvement. I would like this product to offer more benefits because some of my big concerns are wrinkles and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel that the eye bomb addresses that as much as other eye creams. For a general moisturizer, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great. If you have trouble with crows feet, you might want to find a more powerful cream.\\r\\nThere is a reason this is the #1 eye cream! It is so good. I am a 22 year old college student who has had their fair share of late nighters. However, when I use this under my eyes at night you can\\'t tell at all. It is expensive, but it is one of the few skincare products that I think it worth the price. Highly recommend, even for those in their twenties who don\\'t think they need an eye cream yet!\\r\\nThis is by far the best moisturizer I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used for my eyes. It leaves your under eyes feeling so soft and smooth. The biggest bonus is you only need the tiniest bit each use, so the bottle will last forever!\\r\\nI absolutely love this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really lightweight and basically melts right into your skin. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave any residue so you can wear during the day. I wear it with the aqua bomb moisturizer and my skin is so soft. I will definitely be repurchasing.\\r\\nSuch a beautiful and moisturizing eye cream!!! I cannot day enough good things about this product! Sephora sells amazing bundle deals where you can get deluxe size samples to try out the brand before you buy. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d go that route before committing to a full size when it comes to any skincare product.\\r\\nI love this eye product! I\\'ve tried a few in the past and they did absolutely nothing or gave me a rash but this one keeps my under eyes so hydrated and nice!!\\r\\nHands down the best eye moisturizer I\\'ve used. It\\'s very gentle and immediately absorbs into the skin. My concealer always looks so smooth and creaseless whenever I used this. Will continue to repurchase!\\r\\nAmazing! My makeup applies so much better with this on! My under eyes are much more hydrated and plump.\\r\\nA little of this goes a long way. Which makes it an awesome value. It is super hydrating and gentle on the under eye area. I found it to be extremely effective. I would not only recommend to others but am about to order another one!\\r\\nMy favorite eye cream I love it!. The first time when I used was Thai you to Sephora play and omg I had to go to Sephora and buy the biggest size is amaizing I strongly recommend this cream!. You will see the result quickly!. Less dryness more beautiful eye skin!.\\r\\nI received this as a sample size from Sephora, and I absolutely love it! It provides so much hydration under my eyes, but is so lightweight. I also love that there is no heavy scent to this product. If you pop this in the fridge before applying, it feels nice and refreshing early in the morning. This is a morning must have for me!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nLove this. One of the nicest eye treatments i have used. I only wish it was cruelty free.  Super moisturizing and not oily at all.\\r\\nMoisturizes skin and moisturizes area under eye Keep skin moisturized for a long time you can put this cream berfore the foundation\\r\\nLOVE! I will definitely be purchasing this product again. The smell is incredible and moisturizes without leaving my skin oily or shiny. The cream is light and easily moveable for smooth coverage and blending. Incredible product.\\r\\nI first received the Belief Eye Bomb in a value set from Sephora. I love it. It is great when your eyes are feeling dry and helps with the blending of my concealer. I will say I feel it helps reduce the dark circles under my eye but it is not that great for antiageing. Still, I would recommend it as a great moisturizing eye cream.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis is a super hydrating and brightening eye moisturizer! Use it everyday and no fine lines or wrinkles!\\r\\nHoly Grail eye cream. I love it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more like a gel. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m able to use it under my makeup with no problem. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give me those little white bumps. I love everything I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used from Belif, I will continue to repurchase and recommend this product.\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb does moisturize skin around the eyes. It feels great, doesn\\'t irritate or doesn\\'t makes skin greasy. It leaves skin soft and smooth. Love it!\\r\\nThis really moisturizes the under eye area but I think it is a little too thick for me. I got a sample in my Sephora Play box a few months ago and I still have over half left since I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to put too much on. If I do, it ends up just clumping up and looking weird.\\r\\nI absolutely LOVE this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so light yet so moisturising. I have a dry undereye area and I have tried so many oils and serums before but this has worked the best so far! BUY IT! Absolutely recommend this to anyone who want brighter and a smoother eye area!\\r\\nThis eye bomb is amazing I use it every night after my shower along with the belif true cream moisturizing bomb. I went into a Sephora and had help finding this because I had really bad dark under eye spots but I can honestly say they\\'re getting a lot better and I will never stop using this\\r\\nWorked great on my under eyes.  There was a lot of product for the small container. It helped my eyelids as well to prepare them for my makeup routine.\\r\\nThis product I got as a sample from Sephora. It is a light gel texture which easily absorbs in the skin. It gives the eyes a hydrated but not heavy feeling so I think it is best for combo or oily skin. The texture makes it easy to apply makeup after\\r\\nI got this cream in my ipsy bag this month. I used it under my eyes and oh my god the cream is so moisturising and soothing. I never realised I needed an eye cream until I used this and felt a huge difference. I loved it and would be buying more of it.\\r\\nReceived this in my Ipsy bag and OMG, I love this cream. It feels so good when you put this on in the morning, pretty effective for puffy eyes, smells and feels fresh. Would definitely buy again\\r\\nThis is like a magic worker to my eyes. Usually I have dark circle that are super notifing. This eye cream helps a lot during those awful dark circle days.\\r\\nThis is going to be fairly confusing based on my review, but this is a good eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very basic and an amazing price. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really moisturizing for the under eye area, unfortunately I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need moisture as much as brightening. But for everyone who just needs a little moisture for your eyes, give this gem a try!\\r\\nOmg love this eye cream! I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I can live without it. It feels amazing and makes me look like I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had hours of sleep even when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m exhausted! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis is by far my favorite eye moisturizer. Not only do I already love their face Aqua Bomb, but being able to try out the Eye Bomb, was awesome. The scent is amazing and the touch and feel of the product are great. I love this product and will continue to use it in my cleansing routine from now on.\\r\\nThe name for this product is perfect cuz it is a moisture bomb right for your face it feels so moist Rising hence the name it\\'s a can\\'t do no wrong product my book.\\r\\nI LOVE this eye cream!! I got a sample from Ipsy and am so tempted to buy the full size, even with the higher price tag than I would typically spend. I\\'ve tried other eye creams and this is by far my favorite. It\\'s so moisturizing which is the number one thing I look for in an eye cream. A lot of other eye creams are harsh on my sensitive skin and this could not be gentler. I\\'m also a huge fan of the scent, almost a light citrusy scent,\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis product is okay. I think it moisturizes my undereyes but I dont feel like it\\'s the absolute best like the aqua bomb is.\\r\\nWant to love it but eh. It works well but not thick enough for a lasting crease less day. It tends to oxidize my concealer unless I use this at night or let it dry before applying my concealer on.\\r\\nI love the cool feeling you get when you put this on. It was well worth the price point because you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to put a lot on for the intense hydration. Love it.\\r\\nThis stuff is amazing! I didn\\'t even think I had dry eyes to begin with, but this eye moisturizer completely blew me away. I wear it every day AM and PM. A little goes a long way, so this will last me a long time.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nSo good! South Florida is humid so I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to worry too much about dry skin. However, when I use matte make up I always refreshed my under eyes with this moisturizer!\\r\\nAs a sensitive skin sufferer, I\\'ve got to hand it to them that this is the only eye product I\\'ve used that doesn\\'t cause my eyes to burn and water. It\\'s very hydrating and my new go to eye cream.\\r\\nthis stuff is amazing!!! i got a sample in my ipsy bag & I loved it. it was instantly refreshing and felt as if it was instantly tightening my under eye. the only reason I give it four stars is because if I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a sample I probably wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have bought it myself because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so expensive!\\r\\nI love the intense burst of moisture from this eye product. It is light weight so I usually use it in combination with an eye cream to lock in that hydration. I would purchase this again.\\r\\nI recently purchased this...so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only been using it for a week but I am quite impressed. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using La Mer for at least a year but purchased this after reading great reviews on it under makeup. I am hooked!\\r\\nThis I cream is absolutely amazing every single time I use it I feel like my under eyes are completely hydrated. It is also a great primer for concealer. I wish it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so expensive! But I would definitely buy again\\r\\nSeriously LOVE this. Super hydrating and smooth. Lasts all day. Smells great and doesn\\'t break me out or feel greasy.\\r\\nI received this from a subscription box and love it! This is probably my new favorite eye cream. It feels really good when you put it on and is very hydrating. It only takes a small amount of product. I\\'ll buy again.\\r\\nI just got a deluxe sample size of this eye cream in my June 2018 ipsy bag but had otherwise never heard of it. I\\'ve been using it for about a week and can say that it is very moisturizing without being super thick or sticky. It also blends easily and works with concealer so there are no streaks or patches.\\r\\nI use this product daily. It helps my concerler go on nicely, however I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that it does much for your skin.  It does not claim to be anti-aging or anything, it seems more like an under eye moisturizer. I do like it though! Again great for under your makeup.\\r\\nI LOVE THIS EYE CREAM! If you have dry under eyes you need this! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so hydrating and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make your concealer look cakey at all!! I love it! Will purchase forever!\\r\\nReceived a pot of this eye cream with one of my beauty subscription boxes recently. The consistency wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as rich and creamy as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve come to expect from an eye cream, so initially my expectations were low. I continued to use it as part of my nightly routine. A little goes a long way, so it took about a month for me to finish the sample pot. That was a week ago, and\\xc2\\xa0only now am I realizing just how much it improved the appearance of my under-eye skin! My concealer, foundation, powder, etc. didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t crease or look cakey and dry. If it weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t for the semi-steep price tag, I would already own a new pot. Definitely changed my perspective on eye creams.\\r\\nThis is sooo moisturizing! I need it and I love it. I sometimes have excema on my eye lids and this helps so much. Bc my eye lid skin is think and well on my eye ball I cannot use a steroid cream there. This cream does the trick. It leaves my eye area moisturized, dewy and luminous. I highly recommend for Angie with dry areas around their eye!! I took off one star bc I wish it also had anti aging benefits. It definitely smooths what I already have but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it prevents anything. I always use a stronger anti aging product at night.\\r\\nThis can be used at night or in the morning. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just so soft and refreshing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not harsh at all.\\r\\nI use this day and night and put a little bit on but a little bit goes a long way. It is a bit pricey but it will do the job and has a long term effect, the packaging is amazing but I do wish that it was a little bit cheaper so I can buy it in bulk! other than that its amazing!\\r\\nLove this hydrating eye cream. I first got it as a sample at Sephora but had to purchase the full size because it worked so well. It has a gel like consistency, very light weight, and works wonders under makeup. It hydrates and smooths my under eye area and reduces the look of fine lines. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed long term affects or changes in my under eye lines, but this keeps the under eyes hydrated upon application.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI love love love this eye cream! This is for sure my favorite eye cream and I would 200% recommend this eye cream! I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that you can get a better eye cream than this eye cream. I think that this is the best eye cream I have ever tried!\\r\\nThis seems like nothing special and it does what it claims. With saying that, I can tell when I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it and I love he texture!! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI really enjoyed using this eye balm. I think the packaging is very cute and effective for the product. This product did meet my expectations and feels very nice on the eyes. The price is a little high in my opinion but I received a small sample size in my sephora play bag.\\r\\nNice gel formula for under eye area. I like the fact that they honestly tell that it is just a moisturizer. Because I feel like all the other under eye moisturizers claim to do so much but really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything but moisturize. This one is working well and a jar lasts forever. Good value.\\r\\nI use the eye bomb every morning and night, especially if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m wearing makeup. It smoothes out and moisturizes my under eyes. My concealer goes on smooth and creases way less throughout the day verses when I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use the cream.\\r\\nI got a trial size to try and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being doing what it claims to do. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely moisturizing and under eyes do feel much healthier in the morning. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it does anything beyond providing moisture for my under eyes. I think there are other products out there in the similar price range that provide more benefits\\r\\nI wanted to love this so bad. This really fills in fine lines and I can notice a difference almost instantly. However, this gives me terrible milia under my eyes. After three uses my under eyes looked horrible. If you have extremely sensitive under eyes like me I would stay away from this eye cream.\\r\\nThis works!!!  I\\'ve been using it for two days and I can see the difference within a hour of using it its worth the price I have dark circles and there almost gone\\r\\nI recently discovered the skincare brand Belif and I absolutely love their products especially how lightweight they feel on the face and hydrating.\\r\\nThis stuff is AMAZING. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really need an eye bomb so I have to go my mom and she noticed drastic changes to her under eye bags. Plus it smells absolutely awesome.\\r\\nProduct leaves the under moisturizing and leaves under eye area feeling hydrated.  If I had a party-harry weekend and when Monday comes around my body is dying of thirst inside this definitely gives my eyes a boost of hydration. Not often do I get dehydrated but when I do I definitely go to this product to pick me back up.\\r\\nI love this stuff! It feels so nice under the eye area, definitely a must for any skin care routine!\\r\\nI only tried a sample of this cuz I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m too cheap lol but I really liked this and if the price wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so expensive I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d buy 100\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this product for the past couple months and I love it!!! I got this as part of an Influenster campaign. It leaves my skin and under eyes looking refreshed and bright! I would definitely buy this product again!\\r\\nOriginally got it (along with the rest of the line) because it was one of the first Korean products In sephora (yes, I\\'m korean) - not expecting too much. But it\\'s amazing!\\r\\nIn love with this. I\\'ve been looking for a serum for my eyes and this might just be it. A little bit goes a long way, as with most serums. It absorbs well and smells awesome. I received a sample and I\\'m going to use it all up to see how the long term use affects my skin. If it\\'s helping with my fine lines, I\\'m buying for sure!\\r\\nThe best eye cream!! Seriously it is so hydrating and I use it morning and night. It even works well under my makeup. I have never used an eye cream that I enjoy as much. Even Casey Holmes is raving about this!!\\r\\nI love this eye moisturizer.. it really does leave your under eye feeling hydrated and soft. I use this both morning and night and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found that it works well under concealer. It won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help with dark circles if that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you are needing. I have very dry skin and really appreciate what this does for me.\\r\\nLove love love this eye cream, it is so incredibly light and very effective. I think this eye cream is an absolute must. I have oily skin and struggle finding eye creams that don\\'t make me more oily or make my makeup crease during the day.\\r\\nUn tr\\xc3\\xa8s  bon produit qui hydrate bien le contour de l\\'oeil et procure une sensation de fra\\xc3\\xaecheur. Foncez\\r\\nThis product worked quite well. It felt very moisturizing and nourishing under the eyes and made them feel soft and smooth. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t attest to any long term effects since I do not feel I am old enough to see the benefits of an eye cream, I do think it is good to start using one early on and this one in particular is great.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve struggled to find a good eye cream, and this takes the cake! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so moisturizing and my concealer goes on beautifully over this. You only need the smallest amount so although it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pricy, it will last awhile. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great formula for anyone with fine lines and dryness!\\r\\nI used this product for a month stray. After a long day applying this on felt very refreshing. The next day I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see a huge difference but the skin was a bit brighter. I do like to bring this when I travel.\\r\\nLove have this eye balm just glides on the skin leaving it so silky and moisturized. I received this in a Sephora play box and wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t definitely purchase this again. Use this at night and wake up well refreshed under eyes.\\r\\nThis was a very good product that delivered long lasting under eye moisture. I received it in a Sephora kit. I am considering buying it to use again because I was happy with the results.\\r\\nI love belif and I love eye creams! A little of this cream goes a long way. It is thick and creamy but seems to absorb nicely. The texture is great overall and my skin feels so moisturized and soft. The scent is not overpowering at all, but pleasant. I love it.\\r\\nI got this as a sephora play sample and I absolutely love it. Super hydrating and smells really good!\\r\\nthis stuff is great. i use this at night. i feel like it does hydrate my under eyes. it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything for the puffiness but i really just need it for hydration. a little bit goes a long way too. i would recommend this product!\\r\\nI used to have super dry under eyes. Noticed this because when I applied makeup on it they would look AWFUL. Saw many reviews on this cream and is safe to say, I am never letting it go. It is BOMB AF\\r\\nThe packaging is beautiful. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a blue frosted glass with a plastic black screw on lid. This was my first time using it and I feel like it was a bit disappointing. I personally wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy it again. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expensive but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live up to my expectations. It smells refreshing but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hydrate as well as I thought it would; especially, because of its price. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried more inexpensive products that work better than this.\\r\\nJust loved! It really makes good for your skin, it hydrates and smells good, the finishing is not shining, the pack is nice and im gonna buy it again! You can find it at Sephora and online! Recommending to everyone!\\r\\nWonderful hydrating moisturizer for the eye! I love putting it on right after I wash my face and put on a face moisturizer -- makes me feel super pampered. Rubs in very easy and has a pleasantly mild scent. I am still young but worried about those creeping crow\\'s feet, so just trying to delay it as much as I can by moisturizing often!\\r\\nI love this brand and every-time i get a sample in a subscription box i make it last! This brand is amazing!\\r\\nThis was great! I am always looking for a new eye cream and this impressed. I use it at night and wake up with moistured under eyes\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using the eye bomb for about two weeks now. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed a tremendous amount of difference yet but it definitely hydrates and fills in my fine lines around my eyes. I love the texture of it and it sinks right into my skin.  *Update!!! The eye bomb is definitely the bomb! My fine lines around my eyes and in between my nose have significantly been reduced.\\r\\nIt\\'s pretty good but not really excellent. I can feel it moisturizes the skin under my eyes but not that much compared to another eye cream I have tried and used.\\r\\nThis eye cream is definitely super hydrating. I do not have major eye concerns so I cannot say if it helps with dark spots or wrinkles but if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for hydration I think that this would be great and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very gentle and light.\\r\\nSuch a lightweight, yet super hydrating formula! Easy to open, and easy to use! I love the gentle formula that hydrated for 26 hours! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still hydrating when I reapply! I even got a compliment during my Sephora perk facial about the skin around my eyes! Hello! Major confidence boost! Love this and so do my eyes!\\r\\nThis is an amazing eye cream!! Easily one of the best ones that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little pricey, however it does last a long time. I bought mine at Sephora for the first time! I would recommend this to others!\\r\\nI LOVE this, I got it in a Sephora play and it was everything I had been looking for! For the first few times I used it I LOVED it! But I found that it just isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a good value for the price when you have dry skin! Sorry \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x91belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nAbsolutely loved this cream I received. It smelled good and had a nice texture to it and a little went a long way. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure that I would pay full price for it but I really enjoyed it.\\r\\nI love this product. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating for my under eye. I highly suggest this product for anyone with extra dry under eyes. I always use it before I apply my makeup and it goes on seamlessly.\\r\\nI love belifs ingredients, smell, packaging, texture, everything but the results of this eye cream. Left my sensitive skin with Milia dots under and around the corners of the eyes. Would not repurchase.\\r\\nEverything about this brand is amazing! Bought a travel size and this came with it. Such a great product! It def works!\\r\\nI have tried tons of under eye creams looking for one that will reduce the dryness. This is one of the best I have  tried so far.\\r\\nI have oily skin but I do still feel like my under eyes need hydration. I use this day and night and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seriously amazing! I feel like my under-eyes are so moisturized and helps a ton when applying concealer under the eyes.\\r\\nI\\'ve tried this product a few times and haven\\'t noticed a difference. It does hydrate but in combination with the moisture bomb moisturizer you can\\'t tell where the hydration comes from, the eye cream or the moisturizer.\\r\\nI have dry skin and slightly thinning skin under my eyes. I never used to bother with under-eye creams/lotions, relying on my regular moisturizer to do the job, as I never saw any difference when using a specific moisturizer for under the eyes. Until I found this.  I received a sample size jar and figured I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d give it a try, especially since I received it in the winter time when all my skin was at its driest and needed all the help it could get.  Although I find this cream light and absorbing enough to wear under makeup, I mostly use it in my night time routine and am continually surprised how good my eyes are looking when I wake up in the morning.  This will now have a permanent place in my must-haves. I highly recommend trying it out, especially if no other under eye product seems to make a difference to your skin.\\r\\nI really like this eye cream. It absorbs fast and isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t greasy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty pricey but a little goes a long way! This is my first time trying it and I would buy it again.\\r\\nI use this in the morning prior to makeup. I give it enough time to absorb and it keeps my concealer from creasing. Feels cool and nice going on. Doesnt feel greasy or take forever to absorb.\\r\\nMy go to eye cream! This stuff is so light feeling and just glides onto my skin. Keeps my under eye area moisturized all day/night. By far the best eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried yet. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten many compliments from others saying I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve looked more awake lately (I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m definitely not, I have a two year old son) and my fine lines are less noticeable. I swear it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the eye bomb! Definitely expensive.. but totally worth the splurge!\\r\\nUsing this eye cream right now and I am very happy with it. Highly moisturizing, sinks in beautifully, and layers well under makeup.\\r\\nI LOVEEEEE this moisturizer. It has helped my under eyes feel refreshed and HYDRATED. I also use this as a primer for those days that I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t slept and it definitely helps with my lines.\\r\\nMy boyfriend actually received this as a sample on his last purchase of the moisturizing bomb (we are both HUGE belif fans) and boy it does not disappoint. Just like their moisturizers, the eye cream feels like a big drink of water for your skin. And it KEEPS your skin feeling fresh all day. No harsh scents, and very gentle. I keep this in my freelancing kit!\\r\\nThis product was amazing for my undereyes. I got it as a sample in a sephora set and I cherished it to the last little drop. It\\'s thick but not too thick that you can\\'t wear it under makeup. It just feels super refreshing under the eyes and so moisturizing. The only thing that is going to keep me from repurchasing this is that Belif is not cruelty free which is really disappointing because I really enjoyed this product.\\r\\nI love this product it definitely does the job on hydrating my eyes. I tend to use this product more in the winter than the spring because I am obsessed with Ole Henriksen Banana Bright Eye Creme. Overall, I recommend this product to everyone as a must try or have in your skincare cabinet !!!\\r\\nI have struggled for years to find a moisturizing eye cream that actually works and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my sensitive skin and I have finally found it! This stuff is a cream/gel texture and I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it would hydrate as much as it does. After just 3 uses, my dry patches under my eyes completely disappeared. My eyes feel hydrated and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thin enough that it works under makeup. Completely worth the money!!!\\r\\nSo moisturizing and a little goes a long way! I still am battling the fine lines under my eyes, but I am hopeful about the eye bomb. I love how my under eye feels after applying and with time I feel I will see more improvement with fine lines as I have only been using this for a week or so.\\r\\nThis stuff is great! I love how moisturizing it is under my eyes. I use it day and night! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not greasy feeling and my concealer goes on great over it!\\r\\nSo grateful that influenster sent me this to try out. It\\'s been a hot minute since I\\'ve been using it and the difference in my under eyes is tremendous. My under eyes are so hydrated thanks to this product and my concealer has gone on smoother than ever. I do wish it helped with the appearance of dark circles it but it doesn\\'t claim to do that in the first place any way it\\'s just supposed to hydrate and it does a really good job of that\\r\\nI am only 19, so I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have very mature skin, but I love using this eye cream at night because it makes it so my concealer doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t crease the next morning. I got a sample size in my Sephora play and I feel like I will never run out!\\r\\nLove this to deeply moisturize under my eyes since they are so dry. Very effective and smells fresh. Only thing it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t firm the skin, but they offer a eye cream that does that and I want to try that next. Overall wonderful eye cream and works great under concealer as well. Perfect consistency. Also is good for sensitive skin, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make my eyes burn or anything. Love!\\r\\nsuper gentle and moisturizing. i apply this as the last step of my skincare routine before bed and also before i put on makeup. it helps the undereyes to stay moisturizer and prevents creasing\\r\\nThis is probably the most moisturizing eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave a greasy or heavy feeling under my eyes. Once it dries it feels like there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing there. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any wrinkles under my eyes, but I think this eye cream would probably be helpful for people who do.\\r\\nI had gotten a sample of this eye cream in a Sephora play box (which is amazing, by the way). I had never knew using an eye cream was important until recently and now I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I can go without it.\\r\\nI love this eye bomb so much! I have really dry skin and this works amazingly underneath my eyes. I adore it so much and it is also great under my foundation. I can definitely see the difference within a week! Worth every penny!\\r\\nWhile I really enjoyed the feeling of this eye cream under my eyes, it didn\\'t really offer the level of moisture I was looking for. I would wake up in the morning and my eyes felt a little dry under my skin. I think I would try this again during the summer months, but for my normal skin, it didn\\'t provide enough moisture during the winter. \\r\\nI have been loving this stuff. It hydrates my under eye. I love using it before applying my concealer and it smooth everything out . I just wish it helped with wrinkles.\\r\\nReally great moisturizing cream. It feels so coooling under your eyes! If your eyes are sensitive to strong smells then definitely wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recommend. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice much difference with dark circles or hydration under the eyes though.\\r\\nThis is a great moisturizing eye cream! I love the texture of this - thick and rich. Perfect for your delicate eye area. A little goes a long way so this will last you forever! I love using this as part of my night routine. A great eye cream!\\r\\nThis is such a nice thick eye cream made for hydration. My under eyes are usually so dry but this has helped them!\\r\\nLoved this. I have sensitive skin especially my eye area. Have me the moisture i needed without being too much. I didn\\'t notice any milia.\\r\\nBest eye cream ever!  It sinks into the skin and leaves the skin looking plump and feels hydrating all day. Makeup applies over it beautifully. Plus you only need a tiny dab.\\r\\nThis eye cream is literally the BOMB. For someone who suffers from dry under eyes I really was looking for something that would hydrate even under makeup. This is thin enough to wear under concealer and really keeps my under eye from wrinkling or getting too dry. A little goes along way as well! Love it!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nNice soothing gel texture but I didn\\'t notice any long term effects. Provided some short term hydration. Probably wouldn\\'t repurchase but it wasn\\'t absolutely useless\\r\\nI love this. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so moisturizing, and a little goes a long way. I will buy this again.\\r\\nGreat moisturizing under eye cream. Keeps my under eyes hydrated and helps my concealer go on smoother\\r\\nIt is alright, kept my undereyes moisturized but I do not feel like it did anything to combat my dark circles or fine lines\\r\\na really unique texture for an eye cream that makes my under eyes feel smooth and plump. i have a sample size and would buy the full size\\r\\nGreat product. It leaves my under eye more hydrated and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed a difference when putting on my makeup. It also doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make me break out. A little goes a long way and I find the product to be worth the price.\\r\\nOn days that I\\'m really dry and had a long night of studying or just staying up late, I LOVE to use this eye cream in combination with the Aqua Bomb moisturizer. It leaves my under eyes really hydrated!\\r\\nI use the belif eye cream which I also love! It\\'s very hydrating and my under eyes feel so much smoother.\\r\\nVery thick. I mostly use it at night or before make up. It gets my skin looking plump and hydrated for the day.\\r\\nThis cream is fantastic. I got it at Sephora, and it is great for day or night. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extremely moisturizing, and is good for the entire eye area. I broke down and purchased this after using 5+ samples because I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring myself to spend the money, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad I have it.\\r\\nI love the texture of this gel. It\\'s so light and smooth. It feels cool and refreshing, and it absorbs quickly.\\r\\nIs the best thing that you can use for your dark circles, is super hidrating and you feel like water, refreshing very much your eyes\\r\\nVery moisturizing eye cream. Perfect to use before applying makeup. Makes under eyes look hydrated and fresh.\\r\\nLove this product!! The consistency is great not too thick! So moisturizing! I can really tell a difference when using this product! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis is a pretty basic eye cream. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much for puffiness or dark circles but it does moisturize the under eye. Therefore I like to use this at night. I probably would not buy again.\\r\\nThe BEST eye cream I have ever used.\\xc2\\xa0 I am in my late thirties and noticed some small lines.\\xc2\\xa0 I started using this twice a day and I am sold! The lines are pretty much gone and its helps my makeup go on so smoothly.\\xc2\\xa0 \\r\\nI love the way this makes my under eye area look. The only downside is that it makes my eyes burn a little bit.\\r\\nI use this every morning under my concealer. I like it but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help with the creasing and I feel like it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t absorb as quickly as I hope considering it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a gel. It is very cooling so it feels really nice on the undereye area.\\r\\nI LOVED THIS. It hydrates your eyes and when you wake you in te morning they feel great. it\\'s very gentle when you apply it.\\r\\nI got a trial size, but it was definitely enough because you only need a little bit to make your under eyes feel moisturized. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use too much, regardless, because an excess amount can leave your skin feeling a bit thick.\\r\\nLoving this product and a little goes a long way. I received this item complimentary for testing purposes. The product is gentle and effective on the skin. I prefer using it at night when since the consistency of the product is somewhat thick.\\r\\nThe smell was nice. Dont think i would buy this product. I found it heavy and greasy and my eye makeup smudged under my eye due to it the application was smooth and the scent was magnificent, but that wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be enough to win me over.\\r\\nI really like this eye bomb. I use it every night. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very refreshing and it really feels lights and smooth. I spread it out over my cheek bones because it feels really hydrating. I do feel like it keeps my under eyes looking refreshed and light!!\\r\\nlove this eye cream!! very hydrating. i use it before bed and in the morning!! all natural is always good, i love that kbeauty brands never put chemicals in their products\\r\\nThis is a miracle worker. The texture of this product feels so hydrating but not sticky. I put this on at night after my normal skincare routine and I just get so excited to dip into it. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice any smell but if there were I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind that. By far one of the best eye creams I have ever used.\\r\\nI have never used an eye cream before, but have always heard other people talk about how much they love them and how good they are for aging eyes. I enjoyed using this eye cream. Did not see a ton of difference in my eyes and the skin surrounding them. But I was pleased with how it felt on.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis product is very soothing to the under eye. It also had helped my fine lines I have around my eyes. It\\'s very creamy and fragrance free.\\r\\nI got this  as a sample and have been using it for a few months. I got 5ml/0.17 fl oz in the sample. Lasts forever!! You only need a little bit like it honestly honestly goes a long way. When I put too much I have to basically blend it down my cheeks. It is very light weight. I feel like my under eyes are very soft. I don\\'t have problems with dark circles or bags but with my sleeping schedule, sometimes my eyes are puffier than other days. So I really like this. I feel like it makes me look rested even though tho I wanna pass out or I\\'m hungover.\\r\\nIt leaves my under eyes so smooth so when I apply make up it goes on so nice and it feels very hydrating\\r\\nI like this eye cream! I was a bit wary at first when I noticed the tiniest burning feeling around my eyes after using this product. It was only the first time and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen again so not quite sure about that. It is very moisturizing although I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice any other effects from this. I like to use this at night and the Banana Bright Eye Cr\\xc3\\xa8me in the mornings!\\r\\nMy undereyes werent a desert but they were dry enough to mess with concealers. I put this on at night after i wash my face and ten minutes before i put makeup on and it makes such a huge diffrence in my undereyes. I find they\\'ve gotten much less dry and more plumped. I highly recommend this\\r\\nThis eye cream is so bomb.  It is extremely thick but still light weight and I really feel that it makes a difference in how puffy my eyes are the next morning. I am really big into I creams as I have a little tiny bags under my eyes but when I use this they disappear.\\r\\nI noticed significant change using this product! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a makeup artist and I typically wear a full face of makeup when working with clients on on a shoot. That being said, my under eye area has definitely seen better days. Dark circles , even dryness at times. I used this product before bed and after 1 week I noticed that area more plump & hydrated. Dark circles are still there but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be unfair to believe a product can perform magic !\\r\\nThis is such a great product! I\\xef\\xb8\\x8ft is very gentle and soothing for the skin. As soon as I\\xef\\xb8\\x8f use I\\xef\\xb8\\x8ft I feel like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s working. I\\xef\\xb8\\x8f have oily/acne prone skin and this works perfectly with I\\xef\\xb8\\x8ft! A brand I trust and would recommend this to anyone!\\r\\nHoly grail eye cream!!!!! I cannot say enough good things about this eye cream. It is so creamy and hydrating! My dehydration lines under my eyes started to go away a week after using this! My makeup goes on smooth on top of it and it prevents creasing!! This is my go-to eye creams and the only eye cream I will be using for a long long time! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nLove this eye moisture morning and night.  I have oily lids but I think keeping the area protected is so important.\\r\\nI thought this product was great overall, I wish it did a little more for lines/wrinkles, but I felt like it definitely provided moisture which is the intent of the product.\\r\\nI lovedthis stuff! I got it as a free trial once and used the entire thing within a month and a half. I like the smell and it works well for all akin types. Leaves a smooth look on your face!\\r\\nThis eye cream is perfect for before bed. I got this at Sephora and am pleased with it. It helps really moisturize around the eyes which is great especially if you already have dry skin. I would recommend this\\r\\nThe belif moisturizing eye bomb is amazing. I use it in the night time before bed and it works great it\\'s so good that I can actually use the eye bomb cream as a face moisturizer that\\'s how amazing it is.\\r\\nThis!! This eye cream is oh so moisturizing and really leaves your face feeling smooth. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too expensive but at the end of the day totally worth it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve purchased it in a sample and keep buying it. I use the eye bomb and aqua bomb everyday.\\r\\nI had a sample size of this and it lasts forever, because the eyes are such a small area on the face. It really does feel nice when it glides on.  It leaves my eyes looking a bit more nourished and young.\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I can live without this eye cream! It advertises intense moisture and elasticity. My under eyes often get dry, so I apply this day and night for a boost of moisture! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very gentle and great on my sensitive skin. I would recommend this to anyone who needs moisture for their under eye.\\r\\nI received this in a Sephora Play box and was eager to try it out because i normally love Belif\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moisturizers. This one, however, seemed to dry my eye area out after the second or third use. I kept using it in hopes to fix it but instead it kept getting worse. I do not like this product and i do not recommend it.\\r\\nFeels great around eyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super moisturizing and you get a ton of product in the jar. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll ever run out of product anytime soon. You can also use it on any areas of your face with fine lines to plump them up.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this for a few months now, and There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a lot of product. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen an eye cream this big (MEGA PLUS). It really hydrates the under eyes with a gel like texture that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too thin and not too thick. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x89\\r\\nThis has helped my under eyes immensely! My skin looks so great with these belif products! I got mine at Sephora in a little travel set and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to buy the full size ones ASAP! Definitely recommend.\\r\\nI have just started using this product and I can already see the difference in my under eye and how my makeup applies so much smoother now. This is super easy to apply and you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even need to put a lot on the face! Aka, more product for you! \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x96\\r\\nI use this every morning when I wake up as a morning and daytime moisturizer. It is one of my favorites. I find it very hydrating and absorbs into my skin fast, plus it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfilm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on my skin or leave it feeling greasy. I also find that when I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it and apply makeup on my under eyes, you can definitely tell the difference.\\r\\nI have very oily skin, with the exception of my under eyes, which are very dry. Especially after abusing my under eyes with shape tape for so long! The skin was patchy, dry, and irritated, but this saved them! My under eyes were so moisturized and this product wears wonderfully under makeup. It is a lifesaver and a must-try!\\r\\nLove this product! Got this to test out and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in love! Very moisturizing and thin! Totally recommend this!\\r\\nRich, creamy, moisturizing eye cream from the one and only belif. I haven\\'t met any moisturizer I haven\\'t lived from them...this one did not disappoint either!\\r\\nA super hydrating under eye cream that is great for those with wrinkled under eyes  This product helps to plump up those fine lines and make you look younger through hydration  I definitely recommend this product\\r\\nRefreshing burst of cool. Awakens, plumps and hydrates the under eye skin. A nice little spa moment for the under eyes. They do deserve it. Ingredients are good. Not sure if its a lasting or forever \"fix\" but it does provide an intense instant fix\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis eye cream is the only one I can use without getting those pesky white bumps. It sinks into the skin a little slowly but I actually enjoy that because the eye cream has a little cooling effect (or at least for me) that seems to help refresh my under eye\\r\\nThis is perfect for helping the under eye brighten up and look and feel moisturized. I tend to get dry patches around my eyes and I love using this to help relieve the dryness! I highly recommend this to any one, but especially people with dry skin!\\r\\nLately when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m without makeup,  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using my belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb my skin is moisturized and seems less puffy.  I enjoy that. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave me with that heavy sticky oily feeling like some others do. (I dislike moisturizers for that reason) this works really well!   I would enjoy this as a #SephoraInsider point Redemption website. Heck i would even buy it if i could afford to!\\r\\nThis feels nice and I absolutely adore the colors and packaging but, I doubt I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll buy more once this jar runs out. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice much improvement. Maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually working? I just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell at all.\\r\\nFirst time using it and I love how moisturized my eyes are after applying, It really last for a day. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in my daily regime right now!\\r\\nThis is a weightless eye moisturizer that feels so refreshing to put over my eye area. I love using this gel/cream formula right after washing my face to add immediate moisture to my eyes. I bought this from Sephora and have not been disappointed. I recommend this to all skin types. I have never been happier with an eye cream/gel. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nIt feels really moisturizing when you put it on but I felt like over time it had the opposite effect.\\r\\nBest product if your skin is dry. It helps plump upy skin and made the dryness go away. Definitely recommend.\\r\\nAbsolutely amazing! Not only does it leave my eyes feeling fresh and hydrated, it helps my under-eye makeup not crease. I use it twice a day and this has lasted me about six months (mind you, I also used a good amount for my face when I ran out of lotion).\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my current favorite. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so gentle and hydrating. This never stings my eyes, even if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re irritated. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moisturizing without feeling heavy or greasy. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t clog my pores or give me breakouts. The only downside is that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much anti-aging, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect it to (and probably is part of why it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so gentle). If I want more anti-aging, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll layer a serum under this cream.\\r\\nI apply this right before bed and it is sooo soothing! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so creamy and soft. I love the packaging, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so sleek and hold product well. The gentle formula is great for my sensitive skin. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PERFECT \\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\r\\nI\\'m a big fan of belif\\'s products. I purchased the Aqua Bomb gift set from Sephora. It is a great amount of products for the price. I\\'ve used them for months now and I\\'ve been very impressed. They are moisturizing and make my skin feel dewy and like a baby\\'s. Highly recommended.\\r\\nI really love this! It leaves my under eye area so moisturized, and isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too heavy. It also doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have too strong of a scent. I would definitely recommend!\\r\\nI use this product every night before bed, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating. Not sure I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen much of a difference in under eye lines or anything but it leaves my eye area feeling very hydrated. Would buy again.\\r\\nI loved this product so much! I often have very dry skin around my eyes so this really helped give me the hydration I needed!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nBest hydration for under your eyes great for anyone all skin type can use it. Use day & night\\r\\nI like the way this feels on my eyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too thick or watery. I feel like my eyes absorb the product well. The only thing I would say about this is that I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more a quick fix rather than long term. I have noticed long term results, but it does make puffiness go away instantly.\\r\\nIt worked pretty well. It def leaves my under eye hydrated and plumped up! I would use again.\\r\\nAccidentally purchased at Sephora, instead of the peat one. Highly enjoy, leaves eye area feeling smooth and refreshed. On the thicker/heavier side. Prefer the peat one but would still recommend to those who are looking for a thick eye cream.\\r\\nObsessed with this eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a staple in my nightly routine. Nothing works better! Couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be more impressed with the results. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little pricey, but if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for a high quality eye cream that won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t break you out, I would highly recommend!\\r\\nThis miracle gel is cooling on the skinanf adds instant hydration to your under eye area. It feels like it transforms from gel to water and gives my skin a plumpness and bounce. Bye Bye morning bags.\\r\\nThe cream has a cooling feel and works wonders. It leaves my under eye hydrated and looking fresh.\\r\\nThis product is very good I know its targeted for people who have oily skin but for me who has very dry skin it actually works I also like to mix it with the cliques prep start eye cream amazing combo\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb essential eye cream!!! Eye bomb is the BOOM! I use it everyday. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a must! Tested for 26 hrs of moisture and improve skin elasticity!\\r\\nThis product is amazing.   I have always had dark circles and very dry skin under my eyes.  I noticed that the skin under my eyes retained the moisture and my dark circles diminished.\\r\\nThis is very hydrating and cooling on my eyes. \\xc2\\xa0I use it as an extra layer on top of my night eye cream each night. \\xc2\\xa0I usually wash my face a few hours before I go to sleep, and I use this just before going to sleep on my eyes. \\xc2\\xa0I\\'m working to hydrate my eyes to reduce wrinkles, and adding this step has helped. \\xc2\\xa0My eyes look so much more alive. \\xc2\\xa0My dark circles have been minimized. \\xc2\\xa0I look like I got a better nights sleep even though my sleep habits have always been good, eyes never used to show it. \\xc2\\xa0I love it and will continue to use it.\\r\\nI love the smell of this cream. Now I personally don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have dry skin, BUT this dream is for under the eye. I get bags, dark circles, and puffiness under my eye so that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where this product comes in. Every night before bed I use under my eye and in the morning before work I use it with another under eye serum I haves. This cream definitely keeps my under eye area hydrated ! It looks moisturized, like you can tell. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great product and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll definitely continue using it.\\r\\nThis is product is better then anything else I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever tried. It smells great and leaves my under eye feeling soft. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helped with the elasticity around my eye area. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little pricey but with the money and a little goes a long way!\\r\\nit does what is says, which is to moisturize, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty much it. if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll help with puffiness or darkness, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be best to look elsewhere.\\r\\nThis is a really great eye cream that I use in the morning and at night. It has really helped the lines around my eyes soften. I can always tell the nights I skip it because I look so tired the next day.\\r\\nI love this stuff. I picked this up at Sephora while looking at eye creams. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it for a few months now and I really like it. My under eyes are more hydrated and my makeup looks so much better. I would recommend this.\\r\\nI got a sample of this in a Sephora box and I LOVE IT. My under eyes tend to get dry and this  is my favorite under eye product I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried. I will definitely be purchasing a full size soon. Highly recommend this product.\\r\\nIt is so refreshing on the eyes and nourishes the skin. It is lightweight and smells good. I used it night and day because it went perfectly under my make up as well. I would definitely recommend this to others and repurchase myself as well.\\r\\nStill drooling over this cream. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m almost out bc my baby girl thought it was lotion BUT had she not dug into it, I would still have so much! A little goes a long way. I tell everybody about this cream!\\r\\nI just received a sample of this eye cream and I am really enjoying it. I dab on a small amount and it penetrates my skin quickly leaving a well hydrated eye area. No stinging or watering of my eyes with this product. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to purchase a full size very soon.\\r\\nThis eye treatment is so moisturizing and really makes your eyes feel hydrated all day long! A bit pricy so only reason I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d mark it down! But trust me when i say a little goes a long way\\r\\nSuper moisturizing but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do a whole lot for my undereye bags. Wish it took away the redness and puffiness. I ended up using this as a moisturizer before I put on foundation. Super pricey.\\r\\nMy favorite lately. My under eyes get really dry and irritated since I have allergies and wear contacts. This helps them stay hydrated without feeling like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too heavy of a cream.\\r\\nI always recommend this eye cream. Super hydrating and works wonderful under makeup. Very hydrating and smoothing\\r\\nThis cream is great for moisturizing and the consistency is great, not too thick and easily absorbed. However, besides moisture I didn\\'t find any other benefits for my personal needs. This would be a great eye cream for a younger person to keep moisture. I\\'m 41 with dark circles (naturally). I will keep using this during dryer times of the year. \\r\\nOh my god this eye cream is good!  I got a sample at their booth at IMATS where I bought their overnight mask and sheet mask.  I have two high end eye creams currently and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it could possibly be better and it is!  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m totally buying!!\\r\\nMy favorite eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever tried. It keeps my eyes looking supple and hydrated. It also last me a long time since your only suppose to you a little for your eye area!\\r\\nTheir products for the most part work well with me. I can definitely see a difference right away and I always recommend it.\\r\\nI really liked how lightweight this product is. It goes on easily and absorbs quickly. No heavy residue! It also didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make me feel greasy or break out which I sometimes do with moisturizers.\\r\\nMy eyes are very sensitive and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take a lot to make them react/burn when trying different products, however they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t with this! this cream is so intensely hydrating, I use a generous amount at night and a small amount under makeup and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t effect how my makeup lasts in that area, highly recommend!!!\\r\\nI have very sensitive skin and this did not irritate it. This is super hydrating, great to use in the morning and at night. It sinks in quickly and does not disrupt my undereye concealer. Would definitely recommend!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m new to the eye cream game. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a believer in using great skincare so I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I needed an eye cream. Eye creams I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried in the past never made much of a difference so I just stopped using it altogether. Recently I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed my under eye area was getting dry especially when using concealer. I decided to give it another shot. Luckily I received the Belif eye cream in a Sephora play box and decided to try it since I enjoy other products from this brand. I really like this cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cooling, light yet moisturizing, and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t interfere with makeup application. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a thumbs up for me.\\r\\nBelif is an also excellent brand. I love the aqua moisture bomb, because it moisturizes my skin without it feeling greasy.  This eye cream is moisturizing but nothing special. When this is over, i will try another brand. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nThis is super moisturizing for my undereye area! I apply it before going to bed and wake up with my undereye area feeling super soft!\\r\\nI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t love the eye cream, so gave it to my mom to try. She is a huge fan and says it has reduced her puffiness. My skin is super fragile, so would recommend taking that into account.\\r\\nSo hydrating! And didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t break my sensitive skin out. Got it in my Sephora play box and loved it!\\r\\nI got this as a sample size in my last Sephora Play! Subscription box and I was really excited because Ive been wanting to use this for awhile now after reading so many great reviews. After using it, I can say i much prefer this in the morning bc its a light gel that sinks into the skin and wears well under makeup. Its great for that. But I prefer a heavier, thicker consistency eye cream at night for maximum hydration\\r\\nThe most amazing eye moisturizer ive tried in a while. Extra hudrating plus could double as a makeup eye primer. Recommended.\\r\\nI received a sample size of this through Sephora play and it is absolutely amazing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very gentle, safe for sensitive skin and super hydrating. I have very dry under eyes and I use this every morning and the Mario Badescu Olive Eye Cream at night. This combo has turned my under eye area around and has made a huge impact. A little goes a long way with this as well. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to buy the full size.\\r\\nThis product is beautiful. You get such a large amount for the price you pay and you need so LITTLE. I picked this up at Sephora unsure of what kind of results I would see, and what I\\'ve gotten are bright, hydrated eyes. I use this with an eye mask at night and look 5 years younger in the morning. This brand has impressed me and I\\'m excited to keep trying their products.\\r\\nVery cool gel consistency that is unique and unlike any other product! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as brightening as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like it to be but provides adequate moisture\\r\\nThis is the first eye cream that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make my eyes water. It keeps my under eyes nice and hydrated and soft. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help my dark circles or puffiness but it is very hydrating. Definitely worth the money and a little goes a long way\\r\\nThis product is ok in my opinion, it does what\\'s its made to do, but it\\'s nothing special really. It moisturizes  it\\'s good if you get really dry under your eye.\\r\\nThere\\'s really nothing to say about this product besides IT WORKS! It feels amazing on your skin, it isn\\'t too heavy but does have a nice rich feel to it. I use it at night and always wake up with my under-eye area looking happier and healthier.\\r\\nI love this eye cream because of how hydrating I.T is. I have kind of dry under eyes and this really gave me the moisture I need.\\r\\nI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say I see a massive difference but I use this to moisturize my under eyes before I do my make up. It does keep skin under my eyes pretty moisturized and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t disrupt my concealer.\\r\\nThis is my favorite product for hydrating my eyes while I sleep. It is the biggest sample size I\\'ve ever gotten and I am not biased based on that. But, I feel that after washing my face at night this helps put moisture back and a little does go a long way! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nAMAZING! I got this from Sephora and am OBSESSED. I have darker under-eyes and some fine lines developing. The moisture from this product is incredible and the cooling effect is really nice. I will be purchasing as soon as I run out because the results were a lighter under-eye area and less noticeable fine lines.\\r\\nHoly grail eye cream! Makes my undereyes so moisturized and less puffy. Also helps my dark circles a ton.\\r\\nSooo amazing. I\\'d use it right before i put on under eye concealer and it would make it last so much longer. It got rid of under eye circles and made me look more awake. It\\'s pricey but so worth it.\\r\\nI have really dry skin so I started using this under my eyes and on the sides of my eyes at night before bed. I wake up with hydrated and supple skin under my eyes! It doesn\\'t really have a scent but has a nice texture, not greasy. I\\'d probably buy it again.\\r\\nFirst thing I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed in this cream is its gel consistency. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very lightweight to your skin but effective for providing moisture to your eye area. It has a scent but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really hard to describe. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gentle and effective!\\r\\nI really love this eye cream! It feels very rich and moisturizing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also super affordable and I love their concept. I got a tester of this cream and used it all up so fast! Going to buy a regular size this week. Great quality!\\r\\nI think this is an amazing eye cream for day or night. It is hydrating but incredibly light, so it\\'s perfect for under makeup or as part of your evening skincare routine. My undereye area feels plump once applied, and I haven\\'t had any irritation.\\r\\nThe most hydrating eye cream \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d I recommend to anyone that suffers with dry skin. Simply amazing you won\\'t regret trying this product\\r\\nThis product is a must have!!! I will continue to repurchase this over and over! As a makeup artist, it is so versatile! I use it on any age or skin type. It sits so well under makeup and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave you looking or feeling greasy! My under eyes are extremely dry and this does wonders!\\r\\nNice light weight and extremely hydrating. When my skin needs some tlc I use it sliver my face at times\\r\\nThis felt amazing under the eyes. I loved it but unfortunately I think the skin under my eyes is too sensitive and this broke me out.\\r\\nThe belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is one of the best eye creams at this price point. My makeup goes on easily and stays on all day if I use it in the morning. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also great to use at night for all-night moisturizing. I also love the ingredient list-NO parabens or sulfates! I received this product for free from Influenster, but my opinions are my own, and I hands down recommend this product and will purchase on my own.\\r\\nThis makes the eye area look smooth and hydrated. It feels.good and not greasy. It\\'s a must have skin care routine. Try it and buy it. It is that good.\\r\\nReally hydrating and fresh smelling, it has a gel like texture and super moisturizing. Good for under concealer so it doesn\\'t look dry and patchy especially.\\r\\nThis is a great eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hydrating and smooths and depuffs nicely. I did not notice a noticeable improvement in my dark circles though. It looks very nice under makeup and I will continue to use it!\\r\\nI got a sample of this in a beauty subscription bag. It is light blue in color, and has the consistency of a moisturizer. It has a slight cooling effect, and tingled a little when applied (not too much though). I noticed a small difference in the puffiness under my eyes, but this did nothing for the dark circles. It cured the dryness under my eyes though. Overall it was semi-effective for me. I\\'m not sure the price point is worth it for me.\\r\\nI got this a couple weeks ago and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my first eye cream ever! It smells so good and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my skin and soaks into my skin so well. I love the way it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absorbed and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so refreshing too! Will definitely repurchase\\r\\nReally nice, deeply moisturizing (but gentle) product. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for nighttime use and really helps my undereye bags. A bit greasy for daytime wear under makeup (which is expected for a product like this) but so far I really like it!\\r\\nI got a sample of this in a Sephora play box and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it for about a week. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m noticing immediate differences from my last eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a nice thick gel texture. If you have by kind of dryness under your eyes this will take care of it right away! It also works beautifully under make up. A little goes a long way!\\r\\n#1 in Eye Cream\\'s, it deserves that title! I recently\\xc2\\xa0ran into Belief products, and I am so happy that I did. The value of it is great. I read & watched so many reviews, then I tried it! I got mine at Sephora, and I would recommend this to others! I live in a dry dry state so this was def a must have this winter. I can\\'t wait to see how it holds up this summer! I will be buying this again, if you are on the fence, go to your local Sephora\\xc2\\xa0(or anywhere else that sells this and gives you free samples) and try some, if you are on the fence.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis eye cream is super moisturizing and makes your under eyes really plump and glowy!\\r\\nMy most favorite eye cream of all! I received it in one of Sephora Play Boxes and immediately put it into use. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very light and moisturizes my eye area very well. I truly love how it feels on my skin. Once I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m done with my deluxe sample, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m definitely buying a full-sized one!\\r\\nThis wonderful little guy is so hydrating and lightweight under my eyes, I love its water gel consistency similar to Neutrogena Hydro Boost moisturizer. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as heavy as Kiehl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s creamy eye treatment either so that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a plus as well!\\r\\nI WILL CONTINUE TO BUY THIS TILL THE END OF TIME!!!!! The only eye cream I have ever used where I 100% notice a difference. Not only does it immediately hydrate so nicely, but it also plumps up my under eye. I use this morning and night and cannot get over how much it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helping me!\\r\\nThe most moisturizing balm. Not all skincare suits everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skin texture but this worked fine on me. Never too greasy and was moisturizing. Loved how my skin felt after using them\\r\\nVery hydrating cream and not too greasy. I just didn\\'t see anything particularly different about this eye cream but I did like it! I need to keep trying it.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI received this as a sample in a sephora play box and I really like it. It is really moisturizing under my eyes. I only use it at night because it does feel a little thick, but it does a great job. Will buy again.\\r\\nI love this product. I was weary about eye creams and kinda in denial about needed them but I truly notice a different with this product. It is definitely worth checking out! Belif products are underrated and really awesome.\\r\\nI ran out of this product but it does really does help my dry under eyes become more moisturized. Good for underneath makeup as well.\\r\\nThis is my favorite product I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried from this company! I use it every morning and a little goes a long way. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super moisturizing and I feel like my under eye make up stays on better after using!\\r\\nThis eye bomb is magnificent! I got it in a VoxBox and before using it I had major eye bags and since using it they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as noticeable which I love. The packaging is simple but cute and sturdy, I love that it seems like a small jar but it last forever since you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need a lot of product!\\r\\nI got a sample of this in my monthly Sephora playbox and love it so far. While it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t some magical eye cream that will rid you of all wrinkles, it is a nice layer of hydration for your sensitive eye area. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my eyes at all and works very well under make up!\\r\\nThis stuff felt nice and cool under my eyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as effective but just nice to keep under eyes moisturized. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty pricey for something that just hydrates so maybe stick to a moisturizer instead but if you want to blow money hey this is your product.\\r\\nLove this for when my under eye area is dry. It really sinks in and moisturizes. It also helps with my makeup application and prevents too much creasing with my foundation.\\r\\nyes, it\\'s expensive but worth it. I have pretty dry skin and this smooths my under-eyes out like no other cream. It\\'s also pretty lightweight, it sinks in quickly and just leaves this nice softness. Can\\'t say it does much for pigmentation/wrinkles yet but it\\'s definitely moisturizing so I will continue using it!\\r\\n5 star product!!! This eye cream is the most moisturizing cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used. Water bomb is the perfect name for this cream because it relieves dry under eyes like no other. I love the gel like texture it has as well. Great for pre makeup application, just make sure to give it time to dry down!\\r\\nThis is my favorite eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so moisturizing but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave my under eyes looking greasy. I feel like my skin immediately absorbs it and my under eyes would be left moisturized the whole day. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightweight that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t affect my makeup when I do put makeup on top. Would totally recommend\\r\\nThis is by far the best eye cream that I have ever tried. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so moisturizing without being to heavy! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so easy to use and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pull on your sensitive eyelids and under eye area. I use this daily! Love love love!\\r\\nYet another wonderful eye balm that works. I suggest using it before bed. Kind of pricey but if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re willing to spend a little extra it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that bad. Available at Sephora\\r\\nI received this product via Influenster and Benefit Voxbox and fell completely in love! This is the perfect serum for under your eyes to give you that dewy glow. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using for a month now and can tell such a difference, I will definitely be buying more this product!\\r\\nKeeps eyes refreshed and moisturized!  I use this every morning and evening and what a eye cream this is \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8a\\r\\nIf your skin really wants a quench, add this to your skincare routine! I was looking for something to hydrate and plump my under eyes and this product does the trick. I have issues with darkness because ive gone without properly moisturizing my under eyes for so long, but since using this product I can really see a difference. Pat on instead of rubbing in and also store this in the refrigerator for an instant depuffing agent!\\xc2\\xa0 \\r\\nThis eye cream is amazing! It has a lightweight feel that feels like water when being blended out on the skin and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great to wear under make up or in hot weather as you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel a thick layer melting on your skin! It is not oily at all and it has worked so well on lessening the appearance of my fine lines!\\r\\nI like this product, but i put 4 stars because i would like to feel more hydration in my under eye area, but its a pretty good product. I have a sample of this product.\\r\\nI usually use this underneath another eye cream, but this is such a light yet effective product. I just started using this product a couple months ago from Ipsy gen beauty and I already love it. I definitely thing I would purchase it again. The main up side to this is that it feels like nothing is on your skin so you can add additional product without your face feeling too heavy.\\r\\nGreat gel cream for my eye area. Lightweight gel formula, smells and feels refreshing and cool, leaves the skin around my eyes feeling energized and supple.\\r\\nI have sensitive eyes and this doesn\\'t irritate them.  It looks like its working. It doesn\\'t feel like I\\'m wearing anything. I would recommend this.\\r\\ni\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a big fan of belif products, it feels lightweight on my skin and leaves my eyes looks refreshed and the skin smooth and firm. i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given this 4/5 as i don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as effective as my other eye cream but it is still a great product. smells good too!\\r\\nThis product is so good!! Keeps my under eyes super moisturized! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve purchased this a few times from Ulta! Total life saver! Would definitely recommend this to anyone with under dry under eyes! Not the most impressive packaging, but worth every dollar in my book!\\r\\nThis under eye cream is really nice and has a very creamy formula and works for it\\'s purpose. However, it is quite expensive and I feel as if there are other less expensive options to choose from. It is very hydrating but again there are less expensive eye creams out there.\\r\\nGot this in the March Sephora playbox, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in love with it. It keeps the skin around my eyes moisturizes and peppy, and makes me curious about trying the belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb to see if that is just as amazing for my face.\\r\\nThis eye bomb is not for brightening or for waking up the under eye, but for giving it that extra moisture! I have a somewhat dry under eye and sometimes my concealer looks a little dry and this really helps! A little goes a very long way with this stuff too which is awesome! This is my first product with this brand and I am impressed! I believe I will purchase again! These are my own opinions given to me by my personal experience with the product!\\r\\nI use this product every night. The texture is great, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not greasy or oily! And it really moisturizes well.\\r\\nOmg LOVE!!!!! I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say enough good about this product. I use it in the morning after washing my face and before applying makeup. It has a cooling effect that makes your eyes feel more awake. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t to thick or thin. It glides on easily with zero tugging at the eyes but it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t greasy at all. It soaks into the skin and leaves your eye skin perfectly ready for makeup. It is wonderful!!!\\r\\nI love belif products! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried this one and the moisturizing bomb! So hydrating to the face! I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get enough of the brand! I would recommend this to EVERYONE!\\r\\nI really wanted to like this product after swatching it on my wrist. It\\'s very rich and moisturizing and seems like it\\'ll do a great job and erasing those pesky crows feet. BUT, I have extremely sensitive eyes and most eye creams irritate my eyes causing them to water throughout the day. This product was no exception which is a shame because I think I really could\\'ve liked it.\\r\\nLets start by saying ...WOW!!!!! BOMBS AWAY! I have recently lost over 50lbs and the skin on my face is obviously less supple. I seriously started to see the wrinkles attack my face instantly. So I went to war!!! I bought the \"BOMB\". I loved how it instantly sinks right into my skin and goes to work. I can apply makeup with in a couple of minutes and the best part is there is no sticky residue.\\xc2\\xa0 I use this twice a day and within a couple of days I started to see a big difference. A coworker even told me that I looked more awake. The lines have started to lessen. HOOORAYY!!!!!I am now passed the sample stage and have purchased a full sized bottle. I cant imagine using anything else on my eyes. I may actually be ready to become a full blown Belif user.\\xc2\\xa0Product is not cheap but not terribly expensive. I just wish I had a before and after photo.\\r\\nI have been seeing subtle improvements in my dark circles and the product helps with improving the firmness of my undereyes. I love that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a strong scent and quickly absorbs, so no residue!\\r\\nBeware if you have very sensitive skin. Something in this irritates my skin. It made me puffy and red. It does smell good and is probably great if you aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sensitive. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also pretty expensive compared to other mid range brands.\\r\\nThe only thing I dislike about this product is the price, other than that I have found my holy grail eye cream. I am not allowed to use heavy emollient eye creams because I will get milia under my eyes. I have to use gel based eye creams if I dont want milia to reappear and this works soooo good. Its moisturizing, does not sting the eyes, soothing, helps concealer not look cakey. A little goes a long way. It smells like herbs to me which I enjoy, I feel like I am at a spa when I put this on. \\r\\nKeeping your eyes hydrated is key to fight aging and this product does that fast drying put on day and night for amazingly hydrated awake eyes to keep the fight on Aging\\r\\nThis eye cream is so refreshing, especially after a long flight. I have extremely dry under eyes and I feel as though this brings me back to life. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extremely cooling, gentle and does everything you want an eye cream to do and more. Highly recommend.\\r\\nThe best skin care brand out there! This make my under eyes look flawless. Worth every penny!\\r\\nThis eye cream is so good. It is such a good cream/moisturizer I use it for my whole face lol. My mom got it and I stole it but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll definitely be buying another one when I run out. I 100% recommend. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my favorite!\\r\\nThe best product I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever received from influenster. It makes my under eye feel so smooth, perfect and hydrated. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m obsessed and will for sure buy again.\\r\\nI really enjoyed this belif product for moisturizing under my eyes. It doesn\\'t settle into my fine lines and when I apply it at night, I wake up with a well hydrated eye area! The nice thing about this cream is that is isn\\'t heavy and feels light when applying it. Overall one of the better eye creams on the market, especially given its price!\\r\\nAbsorbs super quick. light and does not look greasy or oily after applying. effective for people having dry skin under eyes.\\r\\nGot a sample of this in my Sephora box and love it! It smells great and works really fast and well!\\r\\nI received this as a sample in my Sephora play box and I was so impressed on how moisturized my eyes felt! It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel greasy or sink into my laugh lines. I sometimes put it on my dry patches on other parts of my face. I was blown away on how great this moisturizer worked and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll definitely be purchasing the full size!!\\r\\nThis eye cream is silky and smooth. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure how much it really worked but it made me feel like I was doing something right. Make sure to wait until it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dry before applying makeup or you will see creasing under your eye.\\r\\nPretty solid eye cream. I use it before applying make up and it is super hydrating and absorbs well. Doesn\\'t pill. I don\\'t see any difference in wrinkles or puffiness but it\\'s a nice extra layer for moisturizing your eye area. Would purchase again.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis eye cream is great. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very light and moisturizing! My eyelids get very dry and this really helps them! I would definitely recommend this.\\r\\nI have a very.... VERY dry eye area. This was already a problem, before products that irritated it more, then Chicago winters. This product doesn\\'t really get rid of my fine lines (but to be fair I have yet to find any products that really do.... I rubbed my eyes a lot very vigorously as a kid).That all being said, it is WONDERFUL at moisturizing. Within two nights of using it, my eyes went from being flaky and itchy and in pain to comfortable. Two weeks more and they actually became supple. Supple! It says moisturizing bomb and it MEANS it!I\\'m giving it 4 stars because I simply don\\'t see it repairing fine lines or helping elasticity. If it weren\\'t making those claims it would instantly be 5 stars from me because it\\'s an\\xc2\\xa0absolute miracle worker for severe dryness!\\r\\nGot this in my Sephora PLAY and I love it! It\\'s very hydrating and help with those really dry says when I have flaky skin. I do have to layer it on those really dry days but it does the job\\r\\nA very lightweight, ultra-absorbent eye cream that has made a visible difference in reducing and preventing under eye circles. It has a nice cooling effect and I can feel after-effects if it working for hours after I put it on. This product is the bomb, indeed!\\r\\nA hidden gem. Helps moisturize The delicate eye area. Light yet provides moisture to boost elasticity. Good as a primer. Good packaging. Natural ingredients\\r\\nThis is my new absolute favorite eye cream! I use this when I wake up in the morning for under my eyes to prevent premature aging and kind of hide my dark circles. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if it is just a coincidence, but my eyes have never looked more bright and refreshed (even when I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a TON of sleep). I have noticed they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as dry as they were before as well.\\r\\nWhen I first tried this, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like it. I honestly left it in my drawers for awhile. Then one day, I woke up and had these extremely dry patches of skin around my eyes that felt extremely tight. It was the most uncomfortable feeling, so I wanted to find something that was really going to moisturize that area. I pulled this bad boy back out and it really saved me! The skin around my eyes felt so hydrated and now I use it every morning! It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really do anything else for me but because my eyes are so dry, I have to use this very often.\\r\\nGot this complimentary from Influenster, I love this eye bomb, I love how creamy it is. I feel when I use this before my makeup routine my eyes do feel a bit more moisturized through the day.\\r\\nThis is the best eye cream that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used so far. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thick, very moisturizing and i feel my ender eye very soft when i wake up next day. Bought it from sephora after using other day cream from the brand.\\r\\nI wasn\\'t a big fan of this product. While it felt okay on my face it made my eyes very itchy. But I\\'m usually not very dry under my eyes so not sure if that had something to do with it. I received this product for testing purposes complimentary from Influenster.\\r\\nGreat eye cream! Was extremely hydrating amd didn\\'t cause breakouts. I used it in my entire face during winter months in the desert.\\r\\nAbsolutely the best eye cream in the market. A little goes a long way and this can last you for at least three months. The product is super moisturizing and it is totally worth the price.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nLove the belif brand. I got a sample of the moisturizing eye cream in my Sephora play box and just started using it. When first applied it feels cool. It has just the right amount of moisture. Not to think not to thin. I apply mine at night before bed. The smell is not bothersome to me. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kinda citrusy. I will purchase a full size soon. And would recommend to family and friends.\\r\\nMy FAVORITE eye cream ever. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s initially too thick for my personal liking but it really gets deep into my skin and gives it amazing moisture. I have bags, dark circles & veins & it reduces all of that. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great under makeup as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not greasy or thick.\\r\\nI use this product every single day! The consistency of the lotion is so thick, and feels great going on! Absolutely love it.\\r\\nLove using this so that my under eyes dont crease throughout the day. Love this product for that reason. Five stars.\\r\\nI love using this moisturizing eye bomb as a base before applying my makeup. Concealer and color corrector glides on super smooth on top of this and somehow it helps with creasing too. I also like how light it feels.\\r\\nI received this in my Sephora\\'s play box and I couldn\\'t be happier. I\\'ve always wanted to try Belif skincare. The name says it all, the cream is very lightweight and hydrating. 5 stars!\\r\\nIt certainly is moisturizing like its name states. No scent and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my eye area which is great! The price tag is a little steep in my opinion but I got it as a gift so I learn to really cherish It\\r\\nFeels cooling and nice, not sticky or greasy. I received a sample of it in my Sephora box.. not sure if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to purchase it yet.\\r\\nExcelent product! This eye cream is very moisturizing and smells really fresh! I have over a month using it and my under eyes looks so well!\\r\\nI have very dry skin, especially under my eyes. With regular moisturizers, my dry under-eye area only becomes visible if I set under my eyes with powder, but when I used this bomb, that went away entirely. Days when I wasnt wearing makeup, it made my eyes look less tired! This product will definitely become a regular part of my routine.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nReally great for sensitive eyes, I never feel a burning sensation on the thin skin around my eyes like I have with other creams. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still not sure if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen results with it yet, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy to keep using.\\r\\nThis has becoming my every night eye cream. It feels very light but works heavy duty. I don\\'t like using it before applying makeup though, I have issues with it balling up if I try to blend anything over the cream. IMO it is best used by itself\\r\\nPERFECT! I used to never use eye creams but I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go a day without using this before applying makeup. It just brightens the area overall and makes me feel more awake\\r\\nThis product is so soft with my eye skin, the consistency is so easy to apply and you just need a little bit.\\r\\nA great lightweight eye cream for every day use. This is perfect for every day wear due to how light it sits on my face. Not greasy or heavy at all! Most eye creams are too heavy and cause millia, this one sits fabulously and is great.\\r\\nI needed an eye cream because of my dry under eyes causing tarte shape tape to crease and look heavy. This is a great choice because it is light but very gel like almost. It does a great job but there are no anti aging benefits to it\\r\\nI usually don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use things like this. I liked it I thought it was nice and hydrating. I got this item free for testing purposes. I want to use it longer to see results but so far so good ! I would recommend to a friend.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI\\'m obsessed! I love how rich and creamy this product is. It\\'s super effective and you only need a little amount! Incredibly moisturizing and always makes me feel de-puffed and ready for the day. Will absolutely buy again.\\r\\nThis is my new favorite nighttime eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heavy enough to moisturize but light enough to keep the milia away. I use a spatula to get the product out of the jar but wish this came in a tube. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightweight enough for that and would be much cleaner.\\r\\nI liked this product.it came with sephora play box. I used everynight before sleeping.when i wake up my under eye is so smooth.but price is little bit expensive\\r\\nI love the thickness of the product and it does moisturize under my eyes. It doesn\\'t do much for the discoloration which is what I\\'m looking for\\r\\nLove how hydrating this eye cream is! It instantly refreshes my tired eyes and makes me look more awake. I love using it before I apply my makeup, my concealer glides on more smoothly. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen a big difference on improving my dark circles but definitely improves dryness.\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It is so nice and does help moisturize my under eye area. It does help reduce fine lines and smooths the skin. It applies nicely and absorbs quickly into the skin. I highly recommend this product.\\r\\nto accurately rate this eye cream, I have to be clear on what I look for in an eye cream. personally, I like an eye cream to reduce swelling & moisturize. although I have to admit I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen a change in my under eyes swelling, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible for a product to moisturize my under eyes more than this does. I apply it in the morning, & when I wash my face at night I can still feel the product on my eyes. if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for a moisturizer for your under eyes, look no further!\\r\\nSuper moisturizing. Thick. A little goes a long way. Thanks Sephora. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it every night.\\r\\nThis feels so nice on the under eye. It\\'s light weight so it sinks in quickly and doesn\\'t leave any sort of residue, but it\\'s ultra hydrating and plumping! My concealer started looking better and less cakey after I started using this in the mornings.\\r\\nPerfect texture gel sort of creamy, light texture doesn\\'t feel greasy but glides on easily love putting this on\\r\\nI got a small sample of this from Sephora, and it seems OK. It\\'s moisturizing, which is my main concern for my undereye area, but I haven\\'t noticed any other differences in my skin, like the elasticity, which it claims to improve. I still need to apply this often, though it claims to moisturize for 26 hours, the skin under my eyes requires more moisture the next morning so I have to reapply. I\\'m not wow-ed by it, but I am glad I have the sample and will continue to use it until it\\'s gone. I\\'m still in search of an eye cream that really blows my mind, and I was hoping this would be the one. It\\'s good, but not holy grail.\\r\\nThis product is as amazing... its smells pretty great and the finish really leaves your skin soft and hydrated.\\r\\nIt\\'s a good eye gel not really a cream. Really hydrating under the eyes. Not at all sticky or thick; just a refreshing, lightly scented gel.\\r\\nTalk about a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfine line eliminator!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I received a small sample from Sephora and this product is truly amazing; hydration and crows feet blaster at it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pure finest. I saw results within a week of utilizing my small sample up. I will be purchasing this product and incorporating it in my daily skin care routine.\\r\\nI  L O V E this brand! I have been using this cream recently and is my go to! This brand is a huge deal right now... I have dry skin and this is awesome !\\r\\nI LOVE this super hydrating eye balm. I\\'ve been testing out a sample fore a few days now, and I truly notice a difference. My under eyes are a lot more hydrated these colder months and I\\'m enjoying the results\\r\\nLoveddd this stuff- huge container and hydrated so well. I would definitely recommend this if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the market for a new eye cream! I received this product for complimentary purposes and all opinions are my own.\\r\\nCurrently using this. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m digging it! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great moisturizer. Keeps my bags at bay and offers the perfect amount of moisture for my under eye area. I also apply it above my eye brow as I tend to get dry there and it has combatted this greatly!\\r\\nlove this product! super moisturizing and I like that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a scent. perfect for sensitive skin.\\r\\nBelif has been my favorites skin care for eye creams! I truly have fell in love with this one! I see a difference right away and mostly with my makeup. I used to always have a crease going on with my makeup and ever since I use this under my under eyes look amazing! I recommend it\\r\\nSo so so moisturizing!  It has no scent which is perfect.  It does not irritate my eyes.  I have seen a decrease in puffiness after use.\\r\\nVery lightweight, yet moisturizing. I can see using this on my whole face in the summertime as a general moisturizer. I could do with a little less fragrance, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just personal preference.\\r\\nVery average, packaging is nice, nice scent. Feels lightweight on the skin. As to results, I might not be the right target for this product.\\r\\nI really like this eye cream! I\\'m a huge fan of Belif, so when I first got a sample of the moisturizing eye bomb, I was really excited! It\\'s a bit less thick than I had imagined (not that that\\'s necessarily a bad thing) so it definitely works well during both the day, and at night. I happen to prefer a fairly thick eye cream at night, so I tend to use this during the day, where it works great! A little goes a long way, it goes on smoothly, and absorbs quickly, so it\\'s a great base before eye makeup. The price tag for the full size is $48, which is a bit steep, but at least you get a very large amount for the price, so it\\'ll last a good while. The mini sample I got in a sephora kit a while back lasted me months! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good all-purpose eye cream!\\r\\nSuper moisturizing and non greasy! I love everything about this line and the eye cream is no different. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect for applying underneath your concealer to prevent dryness and crackling I was surprised because it came in a much smaller container than the moisturizing bomb but I think this stuff is going to last me awhile. Perfect for the winter!\\r\\nReceived a sample of this in my Sephora play box. So far so good! I\\'ve been using it nightly for a couple of weeks. Does a great job at hydrating under my eyes and soaks in nicely. It has a nice creamy/gel texture and feels luxurious under the eyes. Nice and fresh scent. I\\'m anxious to see more long term effects but for now I\\'m enjoying as is! Would purchase full size.\\r\\nI love this eye cream! I put it on at night before bed and it adds so much brightness and hydration to my eyes and you can tell the difference when I wake up in the morning! I have actually gotten compliments on how bright my eyes are after using this eye cream. The texture of it blends into my skin like water\\r\\nLOVE this product. A little goes a long way. I use it at night as a part of my night routine after serums. It feels super moisturizing, great product.\\r\\nThis eye moisturizer helps plump up my fine lines and keep my eye area hydrated. I love it!\\r\\nPurchased this eye cream about two weeks ago from Sephora and have been loving it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in my late twenties and was looking for elasticity and hydration. This claims hydration up to 26 hours and creates a base for Concealer. This has helped my under eye concealer appear smooth even after setting with a powder my under eye has not been feeling as dry. There is hardly any scent to this and the packaging is a nice blue. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for deep hydration for their under eye.\\r\\nThis is a amazing product it is super hydrating and moisturizing it feels like your skin has drank a tall glass of water I highly recommend this product you need to try it for yourself\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in my 30\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so dry under eyes and aging is a concern of mine of course. This cream works wonderfully to keep under eyes hydrated, and in the process keeps makeup in that area looking flawless. However, I noticed one of the ingredients is silicone so I only use from time to time for that reason. I will tolerate some silicones in my foundation, but I try to stay away from it in my skin care.  This may be why some people say they had issues with it causing bumps around the eye area.\\r\\nI use this as a night time eye cream and it works very well. I use it both underneath my eyes and on my lids. It leaves my under eye looking hydrated and refreshed.\\r\\nI received this in a Sephora Play! Bag, and the small sample lasted about 1 month. This eye cream was slick and absorbed quickly into my skin. It was comfortable and lightweight and my makeup looked pretty good on top. My skin is very dry and my concealer does crease even with this eye cream which is normal for me. I do think there might be an increase in texture under my eye since starting use but now that it\\'s gone I\\'ll see if there is a change. The eye cream didn\\'t cause any milia. For the price I\\'m not sure it\\'s worth it as I didn\\'t see any reduction in fine lines. But if you want to try it it\\'s a nice option. I prefer the Algenist eye balm over this though.\\r\\nI received this in one of my sephora play\\'s bag and have been using it since. Even though this product is not on the cheap side but I would like to buy the actual product in the future. It doesn\\'t have a fragrance and the texture is silky so this is safe to use on any type of skin in my view. I have naturally puffy eyes and I have noticed a difference after using this almost daily.\\r\\nI just love this stuff, the smell, the texture/consistency and I do see a difference with my under eyes in regards to hydration\\r\\nI love this eye cream so much! I appreciate that this product delivers on its\\' promises stated on the packaging that is moisturizing properties. The consistency is gel like but it relatively quickly absorbs into the skin. It does not leave any residue or a glistening effect. So no need to rub it in after the initial application. The skin feels smooth and supple. I can freely move my fave and not feel any tightening, or having wrinkles forms.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI got a sample of this product in a subscription box. I\\'ve been using it nightly before bed,  and I\\'ve noticed a big difference in my under eye area. I have less fine lines & discoloration since using it. I really like this company\\'s products!\\r\\nJust what it says...BOMB of moisture. A little goes a long way. This will last a long time\\r\\nMy under eye area is desperately dry. After receiving this as a sample and using morning and night, the results are incredible! I no longer struggle with that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cscaly\\xe2\\x80\\x9d look of dried concealer and feel confident that the moisture will last all day. Belif makes incredible products!\\r\\nI love this! I truly have noticed a difference after using this for the past few months. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to apply, one jar lasts forever and it keeps my eyes moisturized and the fine lines away. 10/10 recommend.\\r\\nSo moisturizing! I always used the kiehls and this gives it a run for its money! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very lightweight and there is a decent amount of product in the container\\r\\nAMAZING doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even begin to cover how I feel with this on. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been going out with no foundation or concealer and just a few dabs of the moisturizing eye bomb ever morning.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never used a eye cream before and when I tried this one I was blown away it was just so hydrating and refreshing under the eye! Highly recommend!!\\r\\nI really love this product. I received it in a Belif Traveling kit as a small, travel size and was so sad when it ran out. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t found another more hydrating eye cream out there, so this will be my staple unless something better comes along.\\r\\nFantastic product. It smells and feels amazing, both in the package and on your skin. I have a very delicate and sensitive eye area and this is one of my favorite products ever. It feels cool and soothing when applied and I just love it. Five stars all day!\\r\\nThis is truly a moisturizing bomb. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thick and creamy, and goes on in a thick layer. It smells nice, and is very hydrating. It states that you can wear it under makeup, but I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t found that to be the case. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much better if you use it at night in your nighttime skincare routine.\\r\\nI am only 24, but my under eyes are so dry, and I have one pretty deep line. This is the only eye cream that has helped with that dryness (immediately and over time), and has helped to soften that line when being worn. It works great in conjunction with my foundation and concealer.\\r\\nI used this for about a week and it cause a bubble under my eye. Too much moisture for my skin\\r\\nBought this because it was so highly reviewed on Sephora and I was not disappointed. I\\'ve been using it about 3 months now and have noticed a difference in my fine lines. My eyelids look more plump and feel calmer after I use this. I layer a sunscreen on top of it for day wear. It smells wonderful too - almost like a blend of jasmine and citrus. Feels like an aromatherapy experience whenever I use it.\\r\\nCan i rate this 10 stars?? Wow i got this as a sample packet from sephora. The packet has .10mL of product and it has lasted me three weeks with everyday use. This eye cream is actually the best ive ever tried. It does not make my sensitive eyes burn, it smells very natural almost herbal, the hydration level is unreal! Where was this all my life. I was so shocked at the results i went out and bought it!\\r\\nIt definitely did what it said it would do. Moisturized my undereye. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take away any dark circles or puffiness that I noticed but I do like the smell and the refreshing feel of it!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on the fence on this product. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely moisturizing but I feel like it makes my under eyes appear more puffy then they usually are!? If I were you I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d grab a sample before purchasing the full size!\\r\\nI really like this eye cream. It\\'s somewhere between a gel and a cream, which makes it versatile enough for anyone to use. I use it every day and night and don\\'t need to use much product to cover my eye area. It has a very pleasant light scent and is gentle enough for sensitive skin. It also comes with a decent amount of product. Only downside is the packaging seems a little bulky for the amount of product inside. Not a huge problem for me, but just an observation. I would highly recommend this product; it\\'s totally worth it.\\r\\nThis is currently my favorite eye cream. It is super moisturizing. I use it day and night and enjoy it. I received it as a sample and will purchase a full-size.\\r\\nI received a sample from Sephora and was super surprised by the density of this eye cream. I usually use Lush\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Enchanted eye cream, which is light, soothing, and the only eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen any difference with. Due to the richness of the Belif I was skeptical I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d see the same results that people seem to see; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been surprised. This works well for taking down some puffiness from allergies, is helping with my baby crow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feet, and sinks into my skin quickly without being sticky. However, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been particularly sleep-deprived the past few days and have really pronounced bags under my eyes and I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen a big difference in effectiveness. Overall it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good product but would love to see results in longer usage.\\r\\nI am in love with eye cream! I have started to use it in my everyday routine. I still have my full size sample that was sent to me and it last for a while! I 100% recommend this product, it noticeably feel and a difference in my eyes!\\r\\nLOVE THIS! I got it free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is a great product! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still using it in my nightly routine! My only negative thought about this product (that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve also mentioned in other reviews) is that I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t love sticking my fingers into the pot to get product. Even though my hands are clean it just doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel super sanitary. Other than that I love this product! Thank god i have a full size pot though because it is a little expensive!\\r\\nI am currently using this eye cream as a sample received in my Sephora play box. I love it but I do not see myself purchasing. It is very hydrating yes but does nothing for fine lines and wrinkles, bye bye under eye does it all\\r\\nI absolutely love this product! Super moisturizing and it does what it claims to do! Definitely a must have!!!\\r\\nI love this eye cream! I have super sensitive skin that can be dry at times. This cream doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a strong scent and is thick but absorbs into the skin very nicely. It held the hydration through my stressful long shift at the hospital. I feel it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helped slightly with my dark circles too! I will continue to use this! :D\\r\\nHOLY GRAIL EYE CREAM. This stuff is seriously the best. I first discovered the aqua bomb moisturizer through a sephora sample and fell in love. Wanting to try more from the brand but being a 20 something and fully convinced I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need an eye cream yet, I put my faith in the brand and discovered that my eyes had been missing out! So moisturizing and has helped fine lines I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even realize I had.\\r\\nI got this in a Sephora play box and I was surprised how much I like it. It does moisturize well and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t not irritate or burn my eyes.\\r\\nLOVE LOVE LOVE this eye cream! Belif was not playing around with this eye bomb. It comes packing with tons of moisture that had immediate results. I\\'ve already bought my second batch! Truly heaven in a bottle!\\r\\nLoved this eye cream!! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so lightweight but so hydrating. Everyone needs to try this. It makes my under eyes look so smooth and firm!\\r\\nI really like this eye cream and the whole belif brand. It\\'s super moisturizing and feels lovely on the skin. Would definitely recommend.\\r\\nLove this stuff. Light gel like texture but highly moisturizing, goes on smooth and feels great\\r\\nA substantive cream that really makes my eye area feel bathed in moisture.\\xc2\\xa0 Am always tempted just to use this on my entire face... but the face cream is great too!\\r\\nAmazing. Keeps my under eyes hydrated and refreshed. A lot going a long way. I definitely recommend. Packing is amazing and luxe. Buy it! You definitely won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t regret it. Thanks Influenster for sending it\\r\\nAlmost feels balmy in texture instead of creamy. Seems to work well on my fine lines and a little goes a long way.\\r\\nI absolutely love all of belifs products. This eye cream was amazing! Smooth and weightless\\r\\nI got this in my Sephora Play bag last month and have been trying it out. Its a little too soon to see full results but i have noticed my eye lids are a little less hooded. We shall see!\\r\\nThis is a super light gel like formula. It goes on super smooth, the eye area really absorbs it quickly. Almost like a cup of water for your under eyes. Worked really well under makeup. A definite must try for great hydration.\\r\\nI have two sample sizes of these because I love it so much but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to spend the money on the full size. This has reduced the baggies and dryness under my eyes and makes makeup application look so much better.\\r\\nThis product had such good reviews on Sephora\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website and I was so excited to try my sample. It was a let down. I found that it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much in the way of hydration and that the product balled up on my skin. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t what I was expecting from this brand.\\r\\nThis eye cream is great. I love the medium thickness and it absorbs so well underneath the eye. I felt like it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t affect my makeup at all, which is a huge plus.\\r\\nNot sure if it is supposed to help with the appearance of wrinkles or not, but it is very hydrating and soothing!\\r\\nThis stuff is amazing! I have used a few different  brands but this really does work. At night the skin under my eyes gets to tight after I wash my face. All I need is a little dab of this and my skin feels amazing! Like I said, Amazing!!\\r\\nWhile this is a very nice eye cream, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not something I would go out of my way to repurchase. I only use it at night because it makes my eye makeup ball up\\r\\nOne of the best moisturizing eye creams I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used! It is so light weight, sinks into the skin incredibly quickly because of its gel texture, and leaves my under eyes looking plump and hydrated! Would definitely buy again!\\r\\nMy absolute favorite works amazing on the eyes a bit pricey but last a long time very gentle\\r\\nI have been using this product for a bit now. I received it from Influenster. I am still using it. I only use it at night, maybe if I use it in the morning too I would see better results. But even with just night time. My undereyes usually feel hydrated! Love it!\\r\\nThis stuff is unbelievably moisturizing and although entirely unrelated to the efficacy of the product, I love that shade of blue on the container. It has a lightweight formula that applies smoothly, absorbs easily, and isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritating to my eyes. My main concern at the moment is hydration/moisturizing properties and less with fine lines (the rock climbing staff refused to believe that I graduated college almost a decade ago), so this definitely does the trick for me! This eye cream is also free of synthetic fragrances/dyes, and the brand is cruelty-free! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m docking a star only because of affordability (I wish it were cheaper!).\\r\\nI really love this eye cream! It\\'s the perfect amount of moisturization while being the right consistency to apply. It doesn\\'t have a heavy scent at all, which is fabulous, and it is very gentle to the skin. Even though it is a bit pricey, it lasts what feels like forever! I only need a tiny bit to apply and my skin feels so smooth and fresh. I think this cream is really best served as being worn to bed since it can be hard to have makeup stay on top of it. Definitely worth the money and one of the best eye creams I have tried!\\r\\nSmells amazing and feels hydrating. However, it definitely burned the under eye area of my skin which is unusual for me because my skin is never that reactive like that\\r\\nI really like the moisture it provides. It really helps when you\\'re trying to bake and finish your powders. Makes application a snap\\r\\nAwesome product!! I actually ended up repurchasing this after I finished the one that was sent to me! I will likely continue to repurchase this unless I find something better. Only thing I would change is the packaging.\\r\\nThis is one of my fav skincare products. I keep it in the fridge and it works great to depuff my eyes in the morning. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also super soothing to put on after scrubbing off heavy eye makeup. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lasting me a while since you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to use much\\r\\nGreat product! Definitely recommend. Pricey but worth it! Leaves skin hydrated & soft\\r\\nGreat product....would definitely highly recommend to others....great price. Love love love!\\r\\nThis cream gives moisture And refresh the eyes area, but if feel sticky and I don\\'t like it. Is going to use it in the morning before the eye makeup.\\r\\nI absolutely love this eye cream! Belif is such a great brand, and their eye cream works so well with their other moisturizers. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard for me to find an eye cream that moisturizes without any stickiness or weird texture, but this one makes my eye area feel so soft and not greasy or sticky at all. It also seems to keep the area nice and plump which minimizes my dark circles and fine lines.\\r\\nThis eye cream does its job of moisturizing. I have really sensitive skin and it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t aggravate it at all. The scent is nice and clean and reminds me of a spa. My only wish is that it would also take care of fine lines.\\r\\nEye bomb is right!!! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is freaking amazing!!!!! During this winter months, my skin has been super dry and this is especially true when it comes to my under eyes, they have been very dry and dull looking! After I wash my face, I put this eye bomb cream on my under eyes and boom! They are instantly hydrated and looks less puff! While this product this a bit pricey, I believe it is worth every penny spent\\r\\nFeels very nice on the skin. Def makes the lines around my eyes less noticeable. Has a light fresh scent. So very moisturizing. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like it as much as I do. Lasts a very long time too.\\r\\nOne of the best eye creams ever. So hydrating and smells so good! I feel like it wake up my eyes in the morning!\\r\\nI love love love this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so hydrating for my dry parched under eyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super comfortable to wear and works well with my other products. The packaging is great and I highly recommend and will also repurchase.\\r\\nI received a deluxe sample of the Moisturizing Eye Bomb in a Belif Holiday Set. This eye cream has a lightweight texture that feels very refreshing. It provides up to 26 hours of moisture. Also, it smooths fine lines and wrinkles and increases elasticity and skin resilience for impeccable makeup application. I like this eye cream because it targets both of my major skincare concerns: dryness and anti-aging. I would definitely purchase the full-sized product.\\r\\nThis product is great! You only need a little and the container will last forever! It smells really good and is really hydrating. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great product all around and I love the way it feels but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure I notice a major difference in my under eyes.\\r\\nFinally a product that I\\'m not allergic to! belif is the only brand that I can put on my face without having a bad reaction to it. And this just feels so soothing and makes my skin feel bouncier\\r\\nGot a sample of this little baby on my Play! by Sephora subscription. This eye cream does wonders and keeps the area around my eyes moisturized. It\\'s light, smooth and very hydrating.\\r\\nI love this stuff. It feel like my skin drinks it right in and makes the area feel so hydrated! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my new favorite eye cream\\r\\nI have only used it a couple times so far but it is amazing so far! After three uses it started helping my dark circles! I am gonna see how it works the next couple uses and go from there. Honestly so far, so good!\\r\\nLoved this moisturizer! You get a lot in this tub and it really hydrates the undereye. Love this product would definitely recommend!! Only drawback was the swell was a bit unappealing but a great addition to my collection!\\r\\nI love Belif! This stuff is fragrance free and nice on my sensitive skin. It absorbs well but also plumps up the under eye area. I use it before bed and really like it! I received it in a Sephora sub box.\\r\\nThis is hands down my favorite eye cream ever! It\\'s fast to absorb, moisturizes my under eyes, and I have noticed a significant difference in my dark circles. The cream is cooling and feels good to just rub in. I have incorporated this cream into my daily routine, and will continue to repurchase :)\\r\\nMight be my holy grail of all under eye creams next to Tatcha. This is was less expensive and just as effective . I started noticing a difference in my makeup immediately after I started using this . I tried this and Clinique . I ultimately liked this one better. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more creamier and thinner on the skin . I bought this from Sephora and will purchase again .\\r\\nThis is incredibly moisturizing! I can\\'t say much about dark circle or bag reduction, but i apply this morning and night. When I use it under makeup, my under eyes look so much smoother!\\r\\nThis is the most hydrating eye cream I have ever tried! I put it on at night and in the morning, my undereyes are still moisturized\\r\\nI received a sample of this product in my Sephora Play, and I am blown away by the results, not only is intensely moisturizing, but I have definitely noticed a great improvement in the fine lines around my eye\\'s after only a week and half!!!! Definitely highly recommend this product!!!\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb checks off all the boxes when it comes to a quality moisturizing eye cream. This product claims to improve skin elasticity, and I can absolutely confirm this claim to be true.\\r\\nThis product is cool and refreshing under the eyes - I like applying it about every other day. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t usually have too much difficulty with dryness under my eyes, but it does feel moisturizing and I like to think I have seen some decrease in dullness in the skin around my eyes. I like that this uses natural ingredients.\\r\\nActually I did not buy this product I came in a box of Sephora. I love it and I love it, it\\'s a good product for my eyes, it takes away even the dark circles\\r\\nAbsolutely love this item it truly love my skin feeling rejuvenated light and fresh. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super late and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t way down or leave my skin will he not to mention I love the packaging\\r\\nJust began using this and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in love! Adds a lot of needed moisture to my under eye area and everything appears more supple and nice looking. Really have been enjoying this eye cream and am considering purchasing when I run out.\\r\\nThis eye cream is pretty good ,cooling and very Hydrating. I have been using it for a few months now and I really like it. This product was send to me free from Influenster for testing purposes. But I  would definitely  purchase it.\\r\\nJust started using this cream 2 weeks ago. So far I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed any changes to my eye area. However, the cream itself feels thick without being greasy and I love the formula it feels quite hydrating. Still trying it out but so far so good.\\r\\nLove this product!! Use this under your eyes before putting on concealer and your makeup will look fantastic all day. It has a very high level of moisturizing. Wait a minute after applying to sink into your skin.\\r\\nI use this every night. It helps my eyes stay moisturized the next day. It isn\\'t oily so my eyeshadow stays in place the next day\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0  I was never a fan of eye creams (i know, i know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like can i really call myself a beauty guru??) i always felt like they were the greeting card holidays of the beauty industry.\\xc2\\xa0  This eye cream changed that for me. First off it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s creamy and moisturizing to the touch, without waking up a greasy mess. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always looked younger than my age and have had a youthful presence to me, but this product will be my holy grail and secret weapon.  Skin Tone:  Neutral  Skin Type:  Oily  Skin Concerns:  Large PoresRednessSun Damage  Eyes:  Brown  \\r\\nI received a small sample in my Sephora play box. Been using it for two weeks and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m impressed. I had a a dry patch in the upper part of my inner corner that I could not get rid of. I used this and it disappeared within two days and hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come back. The cream absorbs well into my skin and keeps the area hydrated. Best eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried from my Sephora play box.\\r\\nAmazing!  Just like the regular moisturizer, the eye cream is fantastic!  I love everything about this stuff!\\r\\nThe best  eye bomb ever. I really recommend it. Really helpful product I Loved Mine. Worth the price\\r\\nI am so glad I had the chance to try out this product. I have fallen in love with the belif line. The moisturizing eye bomb has hydrated my under eyes so drastically. It makes canceler go one smoother with less creasing. With this product came a sample size of their true cream - moisturizing bomb and I loved it so much I purchased in from Sephora. Great brand!\\r\\nWas way too watery. Made my eyes have more wrinkles than before I started using it. I would not recommend or buy this product.\\r\\nI really like this eye cream because it is thicker, but I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen as much change in fine lines and wrinkles. I only use it at night because it is a little thicker than I like under my eye makeup.\\r\\nThis product is changing my life as a mom of a newborn. I have the biggest bags under my eyes and seem to have tried every cream already. Using this before putting on my makeup wakes up my eyes and just makes me look more put together. Love it!\\r\\nBelief moisture bomb eye cream. This product is just okay. I have a very dry eye area and this product was just not enough moisture to make a difference, especially with make up application. It was just enough moisture to give me some comfort, but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reduce the crepey-ness or flakes at all. Layered with an oil it works better, but I was looking for just a one step. If you have oily eyelids and are looking for an eye cream, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d bet you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love this product!\\r\\nThis eye bomb is the bomb!!!! Hands down best eye cream I have ever used. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so light and refreshing to apply. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moisturizes my undereye area without feeling greasy or oily. I hate a lot of thick creams for my undereye. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not generally a dry problem area for me but I still want to treat it well and take care of it. So far I am loving all the products from Belif. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re well worth the money.\\r\\nI really love the texture of this eye cream, its thick yet absorbs instantly into my skin.  It feels cooling and very moisturizing and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a strong scent.  The only complaint I have about this is that when I put it on my upper lid and too close to my bottom lashline it makes my eyes water like crazy!!\\r\\nAbsolutely incredible! Do not know where to begin! If you have fine lines and wrinkles around the eye area this one is a must have!!!! Great texture, does to clump on the skin. Does not have a strong scent and great even if your skin is sensitive.\\r\\nI\\'ve used this every morning for the past week. I haven\\'t really seen any results but hopefully after the 3rd week I\\'ll see something!!\\r\\nCompletely in love with this eye cream. It has definitely reduced fine lines and makes my eyes look brighter. I wear it in the morning and at night and love how my skin feels. I would definitely recommend this eye cream! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nSo very excited about using this eye boost! I have very dry undereyes, along with black circles. Super hydrating and goes on smooth and has a cooling effect in my opinion. Of course this is Korean, most of the goodies are! Will definitely buy again! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI really love this eye moisturizer from Belif! It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my eyes at all, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very gentle. It feels super refreshing and hydrating. The price range is good too compared to other high end eye creams, and a little bit goes a long way. I love the way my skin feels after using it!\\r\\nReceives this in an influenster voxbox, and I am still using it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not my absolute favorite as far as potency, but I like it for everyday.\\r\\nI was sent this by Influenster, and let me tell you---I am SO Thankful! This is one of my favorite parts of my skincare product. It exceeded any expectations I had. You can certainly tell the difference of when I wear it and when I don\\'t. So good!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nIts a really moisturizing eye cream. I use it for couple months already and I see a little bit of improvement. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a dark circles or wrinkles thou. I will buy again.\\r\\nSo much moisture! My eyes feel a sense of relief when I put this on\\xe2\\x80\\x94love how my skins feels with this.\\r\\nI got a sample from Sephora play box and I like this eye cream so far. It is moisturizing and sometimes I even use it if I get dry patches on my face. I can use it under my concealer and it does not cake. Smells good, packaging is cute. Like it!\\r\\nI really like the moisturizing eye bomb, it absorbs quickly and does not irritate my skin. It is also not greasy or leave a nasty residue as a lot of other eye moisturizers do. I would highly recommend this product as it works really well! I also like the light fresh scent it has.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nMy hg eye cream! It is light but powerful. Keeps my dry under eyes at bay and reduced the visibility of my little lines. Great price!\\r\\nI can\\'t say enough great things about this eye moisturizer. It has a gel consistency and absorbs instantly. Leaves a slight sheen that makes you look more awake. Also works well under makeup and on stressed/sensitive skin.\\r\\nI just started using this because I got a sample and so far so good. It leaves my under eye hydrated. I\\'m considering using it only at night because I\\'m not sure that it\\'s sitting well under makeup.\\r\\nLove this line! It is truly my holy grail skincare. My skin feels so soft and moisturized after using this eye cream. It is thick and rich feeling. I love it and would recommend this for people with dry skin, or trying to prevent fine lines and wrinkles.\\r\\nRich formula. It feels very refreshing under my eyes and it absorbs in about 30 sec to a minute. I like to use it in the AM and night but I have not seen a reduction in my dark circles yet so don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect it to help with that. I give it 5 stars for its moisturizing purposes though  I just feel like I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m preventing crows feet with it\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8f\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good moisturizer but it dried my face out so I had to stop using it. It works though, I felt that when I used it without applying any makeup it worked for me.\\r\\nI loved this product, it did make my eyes water in harsh weather but it made my under eyes so soft and depuffed them. also created a really amazing base for my concealer and foundation.\\xc2\\xa0 I loved it so much.\\r\\nEvery time I wear this product it gives me an instant woken up feeling because of the cooling sensation it gives! Love this in the morning when I need an extra boost\\r\\nVery good eye cream. Very gentle and it smells great! I was able to see the results in less than one week of use. It can be used before make up or before going to sleep after a long day. I would definitely recommend it.\\r\\nThis eye cream is super silky and creamy and does really hydrate my under eye area well. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not my absolute favorite eye cream but I will use it here and there. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice a difference in my dark circles but it does hydrate my eyes\\r\\nHad gone to sephora for some concealer, the girl who was helping me recommend me the eye bomb and saw a HUGE difference within two days.\\r\\nSuper mositurizing eye cream! it\\'s super rich but not greasy! I love using this before bed, it\\'s so soothing. You don\\'t need much and I like alternating this with another more light weight eye cream\\r\\nI received this in my Play bag. I need to use so little of this that the sample will last me a loooong time, especially since I need it only once a day. Takes a little time to absorb, but the softness remains even when I wash my face (water only) in the morning when I get up. I am noticing an improvement of the skin under my eyes too: it just looks better with less texture, and the skin feels softer. It\\'s pricey at $48, but considering how long it would last, I just may pick it up once my sample is gone.\\r\\nI liked the texture and coolness of it but unfortunately it made my eyes sting! :( I think it would be better suited for someone with less sensitive skin.\\r\\nI REALLY love this product. i wish that the bottle was bigger! It did really make me feel refreshed and way more awake around th eye area! I feel like the skin around was overall way more rejuevenated!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nIm bummed  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb  didn\\'t do much for me after reading the reviews I thought yeaayyy it\\'s going to get rid of my dark puffy under eye.  Sadly it didn\\'t change the appearance at all.  So the hunt continues to find a cream that gets rid of my dark circles and puffiness\\r\\nI recently just got into skincare and I can definitely say this is going to be a staple product for my skincare routine. It leaves my under eyes so hydrated and when I do my makeup my concealer blends like a dream. I use it day and night and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel heavy on my skin at all. I also have very sensitive skin and eyes and personally I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never had a reaction to the cream. A BIG plus for me!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m pleasantly surprised with this. I mean I was pretty sure I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like it, but I wanted to try some new eye creams and someone at Sephora made me a sample of this. I feel like this is an easy-go to option for people that are looking for instant hydration. I was looking for more anti-aging benefits, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely hydrating if that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all you need!\\r\\nThis stuff is pure eye gold, smells great, the texture and feel is so smooth and light, I wear it at night and wake up to my eyes feeling refreshed and tightened. Cute packaging too! Def worth the price\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my holy grail!! I looove so much because feel my eyes so hydrated, light and give me a cooling effect! Really likes! I recommend this one especially if you have oily or combo skin!\\r\\nI love this! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never been an avid eye cream user. But this one is extremely hydrating. ESPECIALLY during the winter time. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wake up with puffy eyes when i apply this before bed. And a little bit goes a long way!\\r\\nThis product is really good. It matched with my skin which is a little bit mixed.  I got it for free from Influenster but for sure I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll keep using it. I have friend that use it as well and they completely love it.\\r\\nI love this eye cream! A lot of times I am hesitant about putting them on before my makeup but I have had absolutely no issues with creasing or the formula being too thick! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice lightweight consistency and I do believe the fine lines have been reduced after using this product! I love it and will continue to purchase!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI love this eye cream! It is very hydrating! I really love the scent and a little product goes a long way, which makes it worth the price.\\r\\nThis eye cream is amazing! Light-weight (no tacky consistency whatsoever!) with a spa like fragrance, and not to mention there\\'s so much product inside. You only need just a little bit each time you use it. It honestly makes me look and feel refreshed and awake the next morning.\\r\\nSO INCREDIBLE!! i tried this in store and my brother said i looked more awake just two minutes later and then my min cant get enough it too! its like taking a cold shower. it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll REALLY wake you up. i recommend it to everyone. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8a\\r\\nI am a female in my 20s with oily, acne-prone skin. I loved this product. It has a lightweight, almost gel-cream texture that I enjoyed. It felt great underneath my eyes. It was light enough to use AM and PM and did not interfere with my makeup application. It did a great job of leaving my undereye area soft and moisturized. I have already repurchased this product. \\r\\nI like this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very rich and moisturizing but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel heavy and it sinks into the skin quickly. It has a subtle herbal/floral scent which is nice. A little goes a long way so the jar lasts while. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do much for dark circles though which disappointed me. But overall it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good.\\r\\nLove the way this product looks even before you even open it, i use it every morning after I wash my face and I can really see a difference, definitely met my expectations and then some it is a nice light cream not heavy at all and a little goes a long way. Highly recommend\\r\\nAbsolutely the favorite of products I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve received! This product is saving my under eye area. Reducing the texture and evening out the tones. Keeps hydrated. I have combo skin and it keeps dryness at bay.\\r\\nI love how moisturizing this product is!! A little goes a long way when it comes to this. I received a sample size in a beauty subscription box and I will definitely be purchasing again once I am out of my sample.\\r\\nThis moisturizer smells amazing, goes on smoothly and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t crease under my makeup!  I highly recommend this product!\\r\\nIf your concealer is drying out your under eye area, this eye bomb is the bomb. Texture is like a thin Vaseline, smells like it a bit as well. This stuff is best worn over night because it can effect makeup application. The Sephora Play sample .17 fl Oz lasted 14days.\\r\\nLove this product!! By far my favorite product Influenster has introduced me to! So moisturizing and makes my undereyes feel refreshed.\\r\\nBest everyday eye cream. Not too oily, but provides the right amount of moisture. Definitely one of my favorites.\\r\\nIt is very moisturizing. I am not sure they do anything for fine lines. It is also good under makeup. It is gentle.\\r\\nI received this as a deluxe sample which is why I even tried it. I\\'ve used supposed eye creams in the past and none did enough to be noticable so I couldn\\'t justify the price. This is different though and I actually can tell a difference so it was worth it to buy the full size product. My undereye area stays hydrated and this helps keep the area smooth to help keep my makeup creasefree and looking fresh all day. I do have wrinkles or skin that is losing its firmness but I assume since it hydrates like it claims that it will work on those issues hopefully containing them and keeping my skin tight and youthful looking. It takes just a dab of product so for the price it\\'s going to last for so very long. It\\'s a great under eye hydrator. I now use this as a part of my daily skin care routine\\r\\nGot this as a sample. The moisture bomb is true it does keep my dry skin moisturizer in this harsh dry winter. Love it and would recommend people to try it. Very effective and easy to apply. The consistency is just great\\r\\nI received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes from Influenster and I am sold! I am already a huge fan of the Belif brand, and this product is no exception. It works for both night time and day time use, and even sits beautifully under Concealer. I use his on top of an eye Serum and sometimes on top of an oil that I use under my eyes, and there are no issues with layering. The hydration lasts all day!\\r\\nYou. Guys...this product! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve have noticed a SIGNIFICANT change in my under eyes. No more oils, just moisturized and plumped! You need the tiiiiniest bit that goes a long way, so the price is definitely worth it!\\r\\nI got this in my feb Sephora play box, tbh I love it soooo much!!! I know it says for the eyes but I use it all over my face lmao my face is moisturized but not greasy AT ALL. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super light, and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave a residue on my face. Keeps my skin hydrated for a long time\\r\\nVery good only con is I\\xef\\xb8\\x8ft is a little heavy under your eyes so don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use too much Less is more in this case very nice thought plus really hydrating\\r\\nLove love love this eye cream! I got a sample through Sephoras monthly subscription box and I will definitely be purchasing a full size when its out. It smells fantastic and works like a dream\\r\\nThis is a lightweight eye cream that gives you a boost of moisture and refreshed looking eyes. It says to just apply a tiny bit around your eyes after applying moisturizer. I really like the way this eye cream smells, it smells fresh and awake, if that makes any sense at all. I love how thick this cream is while still feeling lightweight and non greasy. It gives your eyes and extra pep instantly.\\r\\nI always use a different eye cream at night than i the morning.  Again, I suffer regular bouts of insomnia so I\\'m very picky about my eye creams.  This definitely makes the cut. I keep my eye creams in the fridge and I apply this one at night and it helps in conjunction with the Pep Start I y yaw in the morning at keeping redness and bags at bay so the next day, it always looks like I got a full night\\'s rest\\r\\nI use this eye cream during my night skin care routine and it seems to be doing something. It keeps the little bumps under my eyes away and makes me feel better about adding an eye cream to my night routine\\r\\nThis is a super lightweight, refreshing eye cream that smooths fine lines with a 26-hour burst of moisture, boosts elasticity, and increases the resilience of the skin for flawless makeup application.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m obsessed with this product! It smells so good! It hydrated my under eyes but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make them oily, my makeup sits on top of it nicely! I will keep repurchasing. Totally worth the splurge!\\r\\nBelieve the hype. This stuff is my new addiction. Bought a travel sized one to try and eventually bought the full size. Goes on light, almost gel-like, and you only need a tiny bit to cover the eye area. It is ever-so-slightly cooling. Super refreshing. But boy, does it pack a punch when it comes to moisturizing. I CANNOT apply my under eye makeup without laying this down first. It makes my eyes feel so naturally hydrated without being thick or sticky. I live and die by this eye cream now, and would recommend it to literally anyone.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis eye cream is amazing. I love Belif eye creams. This version has a gel like consistency and feels super light. It absorbs quickly but feels extremely hydrating.\\r\\nI was really skeptical of this at first because most of the products from the brand really seem to cater to oily skin and I have desert dry skin. However, after giving this a trial for two weeks I can absolutely see a difference in the dryness under my eyes and on my eye lids. I do not yet have any fine lines around my eyes so I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t speak to that but I love the hydration that it has added! It makes my concealers stay better and crease so much less! I will repurchase when I run out\\r\\nI really love this as an under eye cream for night. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on the thicker side so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d advise using it at night but it really does moisturize your eyes and it does the job just by using a pea sized amount so it lasts you a long time for the price.\\r\\nI love this product. Super moisturizing and lightweight. Cream product that goes on like gel and dries quickly. Makes my eye area look more moisturized and gives me a more awake look.\\r\\nThis makes my under eye area feel nice and moisturized and I tend to use it before bed. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pricier than what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to pay for eye cream since I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve not yet found an eye cream thats TRULY a game changer. This will not help with under eye darkness at all (no eye cream will) but It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice if you have dry under eyes or want to use it under a matte / full coverage concealer or foundation\\r\\nI usually don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t invest in eye creams and such, but this one is really hydration and it makes my under eye concealer look so much better than before. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m unaware of long term benefits but I like it so far. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI was never a fan of eye creams (i know, i know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like can i really call myself a beauty guru??) i always felt like they were the greeting card holidays of the beauty industry.   This eye cream changed that for me. First off it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s creamy and moisturizing to the touch, without waking up a greasy mess. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always looked younger than my age and have had a youthful presence to me, but this product will be my holy grail and secret weapon.   After the first use you notice your skin looks more youthful yet smoother than before.   I would recommend this to anyone looking for an eye cream, especially for the gateway drug so to speak.\\r\\nLove the way this eye bomb feels on the skin. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightweight and does not leave the an oily residue.\\r\\nI really like the Belif eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moisturizing and great for sensitive skin. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a fragrance and is not irritating.\\r\\nThis eye cream is amazing!!! I have severe dermatitis especially under my eyes. It gets really dry and irritated and this eye cream helped so much. I am so happy with it\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very lightweight and moisturizing. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice anything wildly different with my skin but it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cause any trouble to my skin either. I like that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have harsh chemicals. Would try other things from this brand.\\r\\nI use this every night underneath my eyes using my ring finger and dabbing it underneath my eyes until it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s well absorbed. The days I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m too lazy, I just spread across and let it dry. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very moisturizing and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my skin at all.\\r\\nBelif eye bomb is a miracle. I am in love love love with this product. Subscription of play sephora has made my life easier to try new products, this Belif eye bomb was received in play box. It is 5ml small bottle. Little goes tooo long.  Only after few uses, my dark eyelids and dark circles faded. My sensitive eye skin got tightened and moistured.  It has light scent, which is appealing and fresh. Will definitely buy regular sized bottle.\\r\\nI love belif product because they work. Thus eye cream has changed my undereye skin texture over the months i have been using it. Definitely a great choice for any skin type, but especially good for dry skin.\\r\\nThis stuff is amazing. It leaves my skin feeling cool and moisturized. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a strong scent which I like because I hate constantly smelling products when I leave them on my face.\\r\\nLove love love this eye moisturizer!!!!! It is so hydrating but still sinks into the skin. My Tarte Shape Tape sits on top of it nicely with no problems. It has been keeping my dry under eyes nice and moisturized, though it is pretty expensive. I will Be repurchasing, because this k beauty brand has been working wonders for my skin. I also use the moisturizing bomb face moisturizer and love it! Good for winter hydration\\r\\nThis was seriously one of my favorite products that I received from a vox box I still use this to this day it feels so good on the skin and I really recommend you guys picking it up\\r\\nA great eye cream for night time. I enjoy this for deep moisture around my eyes, but I did have an issue with it. It kept balling up on my skin no matter how I used it. I tried using under and over other products, alone, etc. and after it sunk in it would ball up around my eyes. So I\\'m unsure if it actually kept the moisture in tact since it would peel away. I would never recommend this under makeup, I can\\'t see it working that way, at least for me.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI love the consistency of this product! I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s honestly doing anything for fine lines. I love it for its moisturizing properties! Great prep for eye makeup, it absorbs easily! I would definitely recommend this!\\r\\nI just started using it. I got it from Sephora but as of now it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true to what it stands by. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a little sample size but I am prepared to make this dire purchase. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m excited that my eyes look well rested!\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb great product it feels so soothing and fresh on my undereye area and smells amazing!\\r\\nLove it best ever !! Thank you for sending this out for me leaves my face totally refreshed\\r\\nThis product is very moisturizing! The price is comparable to other eye moisturizers. My only complaint is that it takes a little while to dry before I can put on concealer or other makeup.\\r\\nSuper hydrating with out feeling greasy or heavy. It\\'s great under makeup and feels very refreshing. A big plus is that it didn\\'t cause any milia to pop up which is a struggle for me\\r\\nThis is super moisturizing and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t interfere with makeup! Eye cream is very essential if you like to bake under your eyes. When worn overnight, this cream really smooths out the under eye area.\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a gel formula so it goes on super smooth and sinks in pretty much immediately. It really hydrates around my eyes and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave any residue. I can put makeup on within a few minutes of application and it goes on with no issues.\\r\\nI use this product every single day now. It\\'s my favorite moisturizer out there. It doesn\\'t leave me feeling oily which is my main concern. It leaves my skin extremely moisturized. This is my favorite moisturizer\\r\\nThis eye cream is super hydrating and goes on very smooth. I typically use this at night because for me when I wear it during the day it creates a film under my eye. When I wear over night I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get that film.\\r\\nThis product is amazing.. very moisturizing! The packaging is simple and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an easy product to find in most stores\\r\\nThis completely nourishes and hydrates your eyelids and under eyes and is extremely soothing.\\r\\nI love the entire Belif Moisture Aqua Bomb line. The eye cream is the perfect gel/cream consistency and it feels amazing on. It leaves my under eyes plump and hydrated. I use it day and night.\\r\\nI absolutely love this!!! My eyes drink it up,  i use this day and night! It wears well under makeup,  if I miss this step in my half awake morning routine I can definetly tell with how my makeup sits\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a big fan of the K beauty products. Belif is one of my favorite brands. Its reasonably priced for what you get and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get.  They leave out sulfates, parabens and phthalates. This cream is so moisturizing. It soaks right in. It really improves skin elasticity. I will be buying more Belif eye cream when my deluxe sample runs out.\\r\\nThis product is SUPER moisturizing and I love the way it feels on my skin. I don\\'t care for the smell though- it smells like citronella to me (which if you live in FL like I do, that is not a smell you want on your face!). I\\'m using the product as it was given to me by Influenster to test, but I wouldn\\'t buy it.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a fan of eye creams, but I guess  it was because I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t found the one for me. Belif did won my heart (and my money) when I used this eye cream/ moisturizer, my skin felt truly hydrated with a single use, and it really helped me with my eye puffiness situation.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d recommend this eye cream any day and with my eyes closed (pun intended). IT REALLY WORKS!!\\r\\nI am using this daily at the moment. It has a right texture for dry under eyes but now greasy. By looking at the name, I thought it would be light gel texture but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in between gel and cream. Highly recommend it!\\r\\nThis is one of the best products I have ever gotten. I got this free to try out from influenster! It is the best and now my new favorite daily product.\\r\\nI absolutely love this product. Since winter has returned once again. I found my face drying up and getting extremely oily because my skin is overly dry. I tried Origins products but no help. I tried this one and omg my skin just drank it all up and my skin looks more vibrant and feels softer. I love it so so much!!! Try it and you will see what I mean!!\\r\\nThis smells so good, like lemon merengue and moisturizes without being greasy or cakey. I like the packaging too. Modern and cool.\\r\\nI got this in a set at Sephora and I have really been liking it. It really keeps my eyes hydrated. I have pretty normal to dry skin but my T Zone gets oily. My under eyes are dry especially during the winter. This has helped so much. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very light and hydrating.\\r\\ni love this brand first off. i have the moisturizer and got the holiday collection and it has a deluxe sample of this in it. its definitely nice and light weight, you dont feel like you have a heavy eye cream on at all. but your eyes are definitely moisturized! idk id ill buy a big size of it just bc i want some anti aging factors since im turning 30. but if ur under eyes just need a litrle moisture this is a great find!\\r\\nThis gel-like Cream is exactly what you would expect if you have tried the Moisturize Bomb Face Cream.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very nice but I think it unnecessary if you already have the cream. Just use that instead of getting a separate eye cream.\\r\\nLove this! I use it all over my face too. Very rich but not heavy. I love the smell and it doesn\\'t bother my sensitive skin!\\r\\nA nice eye cream for moisturizing the under the eye area. I got a sample size of this and a little goes a long way!\\r\\nA tiny amount on your fingertip for each eye and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re done. This cream feels so good and refreshing underneath your eyes. I swear I see a noticeable difference when I use this.\\r\\nThis product did nothing for me. I didn\\'t feel it moisturized or hydrated around my eyes. It didn\\'t help get rid of my dark circles. It was a waste.\\r\\nThis eye cream definitely leaves my undereyes feeling to hydrated! I love it! It\\'s so gentle on my skin too worth the price!!\\r\\nI love this product! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s become a part of my everyday routine, especially now in the winter. The product feels lovely and my skin drinks it up quickly. I wish it had other beneficial products for anti-aging in it so I could cut down on other products. Overall a great purchase!\\r\\nLove this eye cream is so moisturizing. It leaves my under eyes so smooth and ready for makeup.\\r\\nI love this eye cream. It super hydrating and makes my skin feel nice and supple underneath my eyes!!! I love it so much and will continue to buy!!!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been on the hunt for the perfect eye cream for me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m only 20 so I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t looking for anything too heavy or with anti aging properties. This is the perfect eye cream for me because it sinks into the eyes instantly and is extremely hydrating.\\r\\nOmg old what maked this so good but I wish I could just swim in this cream. It feels sop good on my eyes and makes them so soft n moisturized. Could not name a single complaint.  Just wish it was more affordable is all.\\r\\nI really noticed a difference after using this eye cream for a few weeks. I will definitely be purchasing this when I run out. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a must have in my skincare routine now!\\r\\nI am always skeptical of eye creams because I have fine wrinkles and puffiness (more genetic than anything else) and have had a hard time finding something that has helped reduce the lines/puff. However, the Belif\\xc2\\xa0eye bomb lived up to its promise of moisturizing. I noticed a difference in my undereye area after a few days of use (specifically when using this before bed) and some of the winter dryness I was experiencing went away. While I think this product would work best with continued use, it\\'s definitely worth a try if you have undereye concerns!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nHoly Grail! Holy Grail! Best eye cream for dry skin, super light weight, makes your under eye so hydrated and plump. Definitely has helped with my dark circles and lines. Makeup applies beautifully on top, 100% worth every penny.\\r\\nI enjoy this balm. I first received a sample of it, and after using the sample up I bought myself the bigger tub since it was so effective in lessening the dark circles around my eyes. I really love it.\\r\\nI have been loving this eye cream. I love this moisturizing eye cream because it keeps my under eyes and lids nourish and moisturize. Does a really great job getting rid of fine lines. I love using this as a eyeshadwo primer help my shadow stay in place all day without creasing or getting greasy.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI really enjoy this eye moisturizer. I LOVE that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a gel form but I do wish it was a little more hydrating.\\r\\nSo lightweight and airy feeling. Works very well under makeup since it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cake up or feel as though you have painted any sort of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspackle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on\\r\\nI really really like this product. It moisturizes my eye area and doesn\\'t sting. It\\'s refreshing and I like it\\r\\nLOVE this eye cream. Really hydrates my under eyes without making them sticky or creasy.\\r\\nMy must have in my night time routine! I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do my facial cleaning without it! Amazing and moisturizing and not sticky at all\\r\\nLove the belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb! It went on smoothly, wasn\\'t oily/greasy, and didn\\'t have any particular scent so that was nice. The packaging was also really pretty so that\\'s always a plus. Would totally recommend to friends & family.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m actually very impressed with this eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a god send if you have very chapped under eyes that tend to look crepey under makeup. It has drastically changed my under eyes just as all of belif\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products have done for my skin. I highly recommend\\r\\nI really enjoy this eye cream! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice and luxurious plus it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super moisturizing. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m 27 and it definitely helps with my fine lines. The price tag is a little steep but you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find that with most great eye creams. Belif is a great company and I always feel that their moisturizers are calming and do a phenomenal job of moisturizing.\\r\\nI love this product. It smells great and moisturizes my under eye without making it feel filmy or oily. I received this product as a free trial through Influenster.\\r\\nThis product is amazing! I would recommended it to anyone who has puffy under eyes as it is a wonderful aid in reducing puffiness! I also love the packaging and the light fragrance it has. I will be buying this product again as it has become an essential part of my everyday routine I looove it!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI received this in a Vox Box and love it so much. The cream is super lightweight, but does a great job at hydrating the sensitive skin around my eyes.\\r\\nI actually liked this eye cream and of the ones I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried I feel like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the most effective. I had a deluxe sample and used it all up but I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite bring myself to purchase the full size, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bit pricey. I always add it to my cart tho\\r\\nUsed for one week. I can see amazing difference already. Darkness is going away. Skin feels tighter. I am in love with this stuff. Eyes stay hydrated all day too. I will buy again\\r\\nBest thing I have ever used under my eyes! I suffer from dry eyes. My Concealer always creases, now it goes on better because my skin is better.\\r\\nI really love the cooking effect on this product. I can already tell that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s making a difference! Will buy again.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis is amazing! I am still using it as it is very hydrating and long last for your under eyes!\\r\\nI love this eye cream! It refreshes my skin and makes me feel extra awake in the mornings !\\r\\nI tried a small sample of this from Sephora since I ran out of my normal eye cream I tried other belif items and they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that good so I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recommend this because of the price point I think the prices could be better on these products since they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t miracle workers\\r\\nThis is so light weight and comfortable! I love the formula and consistency of this. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good price for the amount it brings\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure this has done much for my dark circles necessarily but because of its water-based consistency, it feels super hydrating under the eyes! I love putting this on in the morning to help wake me up after feeling the cooling effect as it dries.\\r\\nBelif is an amazing brand of moisturizer. The eye bomb is thick but absorbs quickly . I love it. I have even started using it on dryer patches that occour in other areas of my face.\\r\\nIf you just want a nice moisturizing eye cream this is it. It makes your under I feel so refreshed great for waking up in the morning\\r\\nI really, really enjoy this eye bomb. It keeps my under-eyes moisturized and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the perfect base for my concealer.\\r\\nI\\'ve used this many times and it works amazing. Especially after windy chapped skin days. It\\'s just a bit too expensive for the size so I can\\'t justify keeping it in permanent rotation.\\r\\nVery hydrating. I felt like my eyes had become very dry. But when I started using it, I felt a very positive change. Used it for the first time. But I also got it for my mom. She loved it too\\r\\nLove this product it really moisturizes and helps when I put my makeup its is a bit pricey but in my opinion it is worth it I got it from Influenster to try for free for reviewing purposes\\r\\nPackaging was great!\\xc2\\xa0 The texture of the eye cream was just right- not too thick, however, I was hoping I would notice a little more of a difference with it.\\xc2\\xa0 I did notice some changes and it definitely has kept the area under my eyes moisturized but I was hoping for a little more.\\xc2\\xa0 Still would recommend and for the size of the container, you can\\'t beat it.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis cream is so thick and hydrating under the eyes ! My eyes felt and looked more smoother it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very effective I purchased mines at Sephora and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very gentle under my eyes and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t break me out at all ! This Belif product fits the bill perfectly! As others have mentioned, its texture is somewhere between a gel and a cream. I think this allows it to soak in and be very hydrating like a cream while not leaving a greasy residue. That makes this a perfect morning eye cream for me as my under eye concealer then goes on smoothly and doesn\\'t crease! I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes but all opinions are my own.\\r\\nThis stuff changed my routine. I love this so much it has helped with puffiness and fine lines. It feels so light and soft under the eyes and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quite refreshing.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been trying a sample of this product and so far I like it! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a gel like consistency that glides under the eyes. I notice my under eyes are more plump and the fine lines look more diminished, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like using the Belif aqua bomb for your under eyes\\r\\nThis stuff is amazing! It feels so refreshing when you put it on. You barely need any, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll last forever.\\r\\nSuch a wonderful undereye cream.. it keeps my under eye hydrated all day.. it also helps with filling in fine lines by the eye area .. the price is very reasonable for this awesome product and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll definitely be purchasing more once I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m done with the one I have .. I received this product for testing purposes from Influenster\\r\\nThis moisturizing eye cream is amazing! It works wonders for dry under eyes and it really smooths out the skin also. This is my first product from them and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hooked now!\\r\\nIt was really nice. \\xc2\\xa0I liked that it was light enough to wear during the day as well. \\xc2\\xa0It had a nice cooling affect.\\r\\nI love how smooth and hydrating this moisturizer is. I have dry skin, especially in the winter so this product keeps my eye area feeling soft and renewed. The packaging is really nice too.\\r\\nThis is a super hydrating eye cream - if you have dry, crepe like under eyes, you will like this eye cream. It has a nice, non sticky texture that works well for night or day, and sits well under makeup. One jar will last you for a decent amount of time- totally worth it!\\r\\nMy under-eye area gets so dry so i decided to give this a try and incorporate it into my skincare routine and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m loving it. Not only are my under-eyes moisturized but it also helps with creasing when I apply concealer.\\r\\nI really like this stuff! My under eye area is fairly dry and creases pretty bad when I wear makeup, but when putting this cream on beforehand it makes a pretty big difference. I also only got a sample of this and it has lasted me so long. I will probably purchase this when my sample runs out.\\r\\nI received this as part of a VoxBox and fell in love with the brand as I had not been aware of it in the past. I have always used eye serums/ creams as prevention and to keep them well hydrated and this cream does exactly that. The price is reasonable as you receive a decent amount of product and the cream does what it says, and HYDRATES.\\r\\nLove this eye cream! Great moisture not sticky. Lasts all day. I have early signs of eye aging and this keeps my eye area moisturized.\\r\\nReally nourishing and moisturising cream which goes perfect under makeup. Didn\\'t see any effects on wrinkles or dark circles, and it doesn\\'t claim either.\\r\\nI love this whole entire brand of Aqua bomb from the face lotions or gels to the eye products if your skin is thirsty for moisture it will soak it right up\\r\\nGot a few samples of this at GenBeauty NY \\xe2\\x80\\x9817 and I have been hooked ever since!! Love!!!\\r\\nBelif has the best face moisturisers, so I was excited to receive a sample of this eye cream. Feels sooo nice on the skin, and very hydrating. I would buy this one for sure.\\r\\nNice thick moisturiser, especially for an overnight cream. Helped with my eye wrinkles and fine lines too! Definitely worth a try!\\r\\nIt freshens up my eyes. After a long week nothing gets my eyes a lift like this \\xc3\\xa9ter mask bomb. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t purchase it at first but instead got a try out from Sephora and after i ran out went back straight for my bottle!\\r\\nThis is my favorite brand! Beliefs eye cream is a gel/watery cream it is not thicker but it works amazingly! It smells really good too and helps the appearance of my under eyes look great after a few uses! I would highly recommend this brand!\\r\\nLove love love this eye-cream for days where I need a bit of extra moisture. A little bit goes a long way, but makes my eyes appear more awake and it also helps with puffiness. I also love that this cream doesn\\'t affect the application of my concealer - bravo!\\r\\nLove this one! I got it for free from Influenster VoxBox. My under-eye is hydratedand feels smooth. Even applying my under eye concealer is even better now. I use to have very dry under eye and my concealer doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look great on at all. I will be re purchasing this one again.\\r\\nThose eye cream is fantastic! My under eye bags are not noticeable anymore and the skin is very soft!\\r\\nReally liked this under eye moisturizer, mostly because of the texture and the cooling feel under eyes. I apply it before going to bed and again under makeup in the morning and I do believe it makes my under eye area look more plump and moisturized\\r\\nI loved this product. In a few weeks I start to see real results in my eyes. They were dark but after start using Belief was moisturizer and lighter and some expressions lines was gone! And the best think is that there is lot of product and you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to use too much which makes this product durability longer.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really loving this.  The Aqua bomb is my all time favorite face moisturizer so I wanted to give this a try.  It does what it says it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to do. I have noticed a difference in the moisture under my eyes. In winter I usually do get fairly dry and my concealer starts to look crepey but not anymore with this eye creme\\r\\nI got this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I can absolutely say that I would pay for this product! After using it for a few weeks there is definitely improvement with the wrinkles around my eyes. And it smells amazing and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate my eyes in the least bit. Definitely recommend!\\r\\nI have been using this product for about a month, and I have noticed a huge difference in the texture and softness of my eye area!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nLove this eye moisturizing cream! It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel too heavy and sets in nicely over night. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very gentle and perfect for the freezing, dry winter.\\r\\nVery hydrating!! Compares to most high end eye creams it is very gentle the smell isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t horrible the packaging is boring doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem appealing or exciting at first glance. I personally wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy this product just because I have one I already committed too.\\r\\nThis was my first time trying belif, and I am very impressed. It\\'s a great value, and I can feel the intense moisturizing in the morning and throughout the day. It\\'s made a big difference in my eye area. The overall area looks plump with moisture, and more youthful. Love it, will definitely purchase again.\\r\\nIt moisturizes well, but I haven\\'t really seen any visible results. No brightening or lifting effect or anything like that. It\\'s a decent eye cream, but I don\\'t think the higher price is justified. I\\'ve tried less expensive creams that, in my opinion, work just as well.\\r\\nSo moisturizing! The packaging is amazing and easy to use. The product is thick, but not too greasy\\r\\nGreat moisture. No oily feeling after Application. Sinks into skin. Reduces puffiness.\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any images but this profuct is miracles i had really bad dark circles & fine lines & within one try it made a diff... no i cannot live without it , because this has changed my makeup routine forever .\\r\\nThis eye cream has a light, nongreasy texture, but it packs so much moisture. It absorbs smoothly without much effort, and my eye skin feels smooth and moisturizer without any residue. I can tell that it has minimized the appearance of fine lines around my eyes- I am very happy with this purchase!\\r\\nThe eye bomb worked wonders!! Made my skin feel super soft and very healthy. Never felt oily or like it was too much for my skin. Would definitely recommend to others who are looking for a great moisturizer ! Very happy with the product and use it every day!\\r\\nI love this eye cream! Tap a little bit under your eyes to help minimize fine lines. Using this under foundation is life changing, my makeup ALWAYS used to crease into my fine lines which is never a good look. Now my makeup looks flawless all day!\\r\\nI adore this eye cream! I like to wear it in the morning since it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not very rich. Does a great job of moisturizing my undereye area and it helps my undereye concealer go on better. I do wish it had more wrinkly fighting ingredient, but I do like it and once my deluxe sample runs out, I will purchase the full size.\\r\\nI really love this eye cream. I use it every night and have noticed less wrinkles and my eyes aren\\'t as puffy. The packaging is really nice. I will repurchase when mine is gone. I recommend this product to anyone who has eye concerns.\\r\\nThis is very hydrating, and works very well for my sensitive eyes. The formula does not clog my pores, and makes the skin around my eyes feel less irritated during the dry winter. I think that this would work for all skin types.\\r\\nSuch a great product. It smells really good, it has a cooling sensation and it really feels hydrating. I really would recommend this product. Price is ok, you get what you pay for and that is great quality! I would definitely buy it again. I have really dry skin and this is such a great product for all my dry girls and boys out there :D\\r\\nThis keeps the skin around my eyes very well moisturized up until winter. At that point I have to add in a facial oil as well. I do love the feeling and smell of this product, and the price isn\\'t too steep either.\\r\\nI got a small travel size; did not see any significant improvement under my eyes...used it during the day and night; did not improve the dark circles under my eyes.\\r\\nIt is an awesome experience, thanks for the opportunity. It totally moisturized my skin in this winter time, with a soft touch. This is was my first time using the mosturizing bomb and for sure I will get more.\\r\\nThe BEST EVER. I\\'m so in love with this ... I promise it works great and you will never try a different product\\r\\nI received this product for free via influenster for testing purposes and I absolutely LOVE it! It is a super hydrating product & delivers on all its claims. A little goes a long way so if you feel that this purchase is a splurge, rest assured you do get your bang for your buck.\\r\\nLove this product. Lightweight & effective!!! I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d use it at first... now it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a staple.\\r\\nThis eyes produt works amazing:) it also smells really good feels fresh & very moisturizing\\r\\nI really like this eye cream! I have never used eye cream before and it\\'s very hydrating. I haven\\'t noticed much of a difference with dark circles but it seems to be helping with puffy-ness.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nTotally made a difference in hydration under my eyes! I noticed a difference within a matter of days!\\r\\nThis item makes your skin around your eye area stay hydrated through this dry season. Your eyes look very refreshed after a night rest in this product. One of the must have on my beauty routine now. Its a little pricey for the size.\\r\\nI really a m a big fan of this eye cream ! Keeps my under eyes very hydrated, makes my concealer go on very smooth without creasing! I wear it every morning and every night ! \\xf0\\x9f\\x99\\x8c.\\r\\nThis eye cream is amazing! I have super dry eyelids and skin in general so I apply this to the top of my eyes and all the way around to my under eye. It\\'s not too thick, so it absorbs into the skin quickly! I use it every day!\\r\\nI absolutely love this lotion. It has really help to combat my dry skin in the winter. It smells great and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make your skin feel oily or gross after you put it on. Highly recommend it.\\r\\nBest eye cream I\\'ve used so far! It\\'s super hydrating and moisturizing and doesn\\'t irritate my eyes. I also like the packaging and the amount of product inside. I mean, for the price it\\'s definitely worth it since a little goes a long way. TIP: I usually place this inside the refrigerator for like an hour before I use it so it would have a cooling and refreshing feeling when applied!  Note: I received this belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb product free for testing purposes from Influenster. Reviews/opinions of the product are solely my own.\\r\\nSoooooo good!! This is a game changer. I didn\\'t get the point of eye creams (they\\'re so expensive..) until I tried this. I got it for free in their Belief Vox Box to test, and I loved it. It is so moisturizing and soaks in immediately. It keeps you looking fresh and glowy and bright eyed all day!\\r\\nI love this product! Highly moisturizing and is a great addition to my nighttime skincare routine. My skin always feels super hydrated in the morning and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave a heavy, oily, or greasy feel when applied. Unfortunately, I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen an improvement in wrinkles/creasing but I still use the product everyday anyways!\\r\\nThis is the best eye cream I have ever used! It not only is hydrating but my makeup also went to sooo smooth over top!\\r\\nI really loved this product and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now a part of my every day routine. it truly works wonders and works to depuff your undereyes and really moisturizes them. The texture of the cream is great, it is thick and really gets the job done. I would recommend this product to everyone.\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0I think the biggest factor in that is that the Moisturizing eye bomb is the perfect combination of moisturizing (of course) with a nice texture and enough substance to stick around all day or night.\\xc2\\xa0I love the packaging and the size is very generous. I\\'m used to eye creams in little jars, but this one is a much more generous size and I\\'ve barely made a dent in it.\\xc2\\xa0It is a gel cream texture, not oily, and it absorbs well, but also protects the eye area so your skin doesn\\'t just suck it up and leave the area dry again.\\r\\nI am literally OBSESSED with this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super moisturizing but not greasy at all, very lightweight, and acts as a really good primer under my makeup. It even smells good too! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used a lot of eye creams in the past and this one by far is my favorite\\r\\nit was hydrating, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t clump, or ball up! layered well under make up! but i saw no huge difference in dark circles! you get a good amount & only need a little to feel it hydrating your skin! i got my product free from influenster to review, but it is my honest opinion!\\r\\nLove everything about this, It moisturizes and brightens my skin! I just wish, however, that the product itself wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so heavy, as it leaves my skin feeling greasy. The product doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try down, it remains oily. And although I love the affects of this product, I wish it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so heavy and greasy feeling.\\r\\nI really love this product! Its name is not misleading, it intensely moisturizes the eye area. Its great for makeup application in reducing fine lines as well. I could definitely recommend to anyone who it looking for a hydrating eye cream!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never used an eye cream before but always wanted to so when I received this I was so excited. It leaves my under eyes so hydrated and it lasts all day! It also doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel tacky at all which I really like so I definitely recommend this to everyone\\r\\nI really Like this product. I have tried a lot of face creams, wrinkle creams, and night creams. I feel that my skin looks moisturized and not as dry. I also see a difference in my fine lines. I would recommend.\\r\\nI like this product. I got a small size as a stocking stuffer in a kit, and although it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice, I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t purchase the full size. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty mediocre. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very thin and gel like, so it does hydrate and make concealer apply nicely if the concealer is water based.\\r\\nLove it!\\xe2\\x99\\xa1 It\\'s a nice product that leaves the eyes area hydrated and good looking for hours... I got it complimentary from influenster but now is a must in my shopping list. Recommended!\\r\\nExtremely hydrating! Not too sticky or slimey. A little really goes a long way and I think the sample I got will last me a long time!\\r\\nI love this stuff. it is very moisturizing and a little goes a long way. I have combination skin and I use this product daily.\\r\\nSuper great eye cream. Very silky texture and leaves the eyes looking smooth and youthful.\\r\\nThis eye cream is sooo good y\\xe2\\x80\\x99all! It moisturized without irritating my eyes, light weight and adorbs easily. Im a huge fan of the whole skincare line now!\\r\\nThis was amazing! I usually have ugly early stages of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwrinkles\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccrows feet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d around my eyes but this seriously helped smooth out my skin as well as plump it back up and make it soft and supple again! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m def going to be purchasing this over and over lol\\r\\nNice and moisturising . Set into the skin which was good before makeup application but I wound up wishing I could reply through out the day because I needed moisture\\r\\nLoved this product. Got it for free from Influenster to test it out and feel in love. Super recommend\\r\\nHOLY GRAIL HOLY GRAIL HOLY GRAIL. I love this so freaking much. Works wonders on my dry under eyes and changed my life. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty expensive but so worth it.\\r\\nLove it! Very hydrating. I haven\\'t noticed a difference with smoothness, but I am much less dry\\r\\nSooooo moisturizing! Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think this product would do as much as it did! My undereyes have been so dry it was making me look old! Come to the rescue box box with Belief moisture eye bomb! No dry undereyes here this is the bomb.com, seriously! belif Holly Jolly Hydration Set \\r\\nI really like the texture of the eye bomb. It wasn\\'t greasy and the smell was not off putting. It applies quite easily and is absorbed well under the eyes. Overall it is a quality product. I don\\'t have much use for it, but I would recommend it to people that suffer from dry skin.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nVery hydrating and love the consistency. Happy with results after only a few weeks. Excited to see what happens after a few months.\\r\\nThis cream is so so nice and feels very luxurious. It is very smooth and feels very nice on skin. Works great\\r\\nBest eye cream! I love this and the consistency of it! Leaves my under eyes feeling so hydrated\\r\\nLOVE this product. I\\'ve been a fan of belif since I first tried their moisturizer last year, and this eye cream made me an even bigger fan! The cream feels luxe and cooling on the skin, and smells great (although the scent is light and not overpowering). Helps with fine lines and brightening! Definitely recommend!!!\\r\\nI am so obsessed with this moisturizing eye bomb that I am not sure I can live without it. It revitalizes my eyes and refreshes my skin. This is by far the best eye moisturizer that I have used and I will absolutely be purchasing this when I run out.\\r\\nThe eye bomb is a must have. It makes my eyes look so much more awake and alive. It super hydrates preventing wrinkles and helping stave off any more darkening. A little bit goes a long way. I use day and night.\\r\\nThis was an awesome eye cream if you are looking for hydration. It did not help with under eye darkness but it was great to keep things looking plump.\\r\\nBest eye cream ever! I received this eye cream as a free sample, and have been using it for a month straight, morning and night. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extrmely moisturizing without being too heavy. Great for before concealed application and for fine lines and puffyenss because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so thin. A little bit goes a long way so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth the price.\\r\\nIt was extremely moisturizing. When you put it on you felt it immediately hydrating the under eye and it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave any residue. It brightened a bit after a couple days and helped plump the fine lines, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standout feature was the hydration.\\r\\nThis product is fantastic. I love it so much. It is so hydrating and feels so good around the eyes.\\r\\nBelif moisturizing eye bomb is THE bomb! It is so velvety and light! It goes on smoothly and feel hydrating right away! It smells amazing, and you only need a little bit, so the container lasts a long time. Definitely recommend!\\r\\nbelif Moisturizing Eye BombI absolutely love this product so much! The packaging is great and I love that this eye cream really hydrates my skin. The price is a little high but a little goes a long way so you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need a lot of product. I highly recommend this eye cream:)\\r\\nI really liked this eye moisturizer cream, however it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any better than some of the other products I already use. While it is very moisturizing it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help with swelling or puffiness. Therefore I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find it to be worth the cost it retails for. I got this as a freebie in my VoxBox but once I finish it I probably won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t purchase it on my own.\\r\\nMiracle worker! Loving this! So smooth, no greasy residue! Works wonders underneath my makeup with no fine lines! Absolutely amazing! Highly recommend this product!\\r\\nObsessed!!!! Keeps my eye area feeling baby soft. I was originally sent this for testing purposes but I actually went ahead and repurchased for my sister and mom. They loved it as well!!\\r\\nThis product is a life saver. It is super hydrated and smell amazing. A little goes a long way.\\r\\nIm blown away how amazing this eye cream is! It is my absolute favorite. I cannot believe how well it works. Its texture and what is does for my eyes just blows my mind. best eye cream ever!\\r\\nLove this cream! Feels so soft and I love that I can wear it under my make up and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t affect it at all. The smell is great also not to over powering.\\r\\nGreat product. It keeps my eyes looking and feeling refreshed and makes me look more awake for the day\\r\\nThis eye cream is really hydrating and absorbs very easily into the skin. It also has a slightly gel-like texture which makes it a bit cooling too.\\r\\nI got this free in my VOX BOX, I have been really impressed with the results. Lots of moister not to heavy, I will definitely repurchase again\\r\\nThe cream is very hydrating and light weight. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mess my make up. Makes my eye area feel very fresh. The size of the bottle is very generous. No perfume on it which is very nice.\\r\\nThe moisturizing eye bomb from promises up to 26 hours of intense moisture while boosting skin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s elasticity. I could feel the difference after application, and although the cream itself was heavy, it easily sunk into skin without leaving me feeling greasy or filmy.\\r\\nBelif is my new favorite skincare brand omg everything i have tried is amazing and totally worth the money. My undereyes are always dry and full of wrinkles and puffy and just an overall nightmare even after a few uses my skin is so much more hydrated i still have wrinkles but i can see a decrease but im sure with a longer time use it will go away!\\r\\nThis product is AMAZING! I\\'ve been using Belif moisturizer for awhile now, and this is just as good. It has a calming and cooling effect on your eyes, and it has a light scent that is lovely. I noticed a difference after one use, so this is definitely a stable for me!\\r\\nThis is an amazing eye cream. It is nice and soft. It moisturizes very well. It is not thick and caky like.\\r\\nAfter not knowing of this brand prior to receiving the belief Moisturizing Eye Bomb I have to say, I was excited to try this product but felt let down.\\xc2\\xa0 While his product absorbs quickly, I still felt like I saw many of my fine lines and tired eyes. It did seem to make the skin a little brighter but in terms of really hiding or helping reduce the lines around the eyes, I would not say this is my go to product\\xc2\\xa0 *I received this product complimentary for review purposes from Influenster\\r\\nThousand percent love this product and one of my favorites received so far complimentary from influenster.  It works amazing to relieve puffiness and tired eye, it is high shine and glistens so i keep it on till it absorbs before makeup application or use it at night. Have already repurchased\\r\\nI highly recommend this eye aqua bomb. Esp for this drying cold weather. I love using it\\r\\nThis is one of the best eye creams I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever tried. It very smooth  and it absorbs very quickly. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not greasy at all and it keeps my eye area moisturize for a while eight hours. This one is a keeper.\\r\\nThis is a great moisturizer! It also helps for my under eye concealer to go on smoother. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slightly cooling as it goes on and stays hydrated for a long time. However, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really seem to be doing anything for my fine lines or wrinkles. My under eyes still crease throughout the day with makeup and my lines have not improved. It also hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had any brightening affects. This is a really good moisturizer, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on the pricey side to just be a moisturizer. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I will be repurchasing.\\r\\nThis is probably the most moisturizing under eye product I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supple and cold and keeps t moisturized! Just wish it was able to get rid of dark circles, other than that the product is perfect\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very moisturizing as it claims to be and helps dry undereyes a lot. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as brightening as I thought it would be but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the product\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fault. I would highly recommend this to other people though. \\xe2\\x98\\xba\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\r\\nI just started using this not too long ago. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice that big of a difference in my under eye appearance yet so I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to give it 5 stars. It does what it claims to do. It is very expensive but you do get a lot out of it\\r\\nThis eye cream is amazing! It\\'s winter where I am right now and this eye cream is extremely hydrating without being oily or greasy. It has lightweight formula and a pleasant scent. It absorbs quickly into the skin and I love it!\\r\\nI tried this product out when it was a 100 Point perk at Sephora.  My dry undereyes and eye lids drink this stuff up!  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super hydrating and feels like a cooling gel on the eyes.  A little bit goes a long way.  When my sample is gone I will purchase the full size.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moisturizing but honestly I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen any drastic changes to my puffy and eye bags. I love the brand though\\r\\nLight weight texture, but packs a TON of moisture.   The Belif Moisturizing eye bomb glides on skin, is absorbed quickly, and keeps my needy under eye area looking fresh and smooth all day\\xe2\\x80\\x94 under makeup or not.   I like that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a strong scent (really not much of a scent at all). The packaging is also super cute, I think I want to do my second bathroom in black and aquatic blue now.\\r\\nI am completely obsessed with this eye cream!! It goes on smoothly and has very visible results!! This is the first time I have used this eye cream and I totally recommend it!! It has amazing moisturizing ingredients that provides a long lasting moisture!! It also has detoxifying ingredients such as comfrey leaf!! I will most definitely repurchase this product!!belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI purchase the holiday travel set that included a few of the Belif products. My two favorite items I tried were the face moisturizer (the actual name escapes me at the moment) and the Moisturizing Eye Bomb. This moisturizer has a nice consistency its not too thick or too liquidity which I like. It absorbs easily and doesn\\'t leave any sticky residue (always a plus). I like the scent, it\\'s not too strong and dissipates fast. I find that it\\'s moisturizing enough for my under eyes.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI received this in my Vox Box and HOLY MOLY it is amazing. The BEST eye cream I have ever tried. It really does hydrate for 24 hours and leaves my under eyes bright, supple and hydrated. I love it and will be buying it again. It has reduced my fine lines and rid me of awful dry patches I would normally get near the inner corner of my eyes. LOVE LOVE LOVE\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis has made me look so much fresher! I always look well rested now thanks to this eye cream. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helped eliminate lines and darkness under my eyes and has pumped in hydration!\\r\\nInfluenster and belif sent me this to try out and i have to say it came at the perfect time. I was doing research on eye creams and getting ready to go out and purchase one to try out and this was just dropped off at my doorstep! (It was fate I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m pretty sure). I really love this product. I was starting to notice some very fine lines under my eyes and I felt like my eyelids were very dry but after using this for a few weeks the eyes definitely feel a lot more hydrated eyeshadow eyeliner concealer all types of make up are so much easier to apply now and most importantly it really diminished the look of my fine lines. A very small amount goes a very long way for both eyes and you get a lot of product so this will definitely last you for a very very long time.  I highly recommend this product. I will be purchasing it when i run out for sure\\r\\nI LOVE this product. WORTH the raves! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually quite ALOT in a jar but would give a recommendation on the application: you honestly just need a pearl size for BOTH eyes. My first few times I put too much and started to get small bumps around my eyes. But it went away quickly and now it is fine. Would like the packaging to come with a spoon or such since I feel like it would help with the portion size control application\\r\\nI was lucky enough to receive this product from Influenster and it came at the best time because I had just run out of my previous (ineffective) eye cream. I am one of those people that has always had bags and dark circles under my eyes (even when I was a kid)! This product was exactly what I needed. In fact, I like it so much that I would buy it at full price! The cream seems to be more of a lightweight, soothing gel. It also has a light herbal scent. The ingredients are meant to be highly hydrating and are also supposed to boost elasticity. After using this, the increased hydration is definitely noticeable, so this really helps prep my under eye area for makeup. I would absolutely recommend this product!\\r\\nThis eye cream is very moisturizing. I feel like there is a noticeable difference in just a few days. Works well under makeup but I use it mostly before bed. A little goes a long way.\\r\\nI love this it is extra hydrating and it leaves your eyes hydrated for hours. Not only do I use this at night but I use this every time I go out and  before I apply my makeup. I would definitely buy again and recommend this to friends and family\\r\\nThis is a good eye cream! It is very similar in scent and texture to the aqua bomb. It has a light blue color, subtle herbal scent, and acts like a water cream. It provides high moisture and helps to plump up dry under eyes. I recommend trying it!\\r\\nSuper great eye cream for moisturizing and plumping the eye area by filling in fine lines! However I knocked off a star because it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really help with puffiness which is something I struggle with.\\r\\nSO BOMB! Just like their moisturizing aqua bomb, my under eyes feels like it drank a gallon of water. Great for winter time when my face gets dry spots, especially under my eyes. Recommend 10/10!\\r\\nLove this! I have dry skin and my under eyes do tend to be one of my more dry areas. This eyes cream is so nice at hydrating the under eye are, I use this as my daytime eye cream as it is great for use before makeup. It has a really nice texture, sinks in to the skin evenly and fast and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave any kind of residue just supple skin. I think the price point is good for a high end brand. Definitely recommend!\\r\\nI suffer from eczema around my eyes and this product is so moisturizing and calming!! You need such a small amount which makes it such a good value and it sinks it quickly. I use it at night so that I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to worry about putting makeup on right over it.\\r\\nBelif continues to impress me! All of their products are so hydrating. I have combination skin so the areas around my eye tend to be more oily than other parts of my face. I love that this moisturizer lasts the whole day without making eye area overly shiny/oily/greasy/etc. after hours of wear. A little goes a long way so I think for the amount of product you get, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s well worth the price.\\r\\nSo hydrating and feels amazing on the skin! A good price for how much product you receive! It will last forever!!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI loooooooove this product! It is so refreshing and delicate with the skin around the eyes . This is a great product that comes in handy during winter time . It is nursing and the eyes don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel too heavy after application. It gives a great boost of moisture to the skin and I enjoy it !\\r\\ni received the belif moisturizing eye bomb from influenster to test. while i am a huge fan of the fact this brand, specifically this product is paraben, sulfate, phtalate, mineral oil, etc. free i was not impressed enough to switch from the brand i already use (also free of these harmful ingredients).\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI recently bought this from Sephora and it has been working well for me. I put this on my eyes before I go to bed and it keeps my skin very hydrated\\r\\nThis eye cream works wonders! It moisturizers and nourishes as well as brightens up your under eyes.\\r\\nI really like this eye cream. It soaks well into my skin and goes well under makeup. When I use this eye cream I think my under eye concealer looks better.\\r\\nI have hereditary dark circles and they have become noticeably lighter as well as the fine lines looking more plump and product now sweeping into them.\\r\\nThis was sent to me by Influenster and it is amazing. It depuffes my eyes left them feeling rejuvenated. I love that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a strong smell and that is water like cream. It is expensive but it is totally worth it.\\r\\nI love this I product it does a great job at reducing puffiness and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allow your make up to settle into your fine lines\\r\\nI love this brand. I use this eye cream daily. It amazingly moisturizing , without the oiliness : residue feeling that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s left behind but some other moisturizers. This skin around my eyes looks hydrated and less puffy. Loveee!!\\r\\nI really don\\'t like the texture of this eye cream. If you tap your finger into it, you will get almost no product on your finger. You really have to dig in there to get some out and then once on the undereyes, doesn\\'t really do much. I feel like you have to use a lot to adequately moisturize the undereye area just prefer others to this.\\r\\nI received this complimentary in my most recent voxbox and I LOVE it! I find a lot of eye creams to be too heavy for daytime but this one is unique in that you can apply makeup right on top of it yet still have hydration that lasts a good portion of the day. It\\'s great for evening use as well. Highly recommend!\\r\\nThis is the ultimate eye cream. I sleep in this and wake up with my under eyes looking brighter and feeling more firm. I feel like I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been searching for the perfect eye cream forever and I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found it. Ugh. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rave about Belif enough! Everything from this brand is A+.\\r\\nThis product is great it hydrates you very well all your eye feels fresh and awake when you apply the product. the consistency of the cream is very soft and it is absorbed quickly to the skin.\\r\\nSadly, I know the time has come for me to start looking into eye creams. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know where to begin! CUE Belif VoxBox! Prior to receiving my gratis Moisturizing Eye Bomb, I dove into a rabbit hole and did as much research as I could.   I truly feel like I lucked out. This stuff is AMAZING! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incredibly lightweight yet hydrating. I feel instantly fresh when I apply it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and a little goes a long way!  Couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be happier with this product.\\r\\nI love belief but this was just ok for me. Not as moisturizing as the aqua bomb. I was disappointed.  Won\\'t be repurchasing one I use this up.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best eye cream I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever tried. I have terrible deep set eyes and dark circles. And I typically never use eye cream because I never noticed a difference. This eye cream is like giving your under eye a glass of water. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so refreshing and leaves my under eyes hydrated and makeup lays so much nicer on them now\\r\\nThis stuff feels so good and goes such a long way. I have been going through this tiny sample for such a long time. It feels great\\r\\nI have the sample size  But will be buying the full size as soon as I run out This seems like it helped with my fine lines and made some go away!. And it\\'s moisturize ur eyes very well my eyes never felt so smooth. You need this!!.!\\r\\nNever thought I would ever leave a review like this on an eye cream, but... this stuff is awesome. I actually NOTICE a difference after using this only a couple days. The fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable. It\\'s almost like this stuff plumps up the skin a bit. I look forward to continuing using this. I have NEVER used an eye cream that actually made a visual difference. This stuff is pricey but if you want something that really, truly works... try it out. I\\'ve used eye creams in the past simply for basic maintenance, and to keep my eyes hydrated.. But this here really actually makes a difference. The only con is that it has a rather thick consistency. It almost feels like putting Vaseline on your eyes, but not quite as thick as that. It does dry smooth but you can kinda feel it on your skin. This might be better suited as a night eye cream. Either way, it works. That\\'s what\\'s important.\\r\\nI have not mosturized until recently because no one told me how to like do it to my face but this has been great for a first timer like me. I love the feeling of it.\\r\\nI\\'ve been using this eye cream for about a month plus ans I must say that it\\'s become a fave! Got it at Sephora when I went in to restock on some old faves and I don\\'t regret it. Great under eye moisturizer, a bit \\'thick\\' but gel like..packed with moisture. My eyes certainly look less parched.\\r\\nI really love this moisturizer eye bomb. It is light weight but still very hydrating and refreshing feeling without feeling like you have too much product on your face\\r\\nI got this as a deluxe sample from Sephora and really enjoyed it. The cream is thick and hydrating but blends out well. No offensive smell. Overall a really solid eye cream.\\r\\nI received this in my Voxbox and am a big fan. I have puffy under eyes and this really helps keep it hydrated. I\\'ve seen a reduction in puffiness and the texture is so soft on my skin. I have been using patchology eye patches on top of the Eye bomb. I must say that this really has been helping my under eyes. My skin is not dry afterwards and when I put concealer on top, it goes on smoothly with no lines. I would recommend this product!\\xc2\\xa0 belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb \\r\\nWhen it comes to eye creams I am truly picky. Let me tell you this does not let you down. It provides superior hydration, quickly and it lasts! I use it as part of my night time regimine currently and then a micro dot in the morning under my makeup and I have not had any issues with mascara drop down or concealer creasing. These issues have plagued me FOREVER! If you are in need of a new eye cream do not hesitate to try this product. It definitely delivers!\\r\\nI\\'ve been looking for a moisturizer for my oily skin and this one succeeded my expectations. This moisturizer last me the whole day and it is perfect for use during this cold and windy temperature. I love it and would definitely keep using it! Thank u Influenster.\\r\\nIve been using this eye cream during the day under my makeup for about a week now and loving the results. The gel like texture is absorbed very quickly by my skin and holds nicely under light make up throughout the day without making be look shiny or greasy. I have combination/ oily skin therefore having a hard time finding day creams that really work for me. This product is perfect and recommend giving it a shot for a combination/ oily skin type that needs a little eye moisture through these cold dryer months of winter.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nReally nice moisturizing eye cream that can be used both during the day and at night! Very hydrating and can be worn under makeup if needed. This eye mask is also super smooth during application, def a must have!\\r\\nThis product is AMAZING. I received it complimentary in a VoxBox and I was skeptical because I never heard of belif\\'s brand. After using the product for a few weeks, I\\'m sold. A little bit goes a long way. It\\'s not too heavy and can be worn with makeup. There is definitely a difference in the skin around my eyes after these last few weeks of use. Worth the splurge!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI have eye allergies and this eye cream helps by moisturizing my undereye area and not causing me any allergies.  Amazing eye cream!\\r\\nThe Belif moisturizing eye bomb is perfect for active women like me. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t easy, but I spent about a week without drinking water to do a super test to this eye bomb, (don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try this at home kids) and WOW! This really works... when I used this moisturizer, my skin felt truly hydrated with a single use, and stayed healthy for two days and a half.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d recommend this eye cream any day and with my eyes closed (pun intended). IT REALLY WORKS! my skin is now hydrated, and looking healthier than ever (of course I started drinking water again) and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in love with the results using Belief USA @belifusa and, of course, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m definitely a customer now. I use the moisturizer and eye bomb everyday before doing my makeup routine. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS GIRL!!!\\r\\nI received this product from Influenster in a vox box and I love it! It is so hydrating under the eyes and feels so gentle. I find that it helps my undereyes less puffy. I really like the texture as I find it makes it feel much more hydrating than the cream I used before this (which was a much more watery texture)\\r\\nIn its first year of initiation, this gel eye cream was one of Sephora\\'s best offering eye creams, giving 26 hours of hydration while smoothing the fragile skin around the eyes. Incorporate it in your skincare prepare before applying concealer\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\'ll have a universe of an effect in your makeup look.\\r\\nReceived this in the vox box and loved it! Typically don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use an under eye cream just a face moisturizer. Adding this into my beauty routine is a must! My eyes feel bright when I wake up in the morning! Def recommend.\\r\\nLiterally obsessed. This cream is not oily or greasy at all. I can feel my skin soak up the moisture! I find that my make up goes on smoother and lasts longer. My skin feels amazing after using it for about a week. Definitely recommend.\\r\\nGot this thanks to Influenster and aaahhh i had just bought a new eye cream a week before hahaha but i absolutely love it. it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too heavy, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thick tho but it blends with the skin easily and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not oily either. I can wear it under my makeup easily too, my eyes feel hydrated and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a miracle with the san diego weather.\\r\\nDisclaimer: I received these creams via @influenster for review purposes.  I love that they have a nice scent and aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t greasy. I found them to be very refreshing.\\r\\nThis is a very hydrating eye cream that soaks in quickly and leaves that delicate skin looking youthful and healthy. Some eye creams seem useless but this one is very very nice. I will repurchase for the foreseeable future\\r\\nThere is a reason why this product is currently out of stock online at sephora-- it is truly amazing! I am a new belief-er! I was introduced to the eye bomb shortly after falling in love with their moisturizer. I normally use dr. brandt for under eye cream, and belif\\'s moisturizing eye bomb is on par with brandt\\'s. it is moisturizing, refreshing, and lightweight-- perfect under makeup for your morning routine. I did receive the eye bomb complimentary for sampling purposes, but will be purchasing!\\r\\nThis cream is light and feels nice, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a smell. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really noticed a difference however, even under my makeup. For the price point there may be other better options. I probably wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t purchase this again.\\r\\nMy favorite eye cream I\\'ve used up to date. My mom loves it too and says it\\'s been very moisturizing for her and myself as well. I love the way my skin feels after using it and I feel like it\\'s not too heavy (my eye area gets bumps when eye creams are too rich) but it\\'s just the right amount of moisturizing\\r\\nThis eye cream has been life changing for me! I just moved to Wyoming and the elevation and wind took a toll on my otherwise happy skin. Since I started using this I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed my under eye lines seemed to have reduced and my skin is no longer irritated and dry around my eye and on my kids. I will be giving one of these to my mom as a Christmas gift! You can find it at Sephora and they even have gift sets!\\r\\nI really love this lotion is amazing and the smell is perfect I recommend this lotion for anyone!\\r\\nI love this product!! Belif is always really great quality and it feels amazing on your skin. I received the product free for testing from Influnster. It is pretty gentle but super effective! It isn\\'t heavily scented either. I definitely recommend!\\r\\nLove love love this product, I have been using it for about two weeks and I feel like it has really moisturize my eye area and allowed my make up to stay on longer. I have somewhat sensitive skin and have no issues with this product, would recommend.\\r\\nAfter not knowing of this brand prior to receiving the belief Moisturizing Eye Bomb I have to say, Im pretty impressed! As Im in my early 30\\'s and really focusing on prevention, and eye cream is essential. This product absorbs quickly and make up application on top is flawless. Ive been using it every day and night now for 3+ weeks and have noticed a big improvement in hydration in my under eye area. (Especially with this dry winter weather) TRY IT, ITS GOOD! :) *I received this product complimentary for review purposes from Influenster\\r\\nI have always had tired eyes that bring me down. This product is amazing though. It keeps my eyes fresh and allows me to feel comfortable for a day on the town. Making sure you take care of the base is imperative for effective makeup doing. Would reccomend.\\r\\nI received this #complimentary from influenster a few days ago and so far I really like it. It feels hydrating, and normally I never can tell a difference with eye creams. I\\'ve used the moisturizer from the brand as well, and overall I love the line!\\r\\nAfter seeing how dry my under eyes were getting because of the cold weather I had to go pick this up from Sephora when I saw the reviews. It is indeed extremely moisturizing. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not too fond of the price on this little guy so I will not be repurchasing because it was moisturizing but it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t WOW me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not addicted to it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure I can find something a little better for the same price or even cheaper.\\r\\nJust started looking into other eye creams to possibly switch brands from what I use now, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m loving this brand. You only use a small two dabs, so this will last forever. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already been letting my friends try this and their moisturizer.\\r\\nI really like this product as it keeps your skin hydrated without leaving any sticky residue. For the price I would prefer to look for a cheaper alternative, but if you are willing to spend the money I would recommend it.\\r\\nIt really is the bomb! I love this eye cream and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something i keep needing to put on my eyes!\\r\\nI received this product for free for reviewing purposes.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only been like 2 weeks since I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve started using this product. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really say that I definitely see a difference with my under eyes.. But what I have noticed is it is a bit more hydrated now, which is much needed for me due to winter weather. Also, the skin under my eyes are really sensitive to a lot of products and causes my skin to get raw, red, and irritated. This product though, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that! And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hate it. But I think I still need to give it a bit more time to really see if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see any difference, anti-aging wise.\\r\\nI received this product as a free sample and I love it! I\\'ve been using it for a few weeks now and it\\'s my new go to eye cream. It\\'s super moisturizing and helps with my dark circles. I totally recommend it for any girl who loves to ensure their skin is moisturized and loves a good eye cream!\\r\\nI\\'m in love with this eye cream. I have extremely dry under eyes and if they can cause my concealer to look crepe-y if I don\\'t have a good under eye moisturizer on. This product solves that problem.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nI love belief products. You face/skin is left feeling s on refreshed and clean. The smell is also pleasant.\\r\\nMy favorite eye cream of all time! It\\'s thick enough to provide lasting hydration but still absorbent and lightweight!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m loving this eye cream. It has an almost gel cream consistency. It absorbs nicely into the under-eye and provides a ton of hydration. I use it both morning and night. Plus a little goes a long way!\\r\\nThis is a good eye cream for day or night! It is not super heavy underneath the eyes and hydrates well! Makeup goes on over it well.\\r\\nThis eye balm was just ok. I tried a small sample size, and it didn\\'t feel as potent as my Algenist eye cream, but it also didn\\'t last as long. I wonder if a full size would be better.\\r\\nThis was sent to me by Influenster and it is amazing. It depuffes my eyes left them feeling rejuvenated. I love that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a strong smell and that is water like cream. It is expensive but it is totally worth it.\\r\\nAdds so much hydration to the under eye area, takes crepey skin to smooth and depuffed in minutes! Love the gel like texture, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel to heavy on the eye at all. A lot of product for the price! Definitely would buy again\\r\\nI received this with my voxbox and I knew it was perfect for my skin during this time of year. It\\'s an eye cream full of hydration which is perfect because, although, I have oily skin, around my eye area, it\\'s dry. So I knew aright way I was going to love this product. I have been using it for the past two weeks or so and I love the results. My eye area isn\\'t looking so dry anymore which reduced the fine lines quite significantly. Thank you Influenster for letting me be part of this voxbox.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nIt was moisturizing, but I really didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice any difference in my fine lines. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably good if you just need moisture and not wrinkle care.\\r\\nHonestly I wasn\\'t too sure what to expect. I\\'ve been using eye creams  for years, because everyone told me I should. A little goes a LONG way  with this product. The first time I used it, I didn\\'t like it because I  couldn\\'t rub it all in and thought it was greasy. Second time around, I  used a tiny dab and it absorbed into my skin nicely. After using it a  few weeks, my under eye area looks and feels really healthy and  moisturized, so I guess it\\'s working! It has a fresh, eucalyptus scent  but it\\'s quite strong.\\r\\nI have been a fan of Belif for years now, so when I received the complimentary cream, I was beyond myself. As someone with sensitive skin, I loved that the scent was fresh and the texture was lightweight. I didn\\'t like that it left my skin looking glossy as I already have oily skin, but that\\'s based on preference! Overall, I would say it\\'s worth the price.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis is my first eye cream so I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t entirely sure what to expect when I received my sample from Influenster! I LOVE IT!  I never knew I needed it before but the moisturizing and firming under my eyes make my eye area look so much better! This is a great product!  My only other wish is that the product would come with some kind of pump versus the tub!\\r\\nWhen i first tested his product I had mixed feelings about it because it was pretty heavy. Usually I do my makeup after i finish applying my moisturizer so applying makeup after using this product isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that great because the color pigment will not come on and since it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oily the makeup just comes off. Would recommend for night time use but would have to find another product for the day time\\r\\nNice gel like consistency. Hydrated under eye area without disrupting makeup on top throughout the day. Bonus: the holiday set at Sephora comes with the full sized moisturizing bomb, this eye cream and a serum.. All for the price of the moisturizer. Definitely recommend!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this eye cream for the past month and I love how hydrating it makes my under eyes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super light weight and has a gel-like consistency.   It is used great with the true cream bomb by Belif.\\r\\nAfter using the aqua bomb I had to try the eye bomb...just as i expected ..my new fav eye cream! Not too heavy it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s smooth gel based but a different consistency than the aqua bomb it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing and my under eyes are very happy with me! Def notice it reduces my eye makeup settling in my fine lines, worth every penny!\\r\\nThis eye cream glides smoothly on your skin and is absorbed quickly. I like how it\\'s similar to a gel so it goes on my skin very easily and doesn\\'t tug that sensitive area. I\\'ve been wearing it during the day under makeup and at night. I\\'m not sure about results yet, but I really enjoy it at the moment. Some eye creams sting and cause redness, but this one is very gentle. I like it!\\r\\nThis product is good for moisturizing but I have not seen a difference in under eye lines, dark circles or puffiness. I got this product to sample from Influenster. It is light weight and has a nice scent.\\r\\nI think this eye cream is helping to eliminate some of my fine lines. I liked the Belif face moisturizer that also came in my voxbox. It\\'s a little expensive but if you are into eye creams give it a try.\\r\\nIn love! I received this product free to try through Influenster and couldn\\'t be happier with it. Over the last year or so I\\'ve suffered from dryness under my eyes and major dark circles. I brought this on Thanksgiving vacation with me and my skin looks AMAZING after a weeks use!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI received this product in my most recent Vox Box. I have seen it at Sephora but never felt particularly inclined to buy it because I have been using Clinique All About Eyes for years. I have to say I\\'m amazed. Reducing circles comes down to lifestyle habits (getting enough sleep, drinking lots of water and avoiding processed sugars, etc.) but also keeping your skin hydrated.\\xc2\\xa0I definitely feel this product hydrating my skin more than Clinique All About Eyes. It\\'s much lighter - almost like a smooth gel - than a cream. As for results - I\\'ve already noticed a reduction in lines after two weeks. I will be repurchasing.\\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nBelief products are some of my favorite face products because they don\\'t leave your face oily, but they coat your face to feel like it is full of moisture. It is a tad bit expensive, but it\\'s is well worth the money.\\r\\nthis eye bomb has an amazing smell is light as far as consistancy. i was very surprised in the product i wasnt expecting such a great product. The retail value is a bit pricy. its my first time using it so we will see how it goes after its gone if i notice a difference in my skin. but overall its a great product and i highly reccomend it\\r\\nLove this eye cream, it\\'s super gentle and completely depuffs my eye area. I have been using it for a week and noticed quite a difference in hydration and my fine lines around the eyes.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI absolutely love the Belif products and this eye cream is no different. It has a gel like consistency that absorbs quickly without feeling greasy. Makeup applies beautifully over the top of it. It also has a slight cooling effect. Great product overall! I received this product complimentary from Influenster, but the thoughts and review are my own.\\r\\nI love Belif Aqua Bomb, so I knew I would love this too! The gel formula is nice, and it makes my under eyes feel cooling and smooth and hydrated!\\r\\nSuper, super hydrating. I loved using this at night and waking up feeling dewy. If applying under/before makeup, use just a tiny bit, or let it completely set before applying makeup, otherwise it might get clumpy!\\r\\nI love this eye cream! It is very light feeling, however the moisture lasts for a long time. I live in an extremely dry climate and I have already noticed that my under eyes look brighter and firmer. My only complaint with other Belif products was that they seemed to cause my skin to become more oily, however this product seems to have found the perfect balance.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nBelif is my new favorite brand and this eye cream (along with the moisturizing face bomb) is my new crack. \\xc2\\xa0When it says it works for 24 hours it seriously doesn\\'t lie. \\xc2\\xa0I bought a small version of this in a gift kit which is amazing to travel with. \\xc2\\xa0My next skincare purchase will definitely be a full size of this eye cream.\\r\\nI recieved this for free and I love it they fill the container straight to the top. It is very moisturizing I use it at night and I little does go a long way. It\\'s an amazing eye cream I use my ring finger and pat it under my eye it does wonders.\\r\\nI loved this super moisturizing eye cream, at first i was using it only at night but when i read that it was perfect under makeup i decided lets try it! I fell in love! My concealer does not crease as much as before and it\\'s still easy to blend. I feel like for the price it\\'s really good!I did receive this for free to test out but this is my honest opinion.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI absolutely love this eye cream in the mornings! I pop it in my fridge every night. And when morning comes I get my coffee creamer and my eye cream. It rejuvenates my eyes for the day. Less puffiness, and hydrating to make my eyes plump. Great eye cream!!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis product is so hydrating and rejuvenating for the under eye area. I saw results overnight, and my skin looked noticeably healthier and less puffy under my eyes. Helped reduce inflammation as well. I would definitely repurchase this item!\\r\\nThis eye cream is amazing! It is very light and has a neutral smell. After using it 2x a day for 7 days, my eyes seem much more open and my under eye circles aren\\'t as noticeable. I\\'ve tried so many eye creams before and have always viewed them as my least favorite skincare item but the cream is going into my daily routine! I highly recommend it!  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb  I received this item for free from Influenster.\\r\\nThis product was an absolute dream in a bottle. I have very dry skin, and dry under eyes. Due to the dryness, my fine lines can be apparent. This has been working wonderfully. I am a makeup artist, I work in retail and I freelance as well. The fact that my concealer looked even better since using this product, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be any happier. I definitely haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t felt as if my eyes were dry at any point in the day. The texture is great too, not too heavy nor too light. I did receive this product for complementary for sampling purposes.\\r\\nI received this product complimentary from Influenster to test out, and I am enjoying it so much! The packaging is much different than what I\\'m used to for an eye cream, but I think it adds to its uniqueness. The product itself is amazing. The cream feels thick, but upon application, it feels super light-weight and absorbs well into the skin. It\\'s super hydrating, and my go-to eye cream!\\r\\nI\\'ve been seriously using this on a consistent basis since the day I received it and I LOVE IT- the texture is light and the results powerful. I\\'m noticing that my eye area is much more hydrated the next morning when I put my makeup on.\\xc2\\xa0 After trying so many eye cream products this one is a winner.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI have very sensitive combination skin and I absolutely love this product so much. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used it for a week and I have not broken out and have definitely seen the difference in my eyes! I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look as tired! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best.\\r\\nI am really enjoying this eye cream, I got this complimentary in my last voxbox, and I am really pleased by the hydration power and what it does to my undereye area. I have terrible dark circles, and moisturizing my undereyes is the key to improve the appearance, of this area, and this definitely does what it claims.\\r\\nI am obsessed! I love how moisturizing this eye cream is without leaving my skin feeling oily! I have been trying to find the perfect eye cream for a reasonable price and this one takes the cake because you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use much at all so the price by volume is totally worth it!\\r\\nI have been loving this product. It is so soothing and moisturizing. I have dry to normal skin so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been really helping especially with the colder weather. I also love the packaging  if only it had a pump!\\r\\nThis has become my #1 go to eye cream! It hydrates really well. I use it as my daytime and night time eye cream. I also use it before applying make up and it helps with smoothing my skin which makes concealer application last longer and stop any creasing. Smells amazing! A little goes a long way so this jar will definitely last you awhile.\\r\\nI received this product as a free sample, and over the last few years I have been struggling with extremely dried out and cracking skin as winter comes. I\\'ve tried lots of different products, but I can honestly say this is the most moisture surging cream I have put on my face. I have been using the Mario Badescu moisturizer before this one, but it is no where near as moisturizing as Belif\\xc2\\xa0 and I will definitely be switching over after this sample. Only after 3 days of using Belif I can tell a huge difference, and It doesn\\'t just moisturize when you apply but when you make up the next morning you can still feel the moisture bomb and my skin feels amazing! I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes, but this will be my next purchase at Sephora when my sample runs out.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb belif The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb \\r\\nShoutout to Influenster for sending me this VoxBox complimentary! I will be reviewing this product for testing purposes. Overall this is a fantastic eye cream for someone who is looking to give their eyes a moisture treatment. If you are feeling tired, dull, or dry during this winter, this product is perfect. I love the fragrance of the cream, it reminds me of a light fruity aroma. The cream itself leaves the eye area feeling smoothed out and ridden from any fine lines.\\r\\nI received this eye bomb complimentary for testing purposes and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so glad I did because I absolutely love it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightweight, a little goes a long way and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect under make up. There is so much product in the jar I imagine it will last a very long time\\r\\nI received this eye cream free in the recent VoxBox and holy cow it is amazing. I have yours is morning and night for three days but I could tell a difference instantly. It made my bags go down, my eyes seem brighter and my makeup went on smoother. It is just the right cooling effect to work but not feel uncomfortable or make your eyes water. It is light but so moisturizing that I can feel it the next morning after sleeping all night. A little goes a long way so you get a ton of bang for your buck. I will definitely be purchasing this when I run out!\\r\\nLooooved this eye cream. Seriously the first one I\\'ve ever used that I can still feel working the next day.\\r\\nI\\'ve been using this moisturizer for a few days now and I love it. It has a thick almost gel like consistency\\xc2\\xa0and feels very luxurious and a little goes a long way. I\\'ve actually got this on my lashes a couple times by accident and it didn\\'t irritate my eyes at all so I think it would work well for those with sensitive eyes. Also, I love how well makeup applies over this. My skin just drinks this up, so I wait a couple minutes after applying the cream and then apply my makeup as usual. The cream give the makeup a nice base to glide over and doesn\\'t pill at all. If you have dry or dehydrated skin around the eyes definitely give this a try or pick up a sample of it from sephora.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nMost of the puffy tiredness look is gone! 5 days using and im absolutely loving the results. Definitely recommend!\\r\\nI am absolutely amazed at how WELL this works! It smells amazing and keeps all my dry area well hydrated. My skin feels soft and smooth. I like the way it looks too. It feels like there may be some mint in it, i love it!\\r\\nI received this eye cream to try and it\\'s knocked every other eye cream i\\'ve been using off my vanity for the time being.This product really does moisturize more than any other one i\\'ve been using. You can tell when you put it on that your skin just soaks it up and is much softer and brighter after using. With winter coming, this is the just the cream my skin needs. I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes.\\r\\nThis cream is really good! I don\\'t use often a cream for eyes area and during this winter I know that our skin needs more attention. So I started to use it and my skin feels so soft right now! The packing is too beautiful and the design is really good. I definitely would recommend it to my friends\\r\\nThis stuff is what dreams are made of. Light and creamy to the touch. Makes you feel refreshed and hydrated. In love with this product! Disclaimer: I received this product for free from Influenster for reviewing purposes\\r\\nI love this eye cream! Very moisturizing! Lasts a long time. Large jar. Good value! Can be purchased at Sephora. I use nightly\\r\\nAmazing gel eye cream. I love this brand! Light weight formula with amazing smell. Feels like a gel. Looks, smells and feels just like the true cream aqua bomb gel moisturizer but has different products in the formula to smooth eyes, soothing them, depuffing and brightening. This cream is perfect for at night on the eye. Very moisturizing and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bother my oily eyelids from the formula. Packaging is cute and sleek. Amazing product and easy to apply and use. Would recommend this product to anyone in the market for an amazing eye cream. Will repurchase from Sephora. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where I got the first one, bout to pick up my second container soon. Loving this formula!\\r\\nThis eye cream is right on par with another eye cream I\\'ve been using for about 2 years. The old one is twice as much money for 3/4ths of the product. Only thing I prefer about it is that it comes in an airtight pump. This one comes in a pot which concerns me when it comes to sanitation and quality of ingredients. I am very glad this one didn\\'t give me any milia issues and it didn\\'t sting at all. Sometimes my lashes get in the way and it can burn, but not this eye cream! I really appreciate getting to try this out and can\\'t wait to see what happens after using it for a month or so! So far it\\'s just been very moisturizing, not sure it\\'s supposed to help dark circles but it may! We will see. I am very hopeful that this will be my new eye cream! Came right when I ran out of the old one :)\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nI didn\\'t expect that I\\'d love this product so much! It\\'s smells good, has smooth texture, moisturizing my eyes well and I fell so fresh after using it! It\\'s perfect eye cream before your makeup routine.\\r\\nI received this in the Belif Vox Box and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in love, I have puffy dry under eyes and this allows me to wake up with smooth under eyes that concealer doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fall off of during the day!\\r\\nTotally in love with this product! I received this as a sample to review and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m SO impressed! My eye area looks brighter, softer and healthier after just a couple of uses! And a little goes a long way, so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to use this for a long time!\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too thick and not too thin, perfect consistency. Has a light lemon ish scent but not strong at all. My face is feeling plump and moisturized after using this, and it is defined needed for these winter months.\\r\\nWhat a nice eye treat!  My friend has gotten this cream at Sephora and swears by it!! This eye cream has a jelly cooling texture. . A little of it  goes a long way. It feels very moisturizing and satisfying especially now that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting colder , also super light and absorbs deep into my skin! 5 star. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\\r\\nAbsolutely hands down the best eye cream I have ever used! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m an exhausted mom to 3 little boys and this feel so luxurious on my eyes! I will never buy another eye cream again!\\r\\nThis is the best moisturizer for dry skin. I was a little hesitant to try it because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a cream..but it is amazing! Since purchasing my first one I had to buy another for a backup!  Definitely would buy again!   #belif\\r\\nIt is the most hydrating eye cream ever. It transformed my under eye in about two weeks. Fine lines less visible. Just love it!!!\\r\\nThis eye cream helps with moisturizing the eye area and helps keep skin elasticity around the eye area. This eye cream is not specifacly for eye wrinkles, belif makes another eye cream for that but I did notice it did help with some eye creases around my eyes. I got this at Sephora for $48 but it lasts a long time. Ive had it for 6 months and it\\'s still has a lot of product in it. It\\'s a thick white cream and I dot it around my eye area with my pinky, never rub. It\\'s instantly moisturzes on contact and basically keeps moisturizing till I wash my face the next day. It does not irritate my eyes at all and I notice the area around my eyes are softer and look more plump.\\r\\nLITERAL HOLY GRAIL! i heard good things about this product and received minis at GenBeauty! I use this everyday and is gentle on my skin. i did notice a change in the area underneath my eyes an the results were great!\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nIt hydrates under my eyes perfectly and helps make my baggy eyes in the morning less noticeable. It makes me feel very comfortable in my skin!\\r\\nExcellent eye cream, it does what it describes. Extreme hydration that last more than 24 hrs, work prefectly under make up but make sure to late it dry at least 10 minutes! I recommend this product to people in their 20s\\r\\nOne word .....AMAZING !!!!! I love this eye cream it feels so good on the skin and it makes you look awake and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hydrating\\r\\nI have tried several eye products from high end to drug store ones...This one certainly helps to moisturize the eye area making the under eye area really hydrated.\\r\\nI received this in a free sample. After washing my face one night tried it out before bed! Oh man! I literally went to the store the next day to get the full size. I love this product. It makes my under eyes feel hydrated, it is SO smooth. The only thing I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like is that I feel the packaging is deceiving. The container is so much bigger but not a lot of product. However, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use much. I definitely recommend this, I wish I had this product in my life sooner.\\r\\nI really loved this line as a facial moisturizer so when I found out they had an eye cream, I had to go for it! It has the same gel, cooling feel as the face moisturizer. I noticed that the skin around my eyes was a lot smoother and softer. Very nice feel!\\r\\nI got a couple of samples of this in Sephora orders and I absolutely love it. It\\'s so hydrating. I have very sensitive skin and I haven\\'t had any reaction to this, unlike a lot of other eye creams I\\'ve tried. I will definitely be purchasing the full size when my trial sizes run out.\\r\\nHoly vats of amazing eye cream, Batman!\\xc2\\xa0 This stuff is destined to become a cult favorite.\\xc2\\xa0 I was extremely dehydrated and my eyes were showing it in a huge way...dry and showing every single line.\\xc2\\xa0 My eyes were aging me by 5 years that day...but luckily that was the same day this little blue pot of glory arrived from Sephora.\\xc2\\xa0 One tiny dab with my ring finger under each eye and my skin instantly plumped and softened AND it stayed that way for 24 hours.\\xc2\\xa0 No joke.\\xc2\\xa0 I awoke the next day with eyes softer than a silk.\\xc2\\xa0 Color me a carp (bad fish analogy...sorry) because Belif Eye Bomb caught me - hook, line and sinker.\\xc2\\xa0 I will totally buy this for the coming dry winter months.\\r\\nJust like all the other Belif products I love this! Very light but very moisturizing! It smells just like the aqua bomb moisturizer which I definitely don\\'t mind. The tiniest bit goes a very long way so this jar will last a long time.    I highly recommend this product.\\r\\nUltra moisturizing, this cream satiates skin with lush hydration for lasting smoothness and firming. I love that it doesn\\'t have an  overwhelming fragrance and didn\\'t irritate my sensitive skin. While the moisture is very intense, it was rich without being greasy, and didn\\'t cause my makeup to smudge or wear differently over it.\\r\\nThis is another sample I obtained from Sephora.\\xc2\\xa0 I\\'m happy to report with this second Belif sample I\\'m an official \"Belif-er\"!\\xc2\\xa0 This helps retain moisture and makes my undereye look really nice (when it\\'s usually dark and saggy.)\\xc2\\xa0 Creamy texture without leaving skin dewy, and slightly brightening!\\r\\nI found my new eye cream! Helps to reduce any dark circles and very smooth while applying under eyes and keeps hydrated and helps with fine lines.\\r\\nThis eye gel is an amazing lightweight gel with a super smooth application and a hydration punch that makes me look like I\\'ve had 10 hours of sleep when I\\'m only running on 4.\\xc2\\xa0If you like BELIF\\'s True Aqua Bomb, then this eye cream is right up your alley.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nEsta crema de ojos es perfecta para personas de piel normal a grasa. Tengo undereye seco e hidrata pero no como yo quisiera\\r\\nMy go to eye cream! I have to be careful with products since I am prone to getting milia under my eyes. This is the perfect texture, feels so good on the skin and isn\\'t heavy! They call it moisturizing bomb for a reason! I would highly recommend this product!!\\r\\nWhich skin type is it good for? Normal Oily Combination Dry Sensitive This lightweight, refreshing eye cream floods fine lines with 26 hours of moisture, boosts elasticity, and increases resilience of skin for flawless makeup application. Solutions for:- Dryness- Fine lines and wrinkles- Loss of firmness and elasticityIf you want to know more\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Formulated with hydrating herb, comfrey leaf, and elasticity-boosting pennywort herb, the Moisturizing Eye Bomb provides a flood of intensive moisture for radiant and youthful-looking eyes.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nThis moisturizer dis wonders for my under eyes. I don\\'t get nearly enough sleep, so I find my eyes look \"worn\" lately. This improves the appearance instantly. The lines under my eyes look less noticeable and darkness /puffiness subsides. I had a sample last me 2 months using it every day! I bought the full size and after about 3 months my hereditary curse has greatly reduced\\r\\nI love this cream it is a very good moisturizer it\\'s not to pricey it lasts a while to\\r\\nThis eye balm is like a dream. It is so effective at keep my eye lids and under eyes hydrated which becomes an issue during summer season. I enjoy the colors and simple packaging. I would most definitely buy again!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m always a fan of kbeauty and skincare and this belif eye cream is amazing! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so light and hydrating so it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel clogging or heavy at all. The fresh is so amazing and really awakens you. Restock!\\r\\nJust like with the aqua bomb I am in love. I have sensitive skin and around my eyesight can be worse but this was just moisturizing heaven. I have already added it to my routine. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb #influensterawards #contest @Influenster\\r\\n'}"

      "Line1: Well, eye cream. I felt like it was a waste of money to be very honest. Having never used an eye cream before, except for my eye stick, I felt like I wasn't going to use it, but wasn't I wrong?!I brought this one to my dorm actually, so that I could use it there. Its a cute sample size. But it makes my eyes feel so hydrated!!!This eye cream has a rather strong herbal scent, which might not appeal to everyone. If you've already tried the Aqua Bomb, you're most likely already familiar with the scent. It's almost the same. I personally stop smelling it once it has absorbed into the skin. I don't mind the scent too much, but I get that others might not like it.The texture is very creamy and lightweight, and it sinks in really quickly. it does leave somem sort of balmy texture behind though, but you only notice it when you touche it with your finger. It makes my skin smooth and hydrated. I am a big fan!\n",
      "Line2: This product is amazing I have the worst under eye circles and this cream has helped moisturize my eye continuously. I love the belief products and I highly recommend using them!\n",
      "Line3: Me encantó. Recibí este producto en formato tester por mis compras en ULTA y luego de leer reseñas, le di una oportunidad. OMG, increíble. Mi contorno de ojos era súper seco y con finas líneas, ahora se siente hidratado, suave y el maquillaje luce mucho mejor. Lo recomiendo!!\n",
      "Line4: I recently ran out of the Lancôme genifique eye cream that I’d been using for the last 3ish months (which I LOVED), so I decided to try this sample I got from Ulta. This Belif eye cream is amazing!!! It’s thick, creamy and super hydrating. A little bit goes a long way, I was able to use this sample packet for 4 days, including the first day where I used enough to moisturize my entire face! 😂🤦🏼‍♀️ It doesn’t have a scent really at all and it’s very gentle, so I think it would be fine for all skin types.  This eye cream retails at $48 for 0.84oz so it’s super affordable (compared to the Lancôme eye cream, which this is 100% a dupe for). I would absolutely purchase and recommend this to anyone!\n",
      "Line5: Yesss this is a great eye cream. It is hydrating and the texture is a gel cream. Feels super nice on the eye area. I like to use this as a cooling eye cream, so i store this in the fridge. Works wonders :)\n",
      "Line6: Another sample I got and purchased the full size after. This is my go to eye cream and the full size jar will last you forever! Good price for a great product. It helps with bags and under eye discoloration as well as those fine lines you get with mature skin. Definitely recommend\n",
      "Line7: It's actually pretty nice as far as eye creams go. I find most to be useless but this one really was moisturizing. I dont think id buy the full size though because although it caused me no irritation, the smell I find to be really off putting. Its  got a citrus scent but in a cleaning product kind of way.\n",
      "Line8: I received this product for free from Influenster and Belif in exchange of my honest review. I've been using belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb for more than a week and I already notice a difference on my eyes especially my undereye. It's lightweight and it moisturize my underye. I noticed that it lightens the darkness e too. I like using it in the morning before putting concealer.\n",
      "Line9: I received this in my first Allure Beauty Box. I love how unbelievably moisturizing this formula is! It includes ceramides, oat extract, willow bark extract, and squalane (amongst others) which all combine to create a literal moisturizing bomb for my under eyes. My issue with this, and why I have deducted two stars, is that this product has Citrus Autrantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citral, Citronellol, Limonene, and several more ingredients that can be irritating to some people. All of these ingredients are completely unnecessary, and I hope that in the future they make a version that is free of irritating fragrance and oils for those of you out there who can’t use (or just don’t enjoy) fragranced products! I also am a firm believer that an eye cream is just a repackaged and overpriced moisturizer, occasionally with some mica thrown in it to reflect light and make the under eyes look brighter. Find a great moisturizer, and use that under your eyes and it will be just as beneficial.\n",
      "Line10: Belif really does know how to do hydration! This moisturizer is super gentle and you’ll see an instant glow!\n",
      "Line11: This eye cream it’s really a bomb, you can feel freshness in your eyes immediately after you put this eye cream\n",
      "Line12: I really didn’t think it was possible for me to like any Belif brand products until now. All of their gel moisturizers leave a sticky film on my skin and don’t seem to absorb. The Moisturizing Eye Balm is different though. It absorbs well into my skin and the gel hydrates my eye area big time, but without leaving a weird film on my skin. This isn’t my absolute favorite eye cream of all time, but it’s still a good product.\n",
      "Line13: This Korean Skincare Brand is a popular little gem and for good reason. It has soothing tiger grass & oat kernel extract as well as inflammation-fighting comfrey leaf to comfort your tierd and puffy eyes along with darkened spots. The cooling formula is also packed with glycerin and squalane which instantly softens stressed skin. Worked awesome for my poor stressed eyes!\n",
      "Line14: This moisturizing eye bomb is the bomb!! I love that a bit goes a long way. You don’t need to use a lot of the product! It smells very citrusy and it’s light and gentle to your skin. Very hydrating! belif\n",
      "Line15: I’ve tried many different eye creams and this one is my favourite! I love how hydrating if feels and how much more bright it looks under my eyes!! Definitely recommend!!\n",
      "Line16: Excellent product. Very kind to skin and shows improvement of under eye impurities. So far I’m very satisfied with this product. I use this in conjunction with the belif moisturizer.\n",
      "Line17: A lightweight but powerful moisturizing eye cream. Fights premature aging, diminishes existing fine lines, and is cooling. I deducted a star because I feel as though this product is over priced ($48 at Sephora).\n",
      "Line18: This eye cream was nice although it does have more of a thicker texture so I’m not sure people with oily skin would like that but it was great for my dry skin so I did enjoy using it but I feel like I could get the same feel and result from something a bit more affordable. I’d recommend it if you’d want to try it but personally I wouldn’t purchase the full size of this.\n",
      "Line19: This is one of my favorite brand and I really like this moisturizing eye bomb. This is perfect for my eyes. It feels like water has kissed my under eyes. This is really perfect 💙💙 I would recommend.💦💦💦\n",
      "Line20: The eye cream is amazing. Currently, It’s a top favorite of mine because it really does seem to brighten and de-puff my under eyes. I also enjoyed how the balm left a really nice cooling sensation. I’m able to use it 360 degrees around my eye and not have any sensitivity either. It definitely is tightening and brightening. Thanks Influenster for sending this to me to try.\n",
      "Line21: I received a sample of this with a Sephora purchase and fell in LOVE. It's hydrating and gentle enough for my sensitive eyes. There wasn't enough product in the sample for me to use it long enough to tell if it made a difference with my dark circles, but I will definitely purchase a full size jar when I get the chance!\n",
      "Line22: I received this Voxbox from influenster to sample a couple of burst of hydration creams with glowing skin effects. The belif aqua bomb brightener smells citrusy and the eye bomb both blend well into the skin. The textures are creamy and can be used at any time of the day. I am into products that have a clean smell and that contain vitamins in the products. I recommend these products after showering to avoid an over greasy feeling on the skin. The eye bomb does not have any smell and took a couple of days before I noticed an ease of my laugh lines.\n",
      "Line23: I love the coolness and ease which this cream applies. It really does what it claims to do. The scent is really pleasant and i would ABSOLUTELY purchase and truly recommend\n",
      "Line24: Loved this product! I received a complimentary sample size, this eye bomb is so moisturizing! It’s gentle and soothing. It has a cool and cold tingly feeling, which is so nice in the morning it helps wake me up! I love this product and it has became a staple in my skincare routine!\n",
      "Line25: I love this eye cream. It is probably one of the best that I have ever tried! I got a small sample size complementary from Influenster however I am so impressed with how little product do you need for each application. You just need the tiniest amount on your finger and it covers your under eyes as well as extra to put on your eyelid. This is really nice because it is an expensive product however I do think if you were to buy it it would last you a really long time. I also really enjoy how this product makes my under eyes feel. It does have that water-based feel which is really nice and it has not clogged my pores which is very important to me however it’s also so incredibly hydrating.\n",
      "Line26: I liked instant moisture and hydration this cream provided, and kept my eye area hydrated all day. IMO, this eye cream is good for a quick moisturizing fix.  The cream is lightweight, smooth, which makes the application effortless, it has a very mild not artificial scent, I like that there are herbs in the ingredients (comfrey leaf, tiger grass). Also it is free of mineral oils/petrolatum ,but I see it still has alcohol, which is \"a no\" for me. Besides, last time I checked Belief was not cruelty-free,...still?\n",
      "Line27: This stuff makes my eyes feel so refreshed ! I love using it after I clean my face and moisturize. I even like using it when I feel sleepy in the day. Come on cold and smooth almost like an aloe feeling .\n",
      "Line28: I received this in my allure beauty box~ I am already a fan of the Belief products. This did not disappoint! It goes on beautifully and makes the under eye feel great. I will be purchasing a regular size. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line29: It hydrates very well, easy to spread under your eye. I’m not sure if it helps with elasticity. The other one is good too.\n",
      "Line30: Love this stuff! Got this as a sample thanks to Sephora. Loved the consistency so much, I started using it as my nightly facial moisturizer. Now I don’t really notice much in the way of improvement around my eyes (lines or wrinkles, but I don’t have many to start with)... But I find the value in its moisturizing abilities. It leaves my skin incredibly supple, I wake up and still feel that my skin is hydrated. I’m going to try their regular face bomb cream before I buy, cuz $48 for full size bottle (.84oz) is a little spendy and I want to see which one is better since this one isn’t really marketed as a full face cream 🙃\n",
      "Line31: The best eye cream I've ever used.  I use it every night. It keeps my eyes moisturized. I wake up feeling more refreshed and my under eyes are less dry and tired. I have sensitive eyes and It doesn’t cause irritation. So happy with this product. Definitely worth it! Highly recommend it!  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line32: Definitely recommend well moisturizer keeps your skin hydrated and makes your skin glow ￼\n",
      "Line33: This is the best eye cream that I have tried at the moment. I have been searching for an eye cream that really moisturizes and refreshes this area for so long without results. But with this one, it really makes the difference.\n",
      "Line34: I loved the products. This cream leaves your skin super beautiful, very well hydrated and gives a rich smell, when passing over your face you feel that it relieves you and gives an immediate warning #belifHydrationHeroes #contest #complimentary @belifusa @belifcanada @Influensterbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line35: I recieved this sample in one of my monthly subscription boxes. I've tried several different eye creams and this one fell short for me. If you just need a moisturizer for your under eye area, this us great. However, I have dark circles and puffiness so I prefer products that have ingredients that correct these issues. Not terrible, just not for me.\n",
      "Line36: I love these eye cream my eye lids are very dry but these cream makes my eyes feel and look very moisturized during the day. I’m definitely getting the normal size.\n",
      "Line37: If you’re looking for an eye cream, you’re either 1. adding it to your routine, or 2. starting to notice serious lack of hydration during makeup sessions. In allll honesty I thought my eyes were maybe aging pretty bad, but few weeks in and the lines have minimally reduced, my concealer is starting to look at its best again. Moisture is essential to the skin, this is definitely a bomb of hydration. It exceeded my expectation because I thought maybe it was a hyped product, specially with its reasonable price. I was even more impressed at the amount of product in the mini sample, all you need is a dab!\n",
      "Line38: Eye creams aren't necessary for my routine, but I do enjoy a nice one when they come my way. This is my first time I used a Belif product and I really enjoyed this. The cream is lightweight and glides on skin. There is fragrance in this product and I was a little anxious, but my eyes experienced no redness or irritation from this. For those that are curious about scent, this has a light citrus smell.   I would caution sensitive skin types and those that may have irritated skin to avoid this or wait until your skin repairs itself. I didn't realize I had a small cut on my hand and this cream made my skin red and sensitized only on that spot which is how I found out.  After using this for a few days, I really have come to enjoy this, but it is too pricey for me. If you need an eye cream, I would look elsewhere since the price makes this not worth it. However, if you get it as a gift or free sample I would recommend trying it out since it sinks so nicely in the skin.\n",
      "Line39: This eye cream tightened the skin around my eyes right away after the first time use. It is light and does not have strong odor. It is also made in Korea which definitely adds some points😃\n",
      "Line40: This is a nice daytime eye cream. It moisturizes well and has a light, fresh fragrance (eucalyptus, maybe?). It reduces puffiness and tingles a little when I put it on, which is actually kind of nice in the morning! I haven't seen much difference in terms of fine lines and wrinkles, but it's solidly in the rotation! ✨👍  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line41: My absolute favorite eye cream of all time and I have tried so many!  I love that a little goes a long way and that no matter what the amount is that I apply, every application feels luxurious.  No scent and clean!  Wake up to youthful and supple hydrated eyes.  At 37, this cream is my fountain of youth.  Worth the price!\n",
      "Line42: This eye cream is great for both day and night! It’s great for day because it works well under makeup, but it’s also hydrating enough for night time. I usually use separate eye creams for day and night, but this one is great for travel because I only need to bring this one! I also have really dry undereyes and eyelids that are eczema prone, so a really moisturizing eye cream is a must for me. The only con for me is that it smells too much like fresh ginger (and I don’t really like ginger lol).\n",
      "Line43: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb yes product is amazing I love the way it feels under my eyes. Wish there was a little bit more, Love the smell, The texture feels amazing, I would definitely purchases. ￼￼￼￼￼￼\n",
      "Line44: This eye cream is light and soft. It absorbs into my skin extremely quick and it doesn’t leave a greasy feeling. I love it. Some eye cream would give me pimple but this doesn’t.\n",
      "Line45: I don’t feel this product works on me. I use it and I don’t see any change on my under eyes bags.\n",
      "Line46: This is a great moisturizer for underneath the eye area. I will say that this is not an anti aging eye cream but highly hydrating for someone like me who suffers from dry skin underneath the eyes. I apply this with my facial moisturizer and let it settle into my skin before applying makeup so this eye gel really helps make my concealer look a little more fresh. I would totally repurchase and use this as my day eye cream for extra hydration.\n",
      "Line47: I love how it hydrates the contour of my eyes, its content is very good since it has hyaluronic acid and vitamins c and e, it does not irritate at all and does not burn, they even lowered the tone of the dark circles a bit\n",
      "Line48: Awakens & refreshes the skin! This truly is like a drink of water for your face. I have dry skin especially during the summer so I appreciate the hydration this product provides and a little bit goes a long way. It sort of reminds me of tarte Drink of H2O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer. To be honest I will definitely be retiring that and using this instead.   This product gives a healthy, youthful glow And I trying believe it helps improve the appearance of lines & wrinkles. Its lightweight & non-greasy plus it helps soften & plump skin's appearance. It ensures smooth makeup application, no pilling. #hydrationhero #contest #complimentary @belifusa @belifcanada @Influenster\n",
      "Line49: I received this first as a sample in an Ipsy bag I believe. I really enjoy this product! It is full of fragrance, so be wary if that is an issue; however, it does smell really good! It has a wonderful texture, somewhere in-between a gel and a cream. It is gentle and leaves your eyes feeling hydrated and soft. It doesn’t get tight like some eye creams can, especially ones that are meant to help with puffiness or under-eye bags. It isn’t greasy at all either, it soaks in nicely.\n",
      "Line50: 💧Refreshing and cooling  💧smooths fine lines 💧Increases elasticity  💧Helps to reduce fine lines 💧Brightens under eye area 💧Free from artificial dyes 💧Suitable for everyone\n",
      "Line51: Great product for eye lid hydration. It says to use on bottom of the eye but I use for both. A minuscule amount is fine, as it glides on smooth.\n",
      "Line52: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb it's part of my night skincare, this is a sample and I have lasted a lot, with little appliance product on both sides, it's light, refreshing, helping to decrease the lines and wrinkles of low eyes, no fragrances or parabenes.\n",
      "Line53: I received these products for free from Influenster and belif in exchange for my honest review.  I thought this eye cream was okay... it added moisture, but I didn’t see or feel any other benefits. It’s not worth the price point, in my opinion. I like my eye creams to have additional benefits, like helping with dark circles or reducing puffiness and this didn’t have anything like that.  I wouldn’t purchase this eye cream.\n",
      "Line54: This is one of my all time fave eye creams. It cools and deflates dark circles and puffiness. It really helps to ease the signs of under eye stressors. I personally love it and think you will, too! I would purchase this again.\n",
      "Line55: Good, solid eye cream. Smells good, fees good going on, absorbs fast. The gel consistency is good for summer, but probably not thick enough for winter.\n",
      "Line56: I have tried many different Belif products and I haven't found one that I didnt love. I've already gone through a couple small containers of the eye bomb. I'm lucky to keep getting samples.  It's very moisturizing yet light at the same time. I really like this product.  It also smells great.\n",
      "Line57: I liked this a lot. I love how it hydrates my under eyes and fade away the dark circles. It also has a slight cooling feeling when applying that feels refreshing. And it’s lightweight\n",
      "Line58: This really gives u some intense moisture around ur eyes and makes the puffyness from ur eyes go down as well. I only had to use a very small amount to cover my eye and so I know this small little samle will last me for a good amount of time since u dont have to use a lot. It has a small smell to it and I cant put my finger on it kind of a botanical smell with a hint of tee tree.\n",
      "Line59: Excelente producto para el contorno de ojos, lo recibí en una caja de sephora play y no he pasado de cómpralo. Funciona bien. Reduce líneas de expresión, se siente muy hidratante\n",
      "Line60: I liked.  Refreshing, absorbs well, won't build up or flake, can be worn under makeup, and it really works.  I am really obsessed.  I wear it multiple times a day without excessive build-up.  It is so refreshing and charming.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line61: incredible how every part of our body or skin needs a little care.  With this product under my eyes I keep well hydrated and soft and I even feel that the dark circles of my dark circles diminished.  highly recommended. Complimentary\n",
      "Line62: I'd give this 4½ stars! I got this with my may allure beauty box. I had gotten a deluxe sample of  belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb  which has dye and a heavy perfume fragrance and I couldn't use it so I wasn't sure about this. But this is great. It doesn't have the blue dye and it has a light scent, like Gillette men's original shaving cream. It fades quickly though which I appreciate. This is soothing and didn't irritate the delicate skin around my eyes. It absorbs fully but is still really hydrating and long lasting. I think it might have helped with the redness under my eyes, but I'm not sure.  It's a good day eye cream for me for the summer. But the skin around my eyes is so dry this isn't enough for me and I prefer  Kiehl’s Avocado Eye Cream . However I really enjoyed trying this and it changed my opinion on belief products. While I wouldn't purchase because it's not quite what I need, if you're someone who wants a long lasting, moisturizing eye cream without the heavy feel this is a good fit. It's $48 for 0.84oz, but unfortunately that's pretty typical of what you have to pay for a good eye cream. It's comparable to the kiehls.\n",
      "Line63: Complimentary from influenster, I really love this product because my eyes feel very hydrated and plump.\n",
      "Line64: Yep! Love this one! Its really creamy texture melts right into my skin leaving a silky smooth finish. I can use this day (underneath makeup) or night. I recommend this eye cream. 💋\n",
      "Line65: I rarely saw any difference at my skin when i used other moisturizers or serums. But with this one change was noticeable in a few days . My under-eye area is brighter and it softened my wrinkles . I will definitely buy a full-size of this one belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line66: Excellent product for the eye contour, softens the skin and leaves a pleasant smell ❤️\n",
      "Line67: smells nice, definitely recommend putting this product on before bed & a little goes a long way. I saw a slight decrease in dark circles which is always nice. no noticeable “glow” though, as some might look for in an eye product. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line68: I've been using this eyecream for a week now, and I've noticed some changes on my undereye. It lightens and moisturize my undereye, I love it because it's a lightweight and you can't feel it on your eyes it's a little bit sticky but it's fine. 😉 You can notice the changes if you swipe 👉🏻  it's 11 in the  evening here I tried my best to edit these on still natural color, but I can't adjust the product 😅  #belifinhydration #contest #complimentary @belifusa @influenster\n",
      "Line69: I received this product on my VoxBox campaign, it's been two weeks that I'm applying it every night before going to bed and I have to say, I haven't seen a huge improvement in hydration. So, yes, it's not great. Specially for the price. #skincare #eyebomb #voxbox #summer #eyes #springintosummer #springintosummervoxbox\n",
      "Line70: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb This is a very refreshing and light eye cream. The scent is quite different than what I’m used to. I think it’s the tiger grass that gives more of a eucalyptus scent. It’s more of a natural origin fragrance. It’s very soothing and cooling on my skin. I like it for the daytime and the warm weather because it’s not heavy or greasy but hydrates and soothes. It’s great for before my concealer and puffiness.\n",
      "Line71: Just finished off a travel size of this. I got a good amount of uses out of it. I used it consecutive days in a row and I can definitely tell a difference of my under eyes. They look brighter and my under-eye lines seem to be less noticeable. I have another eye cream to use next but if I were to need an eye cream during the next Sephora sale I might just pick it up!\n",
      "Line72: I got a sample of this in an Ipsy bag and I was lucky enough to to get in a VoxBox for review now, too! The tiniest amount of this goes a long way so don’t be discouraged by size/price! I was looking for something that that would help with dark circles under my eyes, but was wowed by the change in the skin texture on my upper lids. Not sure if it helped with my circles (most are from allergies and thin skin/prominent dark veins though), but it completely transformed my upper eyelids. Really plumped and helped with some crepey skin I didn’t even realize was a problem. Noticed a difference in eye makeup application within days. Awesome product!\n",
      "Line73: The belif Moisturizing eye bomb is perfect for those who suffer of a dry eye area and those who want to improve the look and get rid of fine lines. After using this eye cream for about three weeks I feel like im qualified to speak about this product. The belif Moisturizing eye bomb applies beautifully under the eye and absorbs nicely into the skin leaving a great finish, free of residue and ready for makeup application. It is recommended to massage the product around the eye area as usual with the ring fingers and is suggested to pat the product along the contours of the eye which is great! To me the contours of the eye is the orbital bone and not many eye creams are meant to be used in the upper eye area. I have especially been enjoying that because I feel like my eyelids had been looking a bit wrinkly. I found that after using this eye cream the elasticity in my lids has significantly improved. The feeling of the cream on the skin is smooth and cooling giving the eyes the perk that is much needed in the mornings. I am pleased to say that the eye cream does great all day long, it truly keeps the eye looking smooth and hydrated for the day. A problem I have ran into with other eye creams is that they seem to not absorb properly into the skin and cause my concealers to move and crease. This belif Moisturizing eye bomb  does not do that at all, it sits perfectly and works great under my makeup. Although this product delivers moisture to eye immediately to the skin I suggest using it daily for long lasting and continuous results. I rate the belif eye cream a 5 stars out of 5.  I feel that all belif’s claims are true and would recommend this product to you.  I hope that if you were debating on this product my review helped you make your choice. I do want to again disclose that I received this product complementary for testing purposes from belif and Influenster.

      "Line74: This little eye cream is amazing, I didn't pay much attention to the skin around my eyes and that's why I had my skin dry and my make-up didn't fit perfectly. However, as soon as I applied this cream, I had results from the first day. The skin is moisturized, soft and elastic all day long. Most importantly, it is comfortable and easy to put in even a small bag.\n",
      "Line75: I have used many eye cream and I really loved this one. It’s very creamy and I love massaging this under my eye. I can definitely say it’s very moisturizing and it feels great under the eye. The packaging stay it gives moisture for 26 hours but I didn’t really try for 26 hours but I did for 17 hours and it does show a great result. I apply it in the morning before I put on any makeup and I do apply it before going to sleep as well. Also, this one makes your make up stays under the eye really well and it doesn’t crease at all. I have received this in my #springintosummer voxbox from influenster and it’s really refreshing and it works magically.\n",
      "Line76: This product is amazing. I got a sample of this product and now I'm thinking to buy a full size. My under eye skin feels so hydrated and smooth. Also I noticed that skin become more elasticity and I love it. Because of reach formula it helps to use a small amount every time and it doesn't leave a grease feeling on my skin.\n",
      "Line77: Ok, this product is perfect. I used anti-aging eye cream before and never really saw a difference. I gave it a try on the belif eye bomb after reading good review. This product is a must! It work perfecly. I saw a difference in a week. I use it every day, twice a day; morning and night. I really see a difference. My skin is definitly smoother under my eyes. Will buy again for sure as now a part of my skincare routine. #skincaresecret #skincareroutine #eyebomb #eyescream\n",
      "Line78: 👁 This is a really great eye cream.   It’s lightweight and absorbs quickly and super hydrates my eye area. I like to pair this with my Eye Contour Booster (Baobab + Sarsaparilla) by Odacite to really smooth lines and refresh.   I’m not a big fan of pot eye cream because I feel like it’s easy to pick up too much product and gets exposed to the air.\n",
      "Line79: I'll be honest I don't put that much effort into incorporating an eye cream in my skincare routine because I have tried so many and none of them have really wowed me.  I received this product complementary to test out and my first impression upon seeing it was \"oh great another regular eye cream\" then I used it for the first night and I was genuinely blown away. I have tried eye creams from Estee Lauder, Clinique and even La Mer and none of them have been able to hydrate my dehydrated under eyes, none!  I kid you not, this is something that I am going to purchase with my own money when I run out of the sample size.  The formula at first seems thick but when you start blending it out under your eye it becomes so creamy and it gives an instant feeling of hydration.  When it comes to the fragrance of my face products I tend to stay away from anything that has strong smells especially in skincare because my skin is super sensitive and strong smells bother my nose but this eye cream has a subtle, almost like essential oils smell which I do like alot because I use essential oils daily to help with allergies. If you don't like the smell of essential oils, don't panic because the smell is sooo subtle and it does go away after you apply the cream.  I am really impressed by this product because I didn't expect to like it as much as I do, and I didn't think it would be as good as it claims to be. My only regret is that I haven't tried it sooner, and I don't usually feel so strongly about most product so thats saying something. I HIGHLY recommend this eye cream!! RUN TO THE STORE DON'T WALK!belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line80: This unscented eye cream doesn’t feel as moisturizing to me as the aqua bomb. It does absorb in really fast, though. Maybe I should double it up for better hydration. I have a sample size from a sub box.\n",
      "Line81: This moisturizer has a very very slight medicine smell but it’s not unpleasant. A little goes a long way also!  My under eye area feels instantly smooth, and supple after applying this ! The container looks small, but there is a lot of product there!!  Worth the money!!  Highly recommend!!\n",
      "Line82: I love this eye bomb! My under eye never been this smooth and moisturized as before. After using this for a couple of weeks, my under eye felt well moisturized and the puffiness is gone. I think it will help with fine lines and dark circles too. It has a mild ginger like scent to me. The packaging was nice. I love how lightweight it is and a little product goes a long way. I will definitely recommend this product.   I received this sample product complimentary for testing purposes. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line83: This product brightened up my under eye, I used it every night for about a week and noticed results within a week. We love to see it😻#belifinhydration #contest #complimentary @belifusa @Influenster\n",
      "Line84: I honestly never thought of using eye cream until I received this product. I figured since don’t have noticeably dry skin around my eyes that it wasn’t something that I needed in my skincare routine. Well, let’s just say that after trying this I am glad that did— you don’t need to have dry skin on your eyes to see the benefits of using a moisturizing eye cream. The texture of this is smooth and easy to apply, and it doesn’t irritate my eyes (I have very sensitive eyes). I put it on at night and in the morning I notice that those little fine lines are reduced and it also seems to give me a better result when I apply my eye makeup. I would definitely recommend this. #skincare #antiaging #eyecream\n",
      "Line85: I’ve tried this product before. I love the consistency of the product it’s very hydrating and feels amazing on the skin. A little bit of product goes a long way. I don’t know if I need to continue using it but I haven’t noticed any dramatic difference in my under eye area. The product simply just feels good but I would need to continue use to determine how effective it really is.\n",
      "Line86: Ever since I’ve had my son my under eyes have decided to fight me😅 I honestly haven’t used eye cream a lot. I’ve only used 3 other samples: air repair eye cream, answer from eye cream, and akar eye serum... but out of those this one was by far my favorite. It was so much more hydrating than the other two. It was lightweight, but way more moisturizing than the others. It wasn’t greasy at all. I do think it helped my dark circles a bit (the others didn’t do a thing except the serum). I think with consistent use this eye cream would be really good. I might even buy more when I run out🤷🏼‍♀️😊  I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  #belifinhydration #contest #complimentary @belifusa @influenster #springintosummervoxbox #skincare #skincaretips #eyecream #eyecreams #makeup #skincareroutine #eyeserum #darkcircles #darkcirclestreatment #skinhealth #healthyskin #rings #diamonds   belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line87: I received this product as a free sample in a Voxbox from Influenster, thank you! The product itself feels nice and smooth. Not really scented and goes on the skin easy. I just didn’t notice any change to my under eyes or eye lids after using this for a couple weeks.\n",
      "Line88: I recently got this product sent to me in a #voxbox a couple of days ago and I love it , a little goes a long way and it helped under my eyes so much !!! The packaging for the #voxbox was so cute !\n",
      "Line89: Well I received a deluxe sample of this eye cream as “free with $35 purchase” from Sephora Canada and I loved it! This simple eye cream does exactly  what it claims. It provides great hydration to the delicate under eyes area and makes it well- hydrated and plumped. No scents, not heavy! Great moisturizer for under eyes are!💙\n",
      "Line90: This eye cream is truly amazing. I didn't think much of trying it out when I received it , but I'm so glad I did. It keeps my under eyes so moisturized and hydrated. It's quick to absorb and sits nicely on my skin. I will definitely be purchasing the full size when I run out of the sample size.\n",
      "Line91: This works so well! I personally never used eye cream before because I didn’t think I needed it but after using this I could see a difference! My under eyes were well hydrated and looked smoother.\n",
      "Line92: A really great eye cream for dry under eyes! I have the mini size and it’s lasted me since January! The literal definition of a little goes a long way! I really love this one and if I didn’t have others I would repurchase it! Not oily at all and hydrates so well!\n",
      "Line93: I don’t have very dry or sensitive under eyes. Most days I skip under eye concealer because it sometimes looks dry + creases. However, whenever I use this eye cream I don’t notice that as much, which is a huge plus! The formula is very lightweight and super moisturizing and wears well under makeup. It has the *slightest* minty/herbal scent but it fades quickly. The product says it is made for sensitive skin so hopefully that wouldn’t irritate anyone. This claims to give 26 hours of moisture and helps boost elasticity of the skin around the eye. The product retails for $48 for 25 mls. When I first got this product and saw the price I did not think I would repurchase. However, i use the tiniest amount I think this would be a good product to invest in since it would last awhile. This product is made without sulfates, phthalates, mineral oil and is vegan. - Overall, I do enjoy this product and I think it is effective. Unfortunately Belif is not considered cruelty free since they sell in China. Because of that, I can’t give this 5 stars. I would definitely repurchase this product if Belif became 100% cruelty free, I would also like to try other products from them. If that is not a priority to you, I do think this is a great product!\n",
      "Line94: Wow I love this moisturizer, my under eyes feels soft and glowing, and the bed hydrated, the texture and formula it’s the best, I used at night and before makeup and wow it works perfectly with my concealer, I can see the difference now✨,  I received these product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. # belifinhydration #contest #complimentary belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb Influenster\n",
      "Line95: This product it is amazing for who is looking less dark circles and promotes more elasticity around the eye. It is easy to use and self explanatory. There is a nice package. I really recommend this product.belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line96: I love this eye cream belif is really starting to win me over with there aqua bomb skincare line. Every product I have tried thus far is amazing. I started using this eye cream a week ago and it is insanely good. It is such a thick and creamy texture a little surely goes a long way. Also it absorbs into the skin wonderfully and leaves my under-eye feeling hydrated and nourished. This eye cream helps my concealer look flawless and certainly has been helping with my slight eye wrinkles. Though not to noticeable without makeup unfortunately when I apply my concealer it tends to sink into those wrinkles making them look more prominent. But this eye cream has surly been helping with that issue. As far as dark circles are concerned unfortunately that is still a big issue and I haven’t seen much change in that category but nonetheless it doesn’t make this eye cream any less awesome. I just have to find something to work along with it to help with that specific issue. Overall I am definitely going to be purchasing this eye cream and I recommend anyone who was thinking about giving it a try to give it a go. It is so freaking good.

      "Line97: I purchased the deluxe size from Ipsy in my August box as a add on. I have a odd dry patch on both eyes that does not play nice. This product appears to be helping. I will be purchasing the full size once I run out. But, the sample size is a generous amount.\n",
      "Line98: I love this moisturizing little eye bomb! The texture is unique compared to other eye creams. It’s got a rich, velvety, silky texture that glides across your eye area and keeps it nice and elastic.

      "Line99: Amazing product. Silky. Not heavy or greasy! Def moisturizing and awesome for that sensitive skin under your eyes. Def reccommend\n",
      "Line100: I love trying out eye moisturizers to see which one works best for me. I received a sample size of this product and this winter I would say it helped moisturize and it saved my under eye. I love the feel of the product and putting it on it hydrates well and works. This is a great eye moisturizer I would recommend.belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line101: Recently started using this product and I absolutely love it. It is so gentle and moisturizing. It really hydrates for hours. I also like that it is perfect packaging for travel since it's not glass. Definitely a new staple in my beauty routine! Compliments of Influenster.\n",
      "Line102: I love this product! It's hydrating and refreshing without being sticky or weighty around the eye. I used it mostly overnight and I woke up looking refreshed, especially around my undereyes.   Another staple in my skincare routine. Good for all year use too!\n",
      "Line103: I had a deluxe sample size of this eye cream from a Belif gift set and am almost finished with the jar... Overall, I really liked this Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. I would describe it as a lightweight refreshing eye cream, not quite a water gel since the consistency is much thicker, but very refreshing. It has a cooling texture that instantly bursts with hydration and blends seamlessly, keeping the eye area supple and hydrated while prepping it for a smooth crease-free makeup application. I had no issues with this eye cream causing milia or pilling up on my skin. The key ingredients in this product are tiger grass which soothes skin, and comfrey leaf, which is a deeply moisturizing herb that Scottish farmers used historically to hydrate their calloused hands. In my experience, this eye cream is probably best for those with dry skin, but it’s still a good overall eye cream for all skin types.   As with all belif products, this Eye Bomb is dermatologically tested and free of mineral oils, petrolatum, and synthetic dyes, fragrances, and animal origin ingredients. It’s also formulated without parabens, sulfates, and phthalates.\n",
      "Line104: Smells amazing! I love the texture — some eye creams are too thick or very watery. This is the perfect consistency.\n",
      "Line105: I'm using just a little at a time and that's enough. I have the lower part of my eyes dark and with this product I feel that part more hydrated. I received a sample from Influenster and I am loving it. The eye part is one of the most important parts of the face and we need to take care of it, and this product is helping me.\n",
      "Line106: Actually, it’s not a wow effect! But I have never try wow effect eye cream! So, I love this cooling texture and how it hydrated my skin! It's clean cosmetics product! No SLS, mineral oils, synthetic preservatives! It's very, very important for me! And I really happy to try belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb almost one week!  @BELIFUSA #BELIFINHYDRATION #complimentary #fairyofmakeup #olasher #olashermua #eyecream #eyebomb\n",
      "Line107: This product is a must have. The belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb leaves your under eyes feeling so refreshed and hydrated without giving them a heavy feeling. This product also has a nice light smell to it which is great. I highly recommend purchasing this eye bomb, it is worth the buy! I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\n",
      "Line108: I received this complimentary product in my voxbox. I never thought I needed eye cream before I tried this! I never realized my under eyes were so dry and I put this eye moisturizing on and it changed completely. My under eyes looks so shiny and fresh. I totally recommend this product, it does wonders and you need to use very little to do both eyes so it is very economical. I love it!! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",

      "Line110: OMG! This is the best eye cream I've ever tried. It's so lightweight, it feels so good after being applied and it definitely moisturizes the skin around the eyes. I'd definitely keep on using it and I'd also recommend it to others. It couldn't be better.\n",
      "Line111: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb It is very small in size but very eclectic, moisturizes the skin around the eyes well, makes it soft, the structure is also very gentle, I liked it,i reccomend 👌👌👌👌\n",
      "Line112: I want to express my love for this product, I bought 2 another after using the first one. I love the smell and texture of it 😋💖💖💖 Big Big recommendations from me🥰\n",
      "Line113: I got this as a sample as you can see in the photo. I have been using this sample for almost and month, morning/night, and my dark circles are so much less noticeable. Under my eyes feel not too puffy and very moisturized. The reason I gave this products 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. I would repurchase this if it wasn’t $48 on Sephora :/\n",
      "Line114: I am very happy with this cream.  I admit that I often forget to use it.   I use it twice a week and I immediately notice the result.\n",
      "Line115: I was not impressed by this product at all, it only took three days for my skin to start hating it. It caused the skin under my eyes to break out in tons of tiny little bumps (I’m suspecting it was the fragrance). However, one thing that I did like about this product is the texture, it’s very creamy and it felt great upon application.\n",
      "Line116: Truly a bomb of moisture! I love dabbing a bit of this on my eyes, and immediately I can feel a difference on my under eye. I like how I only need to apply a little bit so I can't imagine how long this will last me 😆 gotta love how it's also fragence free because I would not like anything fragence near my eyea, no thank youuuu!\n",
      "Line117: A little bit of this product goes a long way! It absorbs well and is super hydrating!\n",
      "Line118: I have been loving this eye cream that came in my #voxbox ! It has already improved the look around my eyes where my fine lines were starting to look bigger and bolder than usual.   I love that it provides intense moisture without being greasy and the light scent is nice.\n",
      "Line119: It’s really good! My skin feels smooth, hydrated and fresh after using this cream a few days and it helps me with my dark circles!\n",
      "Line120: I get little dry patches on the skin around my eyes, but after a few days of using this I haven’t noticed them anymore! Also has a nice very subtle scent\n",
      "Line121: Belif is really all around one of my favorite brands. Their eye cream just feels like you are putting a cloud under your eyes. I’ve purchased this eye cream over and over again, never irritates, always silky & smooth as could be. There is not one bad thing to say about it, simply heavenly.\n",
      "Line122: I love this eye cream its so silly smooth and hydrating under the eyes every time I use it my under eyes feel so refreshed! I got a mini size of this months back in a subscription box and still have some left because a little goes a long way with this stuff. I will be buying the full size when I run out.highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Line123: I just started using this eye bomb 💣 and I love it! It is super moisturizing and you only need a little bit. I like it because it wakes my eyes up but it’s not harsh or overpowering. I first received this in my Ipsy bag and now I’m hooked.\n",
      "Line124: I like this eye cream, it keeps my skin hydrated all day long. It doesn’t help with fine lines, but at least my skin is moisturized!\n",
      "Line125: * Sent complimentary thru influencer * I do really like this eye cream. feels very lightweight but hydrating And calming . It does have fragrance that is nice but I prefer without any for my skincare needs.\n",
      "Line126: I tried this under one eye for comparison, and I do notice a difference! It does feel more moisturized. I’m just confused about the long ingredient list, and why willow bark (isn’t this a BHA)? In an eye cream? However, It does have moisturizing factors ( ceramide np, squalane, and glycerin for example), which makes sense. Other wise I like it! #belifinhydration #contest #complimentary @belifusa @influenster\n",
      "Line127: It is a very good brand but not the best, the cost is much for what it is actually worth in my opinion, not everything is bad, but honestly it could be better.\n",
      "Line128: I was so lucky to get the product in the voxbox!! I tried it and it's AMZING!  definitely will be purchasing this product! amazing!!\n",
      "Line129: I’m an avid user of eye cream and I’ve tried a few brands. By far, this one is one of my favorites. I just feel like it works so well under my eyes. My under eyes feel rejuvenated after applying this and feels very hydrated. It’s a thicker cream but I feel like it’s not as thick as the etude house eye cream—if you’ve ever tried that one!\n",
      "Line130: Before I started using the eye bomb I always switched around my eye creams. I even tried using products from drunk elephant which left my skin feeling super oily plus they were very expensive! The eye bomb is not cheap but worth paying for the product itself. I have noticed that my lines have gone away and my skin is much smoother. I would buy again!\n",
      "Line131: Oh, my word!  This stuff is amazing!  Thus stuff leaves the skin under and around my eyes really soft and hydrated.  I only have a sample size that I got from IPSY,  but I think when I run out, I'm  going to have to buy a full size.  This stuff is super gentle on skin, especially sensitive skin, like mine.  I recommend this product.\n",
      "Line132: This is a good eye cream for the price at night I like to apply a generous amount, during the day since I do like to wear make up I use a light amount so my make up can be applied good if you over apply the eye cream and try to put your make up it will be a mess atleast that’s my experience,\n",
      "Line133: Nice product. I use it all the time, during the day, under my makeup and at night time. Haven’t really seen drastic changes in the color of my under eye area. But it sure feels more hydrated. Got a trial size as a sample from Sephora. Thinking of getting the full product now. Please share your experience with it:)\n",
      "Line134: So I got the Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb moisturizer sample from my Influenster #SpringintoSummerVoxBox and I have to say this stuff is amazing. I’m not one to put a different moisturizer under my eyes but I tried this and I can’t stop using it. It’s super light weight, under my eyes is so much more elastic and it works great with makeup! Ngl I definitely want to try their other products because of how smooth and soft it leaves my skin.\n",
      "Line135: SO MOISTURIZING. I can actually FEEL how long it lasts. Even after applying makeup. I would definitely purchase belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line136: I suffer from dry under eyes that causes my concealer to crease under my eyes and after applying this before my makeup I no longer have issues with that! This has a gel/cream texture. It’s not heavy on your skin. It also has no fragrance and dint irritate my skin. Will definitely be looking into buying the full size! I received this #complimentary in my #springintosummer #voxbox.\n",
      "Line137: Although I got this in my #springintosummervoxbox this is not my first time trying! Strong stuff that makes a difference and de puffs. Do not put anywhere else other than eye area. I learned the hard way. 🤦🏼‍♀️ this little tester will last a long time! Good price point. Overall, I like this brand a lot. MUST TRY- aqua bomb! Xo\n",
      "Line138: In my earlier 20’s I didn’t think that skin care, let alone under eye care, was important. Let me tell you. Those crows feet and bags showed up QUICK after having my son. I started getting into eye creams and realized that they are important and do help ward off fine lines and wrinkles! This eye cream is a mix of a cream and a gel and makes me eyes feel tight and bright. It’s so soft on my skin and light weight!\n",
      "Line139: PROS - nice, gel-like consistency - smell - refreshing, cool feeling when applied  CONS - price - not effective? i did not see any effects. this was recommended to me by the lady that helped me at sephora, said this was their best-seller so i gave it a try. - packaging\n",
      "Line140: I recieved this in one of boxes, I like it’s scent, and it’s cery pleasent when applyed and you need little bit amount to moisturize you under eye area. but the important thing is than I don’s see any difference between before/after. maybe it’s because of tiny package\n",
      "Line141: Got this with my points from Sephora - haven’t used it long enough to see results but like the texture and how smooth it goes on. Will update my review after prolonged use and let you know the results\n",
      "Line142: HELLO EVERYONE! So if anyone wants me to do a HONEST review on a product, or you have some question make sure to COMMENT anything you want. And if you want to see more reviews make sure to FOLLOW me. Have a great day! 😊⭐️ this is the product of the day:\n",
      "Line143: Ok this is perfect for someone who has dry under eyes but it doesn’t do much in my opinion. It’s hydrating but don’t lift the eye or have anti-aging properties. Definitely would recommend to someone with dry under eyes! Tried this product thanks to #springintosummervoxbox￼\n",
      "Line144: I use this product just few days and it's moisturizing my eyes very well! It has a light feeling but it works pretty good. I would recommend this product to everyone. ❤️\n",
      "Line145: I received this eye cream as complimentary for testing purposes. This eye cream smells amazing. It light weight and glides on evenly. It’s feels like a water based cream than a lotion cream. After applying the eye cream under my  eyes it feels like it help with a little firming by keeping my under eyes hydrated.  Although I did expect it to do a little more but at least it kept it a little hydrated. I used this product before I apply my makeup so it did not crease my concealer. It actually made my makeup look a little smoother which I like. If you want something light weight I  recommend this product. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line146: I got this eye bomb cream from influenster and I loved it. It hydrates your eyes without making it feel greasy and it has a beautiful citrus smell. I know you can get it at sephora but it is a little pricey. It will last you a long time though so I think it's worth the price\n",
      "Line147: I loved the texture of this cream. It had no scent with is always great. I ove been putting it on at night and I already see a difference. My dark circles are less visible and that area not as thin. I liked the thickness of this cream.\n",
      "Line148: It’s the best moisturizer I have ever used, it’s nice feeling when you put it on under eye, it makes you feel fresh and hydrating.\n",
      "Line149: Literally an eye bomb ❤️❤️❤️ I love love love this cream. It’s a jelly consistency and you’re eyes feel immediately hydrated. I use products from other brands but I can always tell a difference when I use this eye cream.\n",
      "Line150: This eye cream is a BOMB haha, literally! I used to have some problems with my under eye, they was very dark, but in the pictures you can see, they are lighter and I love it. I wear this cream every night and is a miracle in a bottle🦋belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb #eyecream #undereye #aquabomb #belif #darkcircles #moisturize #skincare\n",
      "Line151: I’m a true belif-er after using this moisturizing eye bomb. This cream is very hydrating and provides a lot of moisture. It is also not sticky and you get a cooling sensation when you apply it under your eyes. A little dab goes a long way!\n",
      "Line152: This is super hydrating for me eyes! Definitely leaves my under eyes moisturized and it’s not too sticky nor greasy. I have the trial size so I’ve been trying it out for a couple weeks now and I’m hoping it lightens up my dark circles!\n",
      "Line153: I haven’t really noticed a difference using this eye cream and I definitely think there are better ones out there. I still give it 3 stars because it hydrates around my eyes and also lessens the dark circles slightly. I wouldn’t purchase it again unless I had no other options.\n",
      "Line154: OMG I GOT THIS FROM@Influenster AS COMPLIMENTARY SUMMER VOXBOX 2 WEEKS AGO AND I STARTED USING IT AND MY EYES NEVER FELT THIS HYDRATED SOFT AND RELAXING IM LITERALLY IN LOVEEE belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line155: It's super hydrating and after using it once I can tell that my darkness under my eyes has gone down. My only con is that it's more of a gel consistency and I prefer a cream because it makes me feel more hydrated.\n",
      "Line156: This is one of best moisturisers I have ever tried. This is super hydrating and concentrated. I use this morning and night and anytime in between that the skin around my eyes are dry. It leaves my skin looking some smoother and younger. No line fines any more. And I notice the reduction of the dark circles under my eyes. Great product\n",
      "Line157: I received a small sample of this in my Sephora play box and I absolutely loved it. It is extremely hydrating and not greasy at all. I like wearing it both at night and under my make up. ￼\n",
      "Line158: Nice eye moisturizer 🧴 has no smell works wonder i don’t mind this product at all real nice\n",
      "Line159: The super cold weather just began in the Mid-Atlantic, so this eye cream complimentary of Influenster came at the perfect time. It has the best velvety texture and really provides all-day moisture. I have pretty bad under eye bags that are accentuated by dry skin, so this has been really great. The size of the package is really generous as well.\n",
      "Line160: This helps with the puffiness of my eyes I really like this product and will definitely purchase a bigger size.\n",
      "Line161: I got this sample on Ipsy, I didn't care about it until I saw some reviews, so I started using it, I could notice that the skin was hydrated with a smooth appearance, I liked the effect, the skin absorbs it very well. As it is a small sample, I use it as an eye moisturizer when I do a special makeup.\n",
      "Line162: Under eye lines are finally gone! This moisturizing eye cream helps to smooth fine lines and boosts skin elasticity! I applied nightly and saw results in just a month! My under eyes look youthful and fresh, no more creasing or terrible lines. I highly recommend this product for all types of skin! The hydrating herbs are gentle on sensitive skin like mine! If you love radiant under eyes add this to your skincare routine!\n",
      "Line163: I received this product complimentary from Influenster. I think it is a good eye cream, it’s very moisturizing. I just wish it didn’t have any fragrance or essential oils because they can be irritating, especially under the eyes. I will use the sample I got but I wouldn’t buy it myself. It is also very expensive for an eye cream.\n",
      "Line164: I loved this! It was hydrating all day and it honestly improved my bags for me I feel like they’ve gotten lighter. It’s even better underneath makeup! I definitely recommend this! With or without makeup.\n",
      "Line165: This product feels great on the skin. I haven’t noticed a huge difference but it definitely feels cooling under the eyes. It also seems to brighten my skin a bit. Love the packaging of the product as well.\n",
      "Line166: This eye bomb has definitely helped with my under eye bags , dark circles and dry skin on my eye lids. I love the additional cap inside to jar to seal the jar extra tight to keep it at is right consistency and fresh! Definitely worth the money!\n",

      "Line170: 💙💎💙I got a little sample with my online purchase and I'm saving money to buy a full size and eventually more items in the line.💙💎💙 It hydrates under my eyes perfectly and makes my bags less noticeable. Feels very fresh. Smells like herbs. This product truly makes me feel comfortable in my skin and I'm ugly so it's a big deal.💙💎💙\n",
      "Line171: Another one of those five star products that people were absolutely raving about so I had to try it... So disappointing!! After a few days I started getting tiny white bumps under both eyes!! Instantly stopped using this, Honestly don't know why I still have it around. I've only had a couple products do this to me and it sucks 😭 I really wanted a miracle!!\n",
      "Line172: One of the best eye creams I have ever tried in the sense that makes under eye very soft and fresh and helps to feed nutrition to my dark circles. I really love it for day to day wear and would definitely repurchase! #bestof2019\n",
      "Line173: This is my favorite under eye cream ever!! Very impressed with how well it really works & makes my eyes look so youthful!! Creamy & smooth gel like formula really does what it's intended to do it helps me with puffiness & gives my under eyes that added glow!!

      "Line177: I prefer the ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% Egcg than this. I got this sample from my spring to summer voxbox and I don’t really like it. The purfume is too strong and it’s just irritate my under eyes area.\n",
      "Line178: I have used other eye creams but with this one I really felt a difference in about two weeks! The skin in my eyes is softer and you can use it under make up. If you are looking for a good hydration for the eye area, look no further!\n",
      "Line179: I started using it yesterday, it came with my VoxBox, I did not feel much the change form one day to the next, but what I did feel and saw, was that normally I wake up with many dark circles and today when I woke up I noticed that they were not very noticeable and I think that if I follow it using will disappear completely, if you suffer from many dark circles like me, I recommend it!belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",

It is really expensive and that’s the only problem I would have for repurchasing it but it’s a great one!! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line182: When i buy somethin for my eyes i am so nervous about how it works. Because skin aroun eyes is so delicate. I love this product. I trust it. It does not causes irritation. Great value for me. For sure, recommended.\n",
      "Line183: I love this brand. I love the consistency of the eye cream. I had no complaints. However I recently started noticing it’s not absorbing into my skin. If I run my eye the next morning I can feel the product ball up. Disappointing!\n",
      "Line184: Haven’t noticed a difference in my eyes but I like the cream. A little goes a long wayyyy. I always get the deluxe staples from kits and Sephora. It does have a great feel after being applied and sometimes it runs into my eye that burns like a bitch. But in the products defense it says avoid direct contact with the eyes\n",
      "Line185: I really like this product and I love it smells. I feel like I'm always looking for something to help hydrate the eye area, under eye and in between the eyes and also always looking for something to kind of help with brightening and smoothing as well.❤️❤️\n",
      "Line186: I absolutely love this stuff! It brings an instant glow and luminous look to the face. After I go to bed and wake up in the morning there is absolutely no lines underneath my eyes.

      "Line189: I loved this eye cream. It’s a great thick texture that makes in feel like the product is actually being absorbed into the skin and is helping benefit the delicate skin around my eyes. I definitely thought it was moisturizing and it’s got a good price point for what it does.\n",
      "Line190: I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I have been using this product for several days and I have noticeably seen a difference in my skin.

      "Line192: This moisturizer is very lightweight. My skin is dry and this moisturizer kept my under eyes very normal. The application was smooth and very gentle on the skin. The smell of the product was not harsh, it has a pleasant smell to the moisturizer. #SpringIntoSummerVoxBox #Complimentary #BelifInHydration belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line193: This eye cream is nourishing and so comforting on my eyes. My skin is so sensitive but this cream went above and beyond and soothed my eyes and is LONG LASTING! I would definitely buy this again it's silky and also smells amazing!\n",
      "Line194: This is by far my favorite eye cream! I received a sample of it in a Sephora order and I have been hooked ever since. This reduced puffiness and dark circles immediately. My fine lines seem to be less pronounced as well. Love it.\n",
      "Line195: I absolutely love this. It makes my skin so hydrate under my eyes and also calls it when I apply this. It is like an eye cream I have never tried and I would re-purchase this over and over and over and over again that it is expensive for an eye cream and how much it covers with but it is truly amazing.\n",

      "Line197: I’ve been using this product for about a month and a half now- it’s been doing its job and keeps my eyes moisturized although I feel that I have to use a lot of the product to do so. It’s very thin and almost has a gel-like feel to it. I have oily eyelids and it helps with that because my lids just absorb the product well. Applying eyeliner and mascara after this eye cream is also easy to do! I recommend for the price\n",
      "Line198: Recibí esta cremita en mi allure box y es disperso hidratante sientes una frescura al aplicarla en el contorno de tus ojos, el empaque no es que me haya agradado mucho ya que siento que no es la manera más efectiva de sacar el producto pero funciona súper bien te hidrata un buen la piel… belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",

The texture is thick but not heavy and leaves my face feeling so soft and moisturized, my face loves this product !! It doesn't get enough hype,  please give this a try!!!  belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb\n",
      "Line200: I love this duo! I use the eye cream and the face cream nightly. The eye cream is so hydrating and a silky smooth feeling. A little goes a long way. I suggest only using it at night though, as it is not a good base for makeup. It needs a few hours to really saturate in your skin, so may cause pilling if applying in the mornings. I also love the face cream for night as well because it is a heavier moisturizer and really hydrates my combo skin. I always wake up with dewy and refreshed skin. Will be repurchasing this combo for sure. These 2 are set to stay in my nighttime routine.\n",
      "Line201: I really like using this kept my eyes moisturized all day.works really good in cold weather.\n",
      "Line202: I really like belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. It goes on smooth and I feel like it keeps the moisture good under my eyes. No complaints here. I like it so much I bought another one.  That's saying a lot because usually I like to try lots of different products.\n",
      "Line203: This moisturizing eye bomb has become my new favorite daytime addition to my skincare routine. It’s the last thing I apply before the start of my day. I LOVE how lightweight it feels, how quickly it absorbs, and its refreshing, clean fragrance. I’ve been raving about it so much, that I’ve even gotten my boyfriend to fall for the trend. I feel like this product really eliminates my dark circles and makes my eyes look more refreshed and hydrated. He agrees. I made the mistake of applying too much the first time I used it.. so a little definitely goes a long way.. which is great given it’s price tag. I gently tap it around and under my eyes and give it a few minutes to absorb. It’s usually the last thing I apply during my morning skincare routine. I’d say it’s great for either daytime or nighttime use. It contains pennywort herb, also known as gotu kola, which improves circulation, giving you that elastic and smooth look. Comfrey leaf leaves your skin feeling moisturized and glowing. If it weren’t for the price, I’d be buying this product more frequently. I’d highly recommend this product if you’re looking for a quick and effective eye cream to start off each of your mornings!

      "Line206: Got this in a decent sample size from Ipsy and just finished the container. It goes on as a medium lotion--not thick or light. Overall, I didn't notice any difference, but I love the herbs they mention as their ingredients. However, I don't see myself purchasing this product. It's not listed as \"clean,\" and it's a bit pricey. For that price, I can get a clean, organic product. Because I didn't really see a difference, my search for an organic eye cream continues. I guess I should mention my only eye concern is wrinkles. I'm not puffy or dark in that area.\n",

      "Line212: I am SCREAMING over this product! I got a sample of it then 5 days later bought it from Ulta. Kinda pricey ($50) BUT it last forever so it’s worth every penny!

      "Line224: I have been using this for a couple of weeks. I really enjoy how moisturizing it is. Easily absorbs into the skin and the product lasts a long time. The only thing I dislike about it is I wish it came with some scoop so I wouldn't have to put my fingers in the jar.\n",
      "Line225: This is such a great eye cream! After about a week of usage, I felt it really helped with the bags under my eyes. The product is very thick, but very easy to apply. You can feel how well the moisturizer penetrates when you first apply. Super cute packaging, would recommend!\n",
      "Line226: I absolutely love this product. It provides so much moisture. I like using serums underneath it. It also lasts for so long, the coverage is pretty amazing.

Since the dryness emphasizes fine lines.  I was super excited to try the Belif Moisturizing eye bomb and I put it to the test by applying it at night time along with my skin care routine and my first impression was that it has a nice consistency creamy but not oily or sticky like other creams I’ve tried, another thing I love is that I could feel immediately how my skin absorb it and it made my skin feel and look hydrated and smooth, its like if I was applying a protective coat to my skin, a little goes a long way. It helps tighten the skin and definitely soften the fine lines under my eyes, its lightweight and it does have a long lasting effect.  This is definitely the best moisturizing eye bomb I’ve tried and my new Obsession, I would definitely recommend it! its magic in a jar!\n",

      "Line247: This is a nice eye cream. I have super dry under eyes and I need something more moisturizing for my eyes. I mainly use this on mornings under my makeup. The makeup goes over this cream really nicely. If you have normal or oily skin you will love this.\n",

      "Line249: I actually keep a few small jars of this in my fridge. The cold gel feels great under my heavy eyes first thing in the morning or even after a long work day.

      "Line253: I absolutely love this eye bomb! It firms my puffy eyes and give me an eye lift. I wouldn’t improve this at all. I love that it’s plant based. It’s very effective although it is a little pricey, but worth every penny! I will be buying it again as Avon sells it now.\n",
      "Line254: I was so excited to try this because i LOVE eye creams. I absolutely love the texture and that so little goes so far. My only complaint is that it leaves my eyes feeling a little greasy. Either way I'll love using it up. It definitely has its value, you really only need a tiny dab on your finger to cover your entire eye, both under and top.\n",
      "Line255: I got a sample of this through the mail to try.    I'd gotten the information from a website I use a lot and sent off for some samples from them. They didn't disappoint!!

      "Line260: Smells very nice, has a fantastic texture, absorbs well, etc. The big issue is that it is so heavily perfumed that I just had a horrible allergic reaction to it where one of my eyes swelled most of the way shut. I was fine when on my hand for applying, but the sensitive skin around my eyes has been in horrible pain and inflamed. I've never had issues with scented products before, but with this being so pungent and going on a very sensitive area, it was a disaster for me. 3/5 because otherwise it would be fine, but the perfume in this product runs a very serious risk for reaction and possible infection. I don't even have sensitive eyes, so those who do, possibly be warned?\n",
      "Line261: I received this from Influenster and Belif for testing purposes. Hands down - IN LOVE WITH THIS! This eye bomb worked like a charm! I use this every morning and night, and I have seen a huge difference. I definitely recommend this product to anyone!\n",
      "Line262: The belief Moisturizing Eye Bomb is probably the best product I have ever had the chance to try on Influenster. I used it every day in the morning and at night and it left the area around my eyes hydrated and refreshed. There was a visible difference in reducing bags and dark circles!\n",

      "Line264: I am still using the Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb and haven't noticed much a difference yet. I put it on every night before I go to sleep and I definitely feel the moisture but not sure if I feel as though my skin has tightened around my eyes. I like the way it feels when applied to my skin and how breathable I feel. Jury is still out if I think it's actually improving the tension of my skin\n",

      "Line270: I’m unconvinced that eye creams are actually necessary. With that said, I have a couple of small jars of these that I’ve gotten with Sephora points and I do use them sometimes. It feels nice and soothing when I put it on. I don’t think it really does anything for dark circles or fine lines, etc, though.\n",
      "Line271: This eye cream is really hydrating!, I use it overnight and next day my under eye area looked good but I feel it does not reduce the coloration or the bags, is good just for hydration.\n",

      "Line273: Belief eye bomb moisturizing cream is absolutely amazing. The smallest amount goes a long way. It works by moisturizing dry, puffy under eye area and by doing this diminishes under eye darkness. It has an amazing texture making sure to not leave the skin greasy; as well as an incredible delicate scent. Please give a round of applause to this great indy product!! Definitely a must by hot item.\n",
      "Line274: I really like this eye cream. I’ve been using it every night for about 6 months now. I had been using the kiehls avocado eye cream and it’ is nice.  I got a few samples of this that came in sets with Belif moisturizer. I decided to start using them, and was surprised to find out that I actually like this better. I didn’t think that I would because it does have a lighter texture and I really need a very moisturizing product. I was happy to find out that even though the texture is lighter, it’s actually more moisturizing. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",

      "Line276: Run of the mill. It's a bit too fragranced and a bit too watery for me to truly believe in it is a moisture bomb. I wish it had more vitamins and a creamier consistency.\n",
      "Line277: After someone answered my question regarding this product, I found out about the 100 point sample available at Sephora. Got the item and have been trying it for a week now. As of now, it is hard to say whether it does what it advertises. However, it is very nourishing and absorbs into the skin quite well.\n",

This cooling texture instantly bursts with hydration and blends seamlessly, keeping the eye area supple and hydrated while prepping it for a smooth crease-free makeup application.   I got this in small size form the belif set I bought from Sephora and I have been loving this since. I have sensitive eyes and there have been creams I love the result of, but they make my eyes burn or cause milia bumps. This cream is light, but still very hydrating. It absorbs quickly which is great especially for wearing makeup. I noticed a difference in the hydration of my under eyes within 3-4 days of using morning and night.\n",
      "Line279: Currently trying a sample received in a beauty subscription.    Not sure what to expect from a \"clean\" product.  So far, no adverse skin reactions.

This one and the farmacy are definitely my top two.\n",
      "Line282: This is a fantastic product.  I love the light weight, cooling gel.  It is wonderful for hydrating the under eye.  If you have dry under eyes, this is for you.  It is very gentle, no irritation at all.  I recommend you give it a try.\n",

      "Line286: OMG I absolutely love this product. I use it every night after cleansing with my derma e cleansing oil and after I spray my Mario rose spray. This works for me as I have allergies and sensitive skin. If you need an extra boost of moisture under your eyes this is the product for you. I'm in my 40s and people always say I look like I'm in my 30s. I think it's due to good skincare and keeping your eyes hydrated. I recommend this product.\n",
      "Line287: Thought his eye cream would be great for my dry and sensitive skin but it made my skin sting a little after putting on, which I don’t mind too much. Within a week the skin around my eyes was super dry, itchy and scary looking, I stopped using it and went back to my regular eye cream and my skin went back to normal. I gave it one more try and the dryness came back!! Unfortunately, this product just didn’t work for me. A big NO!\n",
      "Line288: Fantastic eye cream! Truly feel hydrated all day. Great prep before concealer.  Never look dry. Sometimes I mix a little with concealer for a more natural look.\n",
      "Line289: I got a sample of this in Ipsy and was excited to try it after hearing people rave about it for years, but I don’t understand the hype. This is basically just a moisturizer you can use in the eye area. It doesn’t depuff, brighten, or plump the eye area at all. It simply hydrates and is a nice base for under eye concealer, but using my moisturizer in my eye area does the exact same thing. This uses a lot of silicones so it will reduce the appearance of fine lines/creasing until you wash it off, but it isn’t treating or reducing them at all and isn’t anti-aging. I can’t knock this product too much because it doesn’t really claim to do any of these things, I just can’t understand why so many people would spend $50 on a product when most moisturizers can do the same thing. I will give it a little credit though for being gentle on my sensitive eyes.\n",
      "Line290: I was so lucky to receive this product in my Belif Voxbox from Influenster. I absolutely love their True Cream Aqua Bomb. It has become my number one moisturizer and nothing else can compare to it.  The formula of this Moisture Bomb eye cream is so soothing and cooling on the eyes. It absorbs instantly and leaves the skin around my eyes super hydrated. I actually never realized that I had a couple dry patches on my eyelids, making it difficult to blend out shadows in certain areas. This product has completely eliminated that dry flaky skin on my lids. I am so happy I was able to try this product and will definitely be repurchasing. I get a lot of eye creams to try and often do not end up repurchasing because they all seem to do the same thing. Not true with this product.\n",
      "Line291: I received this product to test out through Influenster and I am HOOKED! I seriously have never felt such a luxurious, hydrating cream. I wish I could cover my whole body in this stuff! I will certainly be buying this in the future as it has become a staple in my beauty routine!\n",
      "Line292: I would say this eye cream is definitely moisturizing not exactly sure 26 hrs worth. It is the right consistency and easy to apply. It does moisturize under the eye but didn’t notice a difference with fine lines/ wrinkles or dark circles. Also, it is fragranced with a floral scent which I wasn’t too fond of.\n",
      "Line293: I’ve only had a chance to try a mini (5ml); but I was quickly sold! I loved the lightweight texture, it’s very refreshing. I also don’t mind the packaging but prefer a pump. Even so, I’d consider repurchasing this once I’ve finished what I’m currently using.\n",
      "Line294: The price is pretty good, the product is pretty good and it last a very long time. I think this kind of eye cream is better in the summer when the skin doesn’t need as much moisturizing. I have dry patches on my lid right now and this eye cream has done nothing to help. I would use it as a lighter moisturizer for the warmer months when my skin is more oily and prefers a gel cream.\n",

      "Line299: This is one of those products that I WISH I didn’t love because it’s pricey. I think it’s roughly $60 CAD, which is a lot for an eye cream, especially one that doesn’t have retinol. That being said, this eye cream has been a god send this cold Alberta winter. It is so thick and hydrating, and has great soothing and detoxifying ingredients. I have had zero issues with dryness around my eyes, and I even use a little around my nostrils to keep the dry patches away. If you’re a fan of the aqua bomb, be aware that this is not the same consistency or texture, it is a much thicker cream. I haven’t noticed any crazy bags around my eyes while using this, and I think it’s because the area is so plump and hydrated.\n",
      "Line300: It's nice and moisturizing, but kind of expensive for what it is. Drugstore eye creams do just as well, in my opinion, although I did like that it is a thick gel rather than a cream. It irritates my eyes a little bit, and felt kind of \"goopy\" (but most eye moisturizers do, anyway). I didn't see much improvement in dark under-eyes or fine lines, not really any brightening, although I can't remember if it made any of those claims antway. It does moisturize nicely. I used it up, but I won't buy more of it.\n",

The Eye Bomb has a light texture which makes it great for pretty much any skin type (including sensitive). The scent is pleasant but light, which is typical for Belif products. This eye cream is primarily for hydration but if your skin is really dry then the belif Peat Miracle Revital Eye Cream may be a better option for you.\n",

I tend to get fine wrinkles under my eyes if my skin gets dry... nothing else moisturizes my under eyes as well! It feels so light and smooth, and works. I was devastated when they were out of stock, as soon as I got word they were back I immediately purchased more!\n",
      "Line314: Great brand. I’ve used this line for a couple years, especially the face moisturizer. A little expensive but all the good brands are. It did help with the dry skin I get under my eyes sometimes, and helped my eyes look less tired and helped with some of my dark circles. I honestly just stopped using it because I change products every once an awhile, and found a product that I like just a tiny bit more. But I do recommend.\n",

      "Line316: This eye bomb is crazy good! I’m not easily impressed with skincare because I’ve tried a lot of products but this one I like a lot. This is a sample from Sephora that I tried recently. It’s great that they give you a decent sample because you can really see if it works. This is a very whipped but dense cream. It has substance. It smells very citrusy to me (think lemons and oranges). I don’t mind the scent but if you’re sensitive to fragrance, this might bother you. You only need a tiny dab of this for each eye. A little goes a long way! It’s very moisturizing and makes the skin around your eyes feel more supple. #skincaresecret #belif #eyecream #fashionista #mymakeupbag #beautyoverhaul #gamechanger\n",

I do use  this with another eye serum but there has been days when I use this alone before I do my makeup & I have noticed  it makes the concealer look smooth. I do love this product a lot & will be repurchasing once I run out. I will recommend this to others.\n",
      "Line319: Got a sample of this in the mail. This eye product is way more thicker & cream-like than the moisturizer & cleanser Belif makes. I never used an eye cream that is this thick before. It was ok. It has the same scent as the cleanser & face cream but alot lighter almost to the point you can't smell that it even has a scent. When I finally run out of all my other skin cleansers & creams I may get this skincare collection.\n",

      "Line325: Ugh I wanted to love this because it was so highly recommended at Sephora. However, it’s more of a gel like consistency and I prefer a heavy creamy consistency more. I believe it was about $40 for the pot. I’ve never had any issues with it, but I also haven’t seen any differences that it’s made. A little disappointed!\n",
      "Line326: I wish i could rate this 100! This is one of my holy grails! I use it everyday! I really really love this along with my face moisturizers from Belif, they make my skin feel so so so soft and good after wearing makeup all day\n",

      "Line328: I love this one! I got this in my ipsy bag and even though it was a small sample it lasts long! The eye cream is very smooth, watery and refreshing.

      "Line330: So I am a ride or die supporter of the brand \"Belif\". With my oily, acne prone, problematic, sensitive skin, their aqua bomb moisturizer is my absolute holy Grail, and I refuse to use anything else. Any product I've ever tried by this brand, I absolutely love. This moisturizing eye bomb doesn't dissapoint neither. I use my aqua bomb moisturizer, followed along with this guy right here, the moisturizing eye bomb. I recently got the aqua bomb sleeping mask, so I'm in pretty good shape at the moment lol. To be honest, Me having the full size of this eye bomb, and have honestly been using for about 2 months now, I can say my honest opinion on this, and that is.. This is one of the best eye creams I have ever owned and used on my oily, acne prone face. Some say this eye bomb does nothing for fine lines, but I beg to differ. I'm 28, been a smoker for over half my life, and try to take extremely good care of my skin (even though I know smoking is terrible) and I plan to quit one day, but until then, I will continue to use \"preventive\" skin care for my aging face, so I can age gracefully. Now, I wouldn't say I have extreme fine lines or anything (like I said, I take good care of my face, expecially being a smoker) but I do have little baby fine lines under my eyes, and this eye bomb DOES plump them up, and helps diminish the appearance of them. I can apply my eye bomb to one eye, and not the other, and you can truly tell a difference. This is not just a hydrating eye cream. This eye cream DOES help with fine lines, and DOES help with brightening up the under eye, and making makeup application a cinch. People don't give this bad boy enough credit if you ask me. I love this product. Since I own the full size, I will vouge and say that this product is worth the price, due to how long it has lasted me. All you need is a dab under each eye, which means this will last a very good while. People keep saying this jar is small, and I also beg to differ on that too. Most eye creams are alot smaller than what the full size eye bomb comes in. Belif has wonderful products, and I will continue to love, use, and support this brand. Don't let these negative reviews change your mind..This eye bomb is the ish. Smells amazing. Soaks right into your skin. Concealer melts into your skin on top of it, and fine lines ARE plumped up, and diminish a bit over time. I'm walking proof it does. If your oily, acne prone like me, try this eye bomb out. Get you a sample from Sephora. You will run to the store and buy the full size as soon as you realize how good this baby really is. Pair it with other Belif products for the best results too. I highly recommend!!\n",
      "Line331: I really enjoyed this under eye moisturizer u just didn’t believe this transformed my under eyes. Good product not great. Very gentle and soothing.\n",
      "Line332: I purchased this cream because I am in love with their moisturizing bomb (saved my skin). I have been noticing fine lines due to dryness under my eyes, and my makeup has not been sitting as well under the eye. I've been using this for about a month now and I can say that the fine lines have gone away (I'm only 22 so I knew they were accentuated because of the dry skin). My makeup has been sitting much better and has not been flaking up or showing texture under the eye. This is my savior this winter. The only thing I would change about this is the packaging. The small jar is kind of inconvenient if you have even slightly long nails and I hate getting product under my nails. But, because of how much this helps I will disregard that. This is a pricey eye cream but it is no joke. Belif's products live up to their claims, and i'd feel comfortable recommending this to anyone with dry skin and sensitive under-eyes.\n",
      "Line333: I bought this because of the rave reviews and because it was new on Sephora and I’m a sucker for eye creams. I think you get a good value considering you get 10 ml more than a typical eye cream. I’d recommend!\n",
      "Line334: I've been using this twice a day for about 3 weeks or so and I've definitely notice that the little fine lines next to my eyes are diminished. I think the biggest factor in that is that the Moisturizing eye bomb is the perfect combination of moisturizing (of course) with a nice texture and enough substance to stick around all day or night. I love the packaging and the size is very generous. I'm used to eye creams in little jars, but this one is a much more generous size and I've barely made a dent in it. It is a gel cream texture, not oily, and it absorbs well, but also protects the eye area so your skin doesn't just suck it up and leave the area dry again. It really does last for at least 10 hours or so I'd say, probably longer if you're not in the dry, cold atmosphere I'm dealing with right now. I received this product free to test and review from Influenster. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",

      "Line343: Way too overpriced for the amount of the product. It smells good and hydrates and moisturizes. The packaging and the colors are okay pretty. I honestly believe you can find better eye creams than this. Caffeine induced products do better. I wouldn’t purchase again unless I had extra money.\n",

For someone who doesn’t have sensitive skin I would recommend!\n",

It does not leave unfavorable reactions, and with a constant routine you will see the results.\n",

      "Line363: ¡Me encanta esta crema para los ojos!  Probablemente el mejor que he probado hasta ahora.  Mi vieja crema para ojos era una marca decente que también vende Sephora, pero no se compara con esta.  Con otras cremas para los ojos, mi área debajo de los ojos todavía estaba un poco seca solo una hora después de la aplicación, y esta realmente se hidrata.  Se siente relajante y como una hidratación refrescante para el área debajo de los ojos: la hidratación dura todo el día, y estoy feliz de haber comprado esto.  Solo lo he estado usando durante unos días y he notado una mejora en mis círculos súper oscuros debajo de los ojos.  Sin embargo, no estoy seguro de lo bueno que es prevenir las arrugas / líneas finas para el área debajo de los ojos, lo cual es una preocupación mía, por lo que podría colocar un suero ocular antienvejecimiento debajo de esto.  Pero en general, estoy muy contento con mi compra, y esto también es genial para personas como yo que sufren de alergias terribles.  Me froto los ojos constantemente y soy muy alérgico a muchos tipos de hierba.  No irrita mis ojos y no arde mucho si me froto los ojos después de aplicar esto.  Súper contento de haber descubierto esto, pero eventualmente lo pondré con algo más debajo para obtener beneficios más fuertes contra el envejecimiento bajo los ojos.\n",

This is definitely one of them, considering that almost every eye cream gives me some kind of bad reaction.

My makeup goes on way smoother, however I haven’t noticed a large difference in the appearance of puffy under eyes, which is also a concern of mine\n",

I don’t have any real problems in my eye area, so it’s hard to say if this product did anything other than hydrating.\n",

      "Line386: I adore this!  I picked up a sample at Sephora.  It is gentle and layers beautifully over the serum I’ve been wearing around my eyes.  I am totally thinking of getting a full size when this runs out.  It’s a delight to wear.  I wore it with makeup the other night and everything went on smoothly - no creases, easy to apply, just lovely.\n",
      "Line387: It is moisturizing but a little tick for me. I have just been using it for a week but haven’t seen any difference yet. Will keep you posting.\n",
      "Line388: wow i wish i had the money to buy more of this eye cream. amazing. so gentle and scent free and moisturizing and cruelty free. i had a deluxe sample and loved it so much, my skin looked so refreshed in the morning\n",
      "Line389: This eye cream is one of this best eye moisturizer I have ever used. It is great for puffy eyes and the thick nature of it makes is easy to apply and doesn't take much for the great effect. It is effective. I will definitely be buying again when I run low. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Line390: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is a great product. It really works well. I have been experimenting more with eye creams lately, because I am now in my late 30s. This one is hands down the best that I have tried.\n",
      "Line391: I received my 5ml sample in my August Ipsy glam bag.  it doesn't look like much, but it's eye cream  (and a good one ) so you don't need much.  I have been using nightly just short of a month,  and I am  SHOOK!!♡♡♡ I wish I did a before,  and after.  The results are great,  and almost a month in I still have more than half a tiny jar. FEEL FREE TO CHECK OUT IPSY THRU MY LINK ♡♡. #IPSY #Belif #voxbox #influenster  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb #skinesetials\n",
      "Line392: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb I got this sample on ipsy and I'm so in love with it. I Have several dark circles under my eyes and this really help reduce puffy dark under eyes and moisturize that delicate area. I use this on my day and night routine. When finish this sample. Definitely going to buy more...\n",
      "Line393: I love this product! I can feel it working as soon as I put it on and could tell small differences the next day! I also love the fact that it is made from natural ingredients. This product worked out better than I expected and I would definitely purchase it agian.\n",
      "Line394: I love an eye cream that I can also use as an eye mask. This fits the bill. It is such a light, airy texture that it really absorbs well but I can also use it to mask when my skin is deathly dry. The package size seems a little large, but honestly, in an eye cream, anything larger than a deluxe sample seems grossly oversized. It takes forever to get through a single container of eye cream! But this one is really lovely and the price point is quite nice. Overall I think it's a good value and a solid performer.\n",
      "Line395: I received a sample of this in a subscription box and I am OBSESSED with this stuff. I have used it every single day since receiving it. I have sensitive skin and have not experienced any burning or discomfort while using. I have noticed a difference under my eyes, less puffy in the morning. Would buy again! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line396: I really like this eye balm. It’s thick and long lasting and keeps your under eye area very hydrated.\n",
      "Line397: THIS STUFF IS SO GOOD! I got a small sample in my ipsy bag for August and I'm honestly upset tht I liked it so much because it is a little pricey. But it's honestly too good to resist buying the full size!\n",
      "Line398: I had a makeup artist tell me to use this before doing my makeup and it changed my life. Also it's so beautiful on its own, my eyes look so dewy. my eyes don't get watery or get little bumps under my eyes. So gentle!\n",
      "Line399: I do love it. I feel my eyes área very moisturizer. I have very dry skin and that zone is not too firm any longer, so i hope it works. It smells amazing\n",
      "Line400: My first impression on this product is that you feel your eyes getting refresh Automatically. 🧖🏼‍♀️ I like the smell and my eyes really appreciate it . Will buy it later . I got it in my Ipsy bag\n",
      "Line401: I really like this product. It has a nice texture and feels super moisturizing. It leaves my eyes feeling so smooth and moisturized! I wouldn't say that it reduces the appearance of eye wrinkles, or even fine lines though. I'm in my early 20s and notice some small fine lines around my eyes already, and no product will actually make them disappear as they claim, so if that is why you are looking to buy this product, I wouldn't. If you are simpling looking for a good gentle eye cream, then this product is great.\n",
      "Line402: I wasn’t really impressed with the moisturizer I received from this brand but I was excited when I saw I was going to get this eye bomb cream because of its raving reviews. The texture is incredible and deeply nourishes my eyes. It is perfect for a night routine! I love the way it feels and cools around my puffy tired eyes. I also love how it smells!\n",
      "Line403: I’m on the fence about this eye cream, it does work really well for hydration but It doesn’t work underneath makeup. It pills really bad and makes my concealer look splotchy. I use it mainly at night now but It still pills if I happen to rub at eyes, almost like it doesn’t sink in. For the price I don’t think I’ll repurchase.\n",
      "Line404: This is one of my favorite eye creams. I am in love with the texture of this cream. It's very rich and moisturizing, true to its name. It absorbs fast. While it's very hydrating and I instantly feel an energized plump effect, I haven't noticed any long term benefits with this eye cream.\n",
      "Line405: I don’t know why I waited so long to try this #eyecream the name fits perfect cause it’s #bomb I love it! It leaves your eye area so hydrated and moisturized without feeling greasy. Please everyone give it a try! You won’t regret it. And for the price I think you get quite a lot of product so definitely worth it!!!\n",
      "Line406: I have not tried many eye creams, but this one tops all others and my expectations. Instantly, I can see color correction, inflation decrease, and an overall hydrated look. Within a couple days/weeks of using it - I started to noticed my crows feet on my eyes decreasing as well!! When I cry, I can put this on my eye and it will make it look like I haven’t been crying at all. So moisturizing. You do not need a lot! A little goes a long way and can last a lot. The price is high, but it does truly last so long. Here is a picture before (left) and after application (right) just after only a minute of having it on.\n",
      "Line407: Another product from this company that I'm absolutely in love with this is one of the most moisturizing eye creams that I have come across and trust me I've tested a lot it's extremely affordable and most definitely does not lack in performance you will definitely start seeing a difference in about seven days it reduces looks of fine lines and wrinkles and puffiness around the eyes.. definitely a go to products definitely would recommend to others\n",
      "Line408: I got this as a sample in one of my Sephora purchases and I really enjoyed this product. It is extremely hydrating for the under-eyes, although I did notice it made my skin feel slightly more greasy afterwards. I have oily acne-prone sensitive skin so I typically stay away from products that tend to make me feel greasy at the end of the day. For all the dry skin gal’s out there I think this product would be bomb for you! It is very hydrating and has a nice scent when applying it to your under-eyes.\n",
      "Line409: Another great Ipsy bag find! So I'd never heard of Belief before this cream arrived and I'm impressed, ended up buying a beginner set from them to try more of the products out. This eye cream was super moisturizing, applied well without feeling greasy and had next to no scent.\n",
      "Line410: This product I received it in the traveling kit from belief and this cream has helped me moisturize my eyes and I don’t look as dead as I usually look. Really like it and highly recommend you guys to buy it !\n",
      "Line411: BEST EYE CREAM THERE IS. This stuff is magic. It got rid of my fine line, dry skin, and rough texture within a couple uses. I really like all of the belif products. Definitely will recommend to anyone looking for a hydrating eye cream.\n",
      "Line412: It must be noted, that my first skincare product from the Belif brand I have got from the Influenster! I have already written a review about this product and my mind still the same. Even though I have used two more pots of this cream. For my pretty young skin, it suits well. It moisturizes the skin good, and I have no problems with my next makeup on it. This cream is light but for me, it is enough even in winter time!\n",
      "Line413: I have used various eye products. This is by far my favorite! When you apply it (use your ring finger) it wakes your skin right up with a cooling hydrating effect. A little goes a long way. Your eyes will show the first signs of aging so it is important to use a product that works.. unless you want to risk fine lines.. I do feel like the product is a tad pricey but since a little goes a long way in the full picture it is not that bad. Using this under your foundation will help your make up last! When your skin is dry it pulls moisture from your makeup. This appears to fade your makeup. Instead of reapplying.. use an eye cream!\n",
      "Line414: I got this as a sample size from my Sephora play box & o how I fell in love with and went & got the full size & then got another sample from another play box...yay! This eye product hydrates and makes my under eye look so bright and healthy! Smooth and easy to blend, don et irritates the eye at all and just simple to use.\n",
      "Line415: I actually really like this. It is very thick so you don't need to use a lot and it really is hydrating.  Pros: Incredibly thick balm. Truly does moisturize around the eyes.  Cons: It's a little pricey.\n",
      "Line416: I use this at night but also sometimes during the day( it’s light enough to wear under makeup) provides great hydration for under the eye\n",
      "Line417: I love this product and have used it previously. This product is lightweight and you can see the affect of it a few minutes after application. After application you can feel the hydration happening under your eyes. I love that this product doesn’t have an fragrance. #influenster #eye cream #hydrating  #sephora #belif #belifinhydration #honest #summer2020 #summerpicks #free #complimentary #voxbox #springintosummer #springintosummervoxbox\n",
      "Line418: This is by far my favorite eye cream! It Thick but not too thick. Really adds alot of hydration to the undereye.\n",
      "Line419: I was really hoping this was going to be one of my cult favorites but it fell short for me. It is a very light weight eye cream. However, I felt it did nothing for my under eye. Did it add moisture no, I felt it actually dried my under eye area out. The most I liked about the cream was that it was super light weight.\n",
      "Line420: SAVES YOUR UNDEREYES. If you have dry undereyes that when you put concealer on it looks dry, cakey and just not appealing, this moisturizer will help. After applying a pea sized amount under your eyes on day 2 I noticed such a difference in the texture and look of my undereyes. They looked very fresh and smooth and no longer dry. Concealer looks so much better and I just feel better overall. This works wonders on your eyes.\n",
      "Line421: I enjoy this eye balm, I usually apply it once my face is dry after my shower time. I really like the fact that it improves skin elasticity . The only flaw I would say it has is that it seems to get into my eyes without me even touching them, it could be something in the eye bomb that makes my eyes water, but once I try to scratch them the first time of course by this time it’s all in my eyes. So I’d maybe say be careful not to wear it in too hot weather due to extra sweating around the eye area\n",
      "Line422: Well, eye cream. I felt like it was a waste of money to be very honest. Having never used an eye cream before, except for my eye stick, I felt like I wasn't going to use it, but wasn't I wrong?!I brought this one to my dorm actually, so that I could use it there. Its a cute sample size. But it makes my eyes feel so hydrated!!!This eye cream has a rather strong herbal scent, which might not appeal to everyone. If you've already tried the Aqua Bomb, you're most likely already familiar with the scent. It's almost the same. I personally stop smelling it once it has absorbed into the skin. I don't mind the scent too much, but I get that others might not like it.The texture is very creamy and lightweight, and it sinks in really quickly. it does leave somem sort of balmy texture behind though, but you only notice it when you touche it with your finger. It makes my skin smooth and hydrated. I am a big fan!\n",
      "Line423: Pretty good but SO overpriced! I got a sample of this in my Sephora Play! box and it was nice, but not quite hydrating and firming as I like my eye creams to be. This isn't as good as my Innisfree Orchid Eye cream and is three times the price. You can get better eye creams for half the price of this.\n",
      "Line424: LOVEE THIS CREAM! One of my favorites . I use it almost every night and I love the texture.\n",
      "Line425: I got this in a subscription box and was super excited because belif The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb is my favorite moisturizer ever.  I’ve been testing out this eye cream and I love it.  It’s hydrating, but it’s not too thick where you cannot wear it under makeup. It feels so good when applied too, it’s kind of thin and spreads easily and absorbs really well.\n",
      "Line426: Great stuff! It has made such a difference with my makeup routine by smoothing out the texture wrinkles underneath my eyes. Now my foundation and my concealer go on so much smoother. It's such a hydrating product I really like it.\n",
      "Line427: Super easy to apply. It’s light weight and not heavy. Packaging is sooo cute as well! I got this in one of my monthly subscription boxes and fell in love! Def can see a difference in my eyes and it’s helped with the dark circles and leaves my under eyes sooo soft!\n",
      "Line428: First of all belif is one of my favorite skincare brands. I love their toners and hydrating moisturizers. I like this eye cream a lot but all it did to me after trying it the past 6 weeks daily was it kept my under eyes moisturized, hydrated and smooth. It helped a lot with this cold winter weather. I don’t think it did anything with my fine lines or brightened up my under eyes. I would recommend it to someone who is looking for an eye cream that hydrates your eyes and keep them smooth. I have normal to dry skin and my skin gets a lot dryer in the winter when it’s cold outside. I personally would consider purchasing it when it’s cold outside since my skin gets dryer around this weather and it needs a lot of hydration. If you are like me and looking for products that reduce your fine lines and brighten up your eyes then this might not be your number one option but if you are looking for hydration then this is your product.\n",
      "Line429: I was very moisturizing as promised. A little goes a long way so this product will last you a long time.\n",
      "Line430: Love this! The texture is amazing, it absorbs fast, and my eyes look great thanks to it! :)\n",
      "Line431: This is one of those products that I did not fully appreciate until I was out of it. I used it during the winter, both night and day, and it left my under eye area so moisturized! It wasn't too heavy or too light, which made it perfect for night or day use. Would repurchase and would recommend!\n",
      "Line432: This is the only eye cream that I see any noticeable results with. It is so lightweight, yet it is super potent and packs a punch of hydration. I have very dark circles, this is the only product that noticeably brightens them.\n",
      "Line433: I received this eye cream from Influenster in a vox box. I already love the Belif brand so I knew this would be a great product. I love this eye cream! I have always suffered from dark under eye circles and puffiness in the morning. It's hard to find a cream that doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes or make my concealer look bad over it. Not only does this cream hydrate, smooth, and soothe my eyes but concealer looks great over it! No creasing and no dryness! Plus it feels so cool and refreshing on the skin. Definitely recommend it and I will be purchasing another jars when it's gone.\n",
      "Line434: I love this product! The belief Moisturizing Eye Bomb was sent to me complimentary to test out from Influenster. It has exceeded all of my expectations. It truly does moisturize my eye area as well as plump up my fine lines. This cream wears great all day long and works excellent under my concealer. I will definitely be purchasing this product in the future.\n",
      "Line435: This is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used.You don't have to use a whole lot for it to be effective.I use quite a variety of sephora products.You definitely get what you pay for with this product!\n",
      "Line436: I have been loving the belif products so much lately. They're so great on the skin. I've had so many problems with skincare products making my skin oilier then it already is. These don't do that! Love love\n",
      "Line437: This eye balm is so soothing and give so much moisture ! I love this and how lovely this feels on the skin ! Great formula\n",
      "Line438: This is one of the best face cream I ever had. It so rich and moisturizing that it is worth every ounce that it costs. It is so effective in keeping my skin moisturize and soft. For the value, I can say it is worth it and I will recommend this to all of my friends. I will buy it again definitely!\n",
      "Line439: Love this is much works amazing just what it says it does it does !!!! You need this in your life the price is very agreed\n",
      "Line440: This eye cream works pretty well. It removed all puffiness under my eyes. It also made all the time lines disappeared as well. It felt very light weight and goes on really easy and makes your eye area very smooth and soft getting rid of all your troubling dry areas.\n",
      "Line441: I got it as a sample for my points from Sephora. Not good, bot bad . To me it gave a zero hydratation , but also didnt irritate at all. I am 34 y old. I need smthg stronger with action, i guess… and more nourishing. The texture of this guy is very very light! So i suppose it will work very good for somebody on their 20s!\n",
      "Line442: I really love to try this Produkt for me. I really need fory eyes a refresh. #Influenster #voxbox i hope i will try it soon. Thank you!\n",
      "Line443: My eyes drank it uppppp. I first tried it a sample with purchase with the full size bomb moisturizer. Then I enjoyed it and got a full size bottle. Make sure to close it all the way bc I get so lazy and it gets dried easily :(\n",
      "Line444: This is nice and moisturizing, unscented which is preferable for skin care. I don't think it does much else for my under eye area but it doesn't hurt to moisturize. I'm just not sure I'd spend the money on it to purchase again. Packaging is attractive.\n",
      "Line445: I received a sample of this product for free from Influenster to review. I greatly enjoyed it. You only need one or two light taps of the product. It doesn’t take much at all to moisturize under your eyes.\n",
      "Line446: I have been using this for a month and a half day and night. This eye cream is great to keep under eyes moisturized and I really enjoy the creamy gel consistency. It is a tiny bit greasy, and does take a bit to absorb. While I like it -- it's not life changing.  I think it does help lightly with dark circles. I didn't notice anything change while using it as far as firmness or fine lines. I'm not sure I would pay the $50 for this after testing it out a month. The Dr Brandt DNA peptide eye cream gives me way more hydration than this one does but, it's also almost twice the price. I don't have sensitive skin but I have reactive skin. I didn't notice any redness or irritation.\n",
      "Line447: My gf uses it and I have been using some of hers and really enjoy it and find it moisturizing.\n",
      "Line448: I wanted to like this product but I just didn't see the results I wanted. The gel itself is lightweight af, cool & soothing. Not for someone looking to undo some damage. More for maintenance\n",
      "Line449: Absolutely loveeeeeee this line of products! As I tend to get oily these gel type moisturizers work well for me as they keep me hydrated without a greasy feeling left behind. Excellent brand!\n",
      "Line450: This product really helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles. It smells good and is easy to use. I have noticed my eyes look and feel brighter and less wrinkled.\n",
      "Line451: I got this in my allure beauty box and I already ordered a full size!!!! I love getting makeup and skincare subscriptions because if I love something I just go out and buy it and now I see this is an Influenster 2020 fave . Lol well it's one of my faves too!!! Thank you Allure ..\n",
      "Line452: I really do like this ice cream. It’s expensive so I rarely ever buy it but it really does do wonders￼\n",
      "Line453: I was dealing with dry spots on my eyelids during the dry winter season and I found this eye cream to be the best at hydrating! It truly lives up to its name in that it provides a moisture bomb. I love the more watery consistency as it makes it lightweight, easy to apply and soaks in so quickly!\n",
      "Line454: I LOVE all belif products ! I always have atleast two on hand because I’m scared to run out ! The price can be expensive individually but there are often gift sets I buy which allows me to have all their products at a great price! This makes my skin feel so moisturizer, the eye cream is very soothing! I love it !\n",
      "Line455: A very lightweight formula that absorbs quickly into skin. I have very dry under eyes, and although this does hydrate, it has not been the holy grail for my dry, tired eyes. I like to keep it on hand as a back up for those less dry days. You only need a small bit so the product lasts a long time.\n",
      "Line456: I have tried many eye creams from different brands and this one tops them all! It is so moisturizing and leaves my eye area hydrated. This and their aqua bomb cream and sleeping mask are a permanent part of my regimen.\n",
      "Line457: Love using this before bed. I wake up feeling fresh and super hydrated but not greasy. Planning to continue using this in the future!\n",
      "Line458: Use this daily with my face cream. Glides on super smooth and is not sticky at all. Very hydrating and smells great too!\n",
      "Line459: Didn't notice a difference at all. Has a scent. made me break out and my eyes got red, itchy and irritated. Wouldn't purchase again.\n",
      "Line460: This product is amazing. Goes on so nice. Very moisturizing. I don’t think it helps much with wrinkles but I would still use it.\n",
      "Line461: Such a light and fluffy eye moisturizer. It is really soothing (I recommend keeping it in the fridge if you’re puffy). It also does not have much of a scent, perfect for sensitive skin, definitely a great go to product.\n",
      "Line462: LOVE this eye cream!  It's super hydrating and versatile for both night and day.  I've recommended it to several friends who also rave about it.\n",
      "Line463: Super hydrating for that delicate eye area. Use at night and under makeup. Feels refreshing and soothing. A little goes a long way.\n",
      "Line464: This is a great eye cream. It is not too heavy so it can be great for under makeup but it is still hydrating enough for nighttime.\n",
      "Line465: Most moisturizing and hydrating eye cream EVER. If you are super dry, this also helps to put a little on your face and it will be baby soft! It’s their best product.\n",
      "Line466: Probably the most hydrating eye cream I’ve ever used! A thicker cream especially good for the winter cold months! I apply this right before concealer and it goes on so smoothly!belif\n",
      "Line467: Good moisturizing lightweight daytime eye cream. Good for under makeup and plumps under eye\n",
      "Line468: Just a beautiful finish under any product and just on it’s on at night works beautifully! Love how my eyes look during and after use of this gel!\n",
      "Line469: This is a wonderful eye cream if looking for intense hydration. I have used a full sized jar and have not seen any other effects - did not lighten dark circles, or decrease wrinkles but did a fantastic job moisturizing!!! Did not aggrevate eyes  which is a common issue with my eyes!  Great feel and scent. Highly recommend if moisture is what your eyes crave!\n",
      "Line470: Love this product! Actually, I’m a big fan of their gel moisturizer too. Melts into my skin and never seems to make my eyes burn like to many other eye creams. Received this as a sample and then bought the full size.\n",
      "Line471: I used to have deep dark circles around my eyes until I started using the eye bomb. it's definitely worth the money to buy it and use it As a daily cream.\n",
      "Line472: This is my go-to eye cream. Very moisturizing and it absorbs quickly. The container lasts a long time and I like to buy the little travel sets so I have a small one in my travel bag. ￼￼\n",
      "Line473: This eye cream feels awesome on the skin! It preps my under-eye area for concealer beautifully. It temporarily will plump up the sallow part of my under-eye that needs it the most and it makes my eyes appear to be more awake and youthful while wearing it.\n",
      "Line474: Super moisturizing! I loved using this before bed or under my makeup. It made my under eye skin feel hydrated\n",
      "Line475: I just recently started to notice that under my eyes were not getting enough moisture, and this product really did the trick with adding moisture without irritation! In the past, I’ve found that some products are either very heavy or burn, but this one has been perfect! It’s great because it moisturizes enough to where I’ve noticed that the lines under my eyes are no longer as visible, but is light enough to wear under makeup. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Line476: This product is definitely very hydrating! I think it’s great for hydration, I wish it had more benefits to it like brightening or anti-aging but over all a good hydrating eye cream. Not something I would reach for again.\n",
      "Line477: I got a mini version of this and used it until it was done! Its a great eye moisturizer to use for your AM and PM skin routine\n",
      "Line478: This feels so good on my eyes and is very moisturizing, The price point is amazing. I could see this possibly replacing my tried and true Estée Lauder. It absorbs super fast and plumps up the fine lines around my eyes shaving at least 5 years off my face.\n",
      "Line479: Einer der besten Augencremes die ich probiert hab! Beruhigt die Haut, versorgt sie mit Feuchtigkeit und Schwellungen werden gemildert. Hatte bislang keine Probleme mit ihr.\n",
      "Line480: Use this everyday under my eyes mornings and night and I no longer have dry cracked skin on the sides of my eyes!\n",
      "Line481: Really like this one. I use it for hydration since my eyes get dry due to eczema. I love how it feels so cool when you apply it. It’s gentle on the skin. I wish it helped with dark circles😭. It’s great and it’s affordable.\n",
      "Line482: This feels nice under the eyes - it has a little bit of a thicker cream consistency which I wasn’t expecting based on the Aqua Bomb moisturizer from Belif. My under eyes feel hydrated and pretty smooth - it doesn’t sink into the skin 100%, but just enough where I would hope makeup would sit nicely on top of this in the AM.\n",
      "Line483: I love this eye cream. It’s truly so moisturizing and definitely helps prevent signs of aging. Belif products are the best out there.\n",
      "Line484: Perfect eye moisturizer! It smells fresh and a little bit goes a long way. I’ve only used samples so far but I’ll definitely add it to my next purchase\n",
      "Line485: mi crema hidratante es muy buena y te deja la piel fresca limpia y suave me gusta su textura y tiene un olor que por lo particular a mi me gusta mucho se los recomiendo y no cambiaria nada\n",
      "Line486: It does feel hydrating but I just don’t see any other benefits with this product. If all you need Is under eye hydration, then go for It !\n",
      "Line487: Best eye cream ever! It’s so smooth and hydrating. I love the whole Belif skin care line.\n",
      "Line488: Hydrantant et parfait pour les yeux sensibles! Je ne peux dire par contre si cela a un impact sut les signes de l’âge puisque que je ne l’utilise pas depuis assez longtemps pour voir une différence\n",
      "Line489: Love this eye cream for day time under my eyes keeps my skin moisturized and doesn’t effect my makeup application\n",
      "Line490: Literally my favorite eye cream. a little pricey but definitely worth it. It’s so hydrating and exactly as advertised. I’ll probably purchase this the rest of my life lol\n",
      "Line491: I love this eye cream so much. One of the best I’ve ever tried. I initially got this as a sample but decided to buy the full sized product. This eye cream feels so luxurious and moisturizing yet lightweight. There’s significant difference in how my undereye area looks since I started using this product.\n",
      "Line492: The perfect eye cream under makeup. It’s a light gel but still really moisturizing. The price isn’t cheap so although I liked it, it wasn’t anything mind blowing for me to repurchase this. Overall good eye cream if you are willing to splurge or don’t have wrinkles yet :)\n",
      "Line493: A little product goes a long way. I have been using this product for a while and it moisturizes my undereye area really well. I will consider repurchasing, because it is a pricey product\n",
      "Line494: I like this! It’s nothing that is life changing but it does a great job hydrating and sits well under makeup. I’d say it’s a great starter eye cream\n",
      "Line495: The product itself is great! Very hydrating and feels nice to the touch. I knocked off a star because while the blue part of the component is nice and heavy glass, the cap is just cheap plastic! For the price I want the experience to feel more luxurious.\n",
      "Line496: This stuff is amazing! Feels amazing on the skin. Is a little bit pricey but is worth it and you use very little! Plus I like the smell and clean scent.\n",
      "Line497: I really like the light texture of this! I received a free sample of it in one of my subscription boxes and became a fan of it. It is gentle and really leaves a nice impression under my eyes. I don’t know if I would purchase the full size one but it definitely wasn’t a disappointment. I keep it in my fridge for a nice cooling effect.  Highlights: • provides intense moisture (for up to 26 hours) • boosts elasticity ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼\n",
      "Line498: Love this cream! Its moisturizing but light weight and doesn't feel like its clogging my pores. My eyes look brighter and less tired which what we all want right? Looking forward to trying the cleansing balm next.\n",
      "Line499: I’m a big fan of belief products! This is a great moisturizer for the eye area, especially now in the cold winter months when my skin tends to really dry out. I like to use it in the morning and really makes my eyes look and feel more awake.\n",
      "Line500: La crema ha una consistenza leggera e fresca, dovrebbe essere idratante ed io privandola da mesi posso dire di non aver notato molta differenza sul contorno occhi per quanto riguarda la sua idratazione  Non penso che la ricomprerò in futuro.\n",
      "Line501: this is probably my favorite of all the eye creams i've tried over the years - which is almost a shame because it's so expensive for something i don't consider THAT important to my routine yet. but if i was going to drop major money on an eye cream, it'd be this one! it didn't erase my dark circles but it did a pretty good job of lessening them.\n",
      "Line502: Another great product that I had the pleasure of trying a sample of. Belif can be a tad expensive but I do think ther products are good and are worth the price tag! You definitely need a staple eye cream and this is close to becoming mine\n",
      "Line503: This feels sooooo amazing . I was sent it free from influenster and I will buy it from now on. It feel soothing when applying . It’s the right amount of thickness . I look forward to applying this everyday!\n",
      "Line504: I really enjoy this eye balm it's a part of my nightly routine it keeps under eyes soft and plump with no dry patches works nice under concealer to. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Line505: This eye cream is the literally the bomb!!! I'm a sucker for eye creams and toners and my eye cream collection is ridiculously large! It is super moisturizing.\n",
      "Line506: I love the texture and consistency of this eye cream. Its a little thick but in a silky way so it doesnt feel too heavy\n",
      "Line507: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb ok so I actually like this one and when I used it awhile back I immediately saw my under-eyes depuffing like instant so I had to jump on this. Its very rich and fast absorbing.  If you want results I suggest get on this like today. The whole brand is great and all their products I love\n",
      "Line508: Hands-down, one of the best eye creams I’ve used. It had a similar texture to the tatcha silk eye cream which is my #1 fav. It is light enough to wear under makeup, but still packs on the moisture.\n",
      "Line509: This formula feels great on the eye- not too heavy but not too light either. My eyes look refreshed when the next day when I use this at night\n",
      "Line510: Lo llevo utilizando ya 3 meses en mi rutina nocturna eh visto un gran cambio ..me ayudado con el cansancio de mis ojeras siento más lúcida el área de mis ojos\n",
      "Line511: One of my favorite eye cream￼ it’s literally amazing keep my under eye area smooth in a very short time ￼\n",
      "Line512: SOOOO I am an makeup artist and I love bold eyeshadow looks but genetically I have visibly VERY dark eye bags around my whole eye and because I wear a lot on my eye ( primer, concealer , shadow.. etc) my eyelids have become SO patchy .. ughhh and I never wanted to splurge on an eye cream but somehow I got convinced I need a good one regardless of the price because I need it to work. Eyeshadow wouldn’t even stick to my eyes because how much they were dry and within one day of using this my eyes have become brighter, so much softer and overall so hydrated and happy and I couldn’t ask for a better product. I love the sheseido eye cream but that’s wayyyy over my budget . You should try this out for yourself . Comes with such a generous amount as well! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line513: This is a pretty nice eye cream but I feel like it doesn't really do anything for me long term. It hydrates nicely and makes my under eyes look relatively smooth but I can still see all the fine lines and my dark circles just look wet lol. I like it and use it often as I've received multiple samples of this but it's just not the best eye cream I've tried.\n",
      "Line514: Keeps my undereye hydrated and ready for makeup application. Its a little pricey but the jar will last a long time.  I use it every night and in the morning.\n",
      "Line515: I really like this eye gel cream . It is very soothing and fresh under the eyes. Very. Very refreshing. I also liked that I had no allergic reaction. So if you have sensitive skin I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Line516: Loving the jelly feeling. Good with makeup and not creating creases under eye. Small jar goes for a long time. Maybe a little tool take product from the jar will be good for long nail ladies :)\n",
      "Line517: A very hydrating eye balm that I loved using in the morning. Lightweight, no scent, and left my eyes feeling nice. I have no complaints besides the price point. A good eye product!\n",
      "Line518: I tried this a few times it’s hydrated an full of moisture but I just don’t like the feel of this on my face and to me it felt a little sticky I didn’t care for that as much cute packaging but just not my cup of tea\n",
      "Line519: This product really reduced my puffy eyes. And brightens my eyes from looking like a zombie every time. If u want to try it then go ahead it is worth it. Nice packaging and is effective\n",
      "Line520: I am a big fan of Belif products. This is an awesome eye bomb. I use it before going to sleep. It makes the under eye areas and eyelids hydrated and I feel refreshed. Much better than other eye creams I have used! Definitely recommend! #influensteraward2020\n",
      "Line521: It has helped me lot, usually use in night and I pay much more, keeps me eyes hydrated and fresh, use simply amounts when it comes to that aplicare make-up, but my in personally I will good to be honest\n",
      "Line522: This is my favorite 2020 eye moisturizer. It applies smooth with immediate results. I highly recommend you buying this product.   belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line523: 😍😍😍I use this every time I wash my face which even though it says it's good for up to 26 hours, I still reapply because who wants dry skin around their eyes? I have not experienced any irritation with this and I have sensitive skin. So if you want to try a new eye cream go for this one!\n",
      "Line524: Similar to the aqua bomb I find this moisturizer to be light and leaves eyes feeling refreshed\n",
      "Line525: Completely eliminates creasing! Perfect primer for under eyes. Better than any other primer or eye cream I have tried. I wish that it did more for puffiness and dark circles though. Its hydrating, works perfectly under makeup but it doesn’t do much else. I look for a hydrating, firming eye cream that minimizes the look and feel of puffy, tired eyes. I have other hydrating eye creams that are just as hydrating.. they don’t make such a beautiful canvas for my concealer though! I would use a more potent eye cream at night but considered using this during the day because it’s so good under my concealer. It has such a lightweight, fresh feel and scent. This really does what it says but it’s just not right for me, I decided to go for a do it all eye cream instead!\n",
      "Line526: I got this as a sample from Sephora. I like the cream to gel formula and it has a nice beachy floral scent. My main concern is dark circles and this is definitely not targeted at that but rather hydration and fine lines.\n",
      "Line527: Super moisturizing jelly consistency. Perfect for puffy eyes in the morning. The best eye cream I’ve tried so far.\n",
      "Line528: mis sueños quedan seguros pues en la noches está crema hidrata mis zona de ojos para lucir radiante durante todos el día es de muy buena y te ayuda mucho con estos problemas además e prevenir líneas indeseadas desde la primer aplicación es buenisisma\n",
      "Line529: I love eye cream and love this brand so it was a win win. I do not use this particular product for anti aging but I do use it to moisturize my eye area. So its good in the morning and also goes well under makeup. I would recommend this product for moisturizing the eye area.\n",
      "Line530: I love this eye cream. It makes my under eye hydrated and smooth. I felt like it’s improving the texture of the skin too. Well goes under makeup. Help calm dryness and flakiness. Love consistency and cute packaging. It’s pricey though. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line531: This helps a lot with darker under eyes, if your skin is on the drier side I would definitely recommend this!\n",
      "Line532: Es diseñado proporcionar elastisidad en el area de los ojos resfreca y difumina las primeras lineas de expresion ideal para todas las pieles\n",
      "Line533: Great eye moisturizer. It feels cool going on and helps my makeup apply smooth around my eyes. I received it in an Allure box, so Allure gets credit again for introducing me to a great product\n",
      "Line534: I struggle with dark circles and I found this to be the most helpful eye cream to improve my dark circles and my fine lines.￼ It is on the pricier side however I find that the value is completely worth it and the product lasts a long time. When you apply it it gives a refreshing feeling to your under eyes and makes your eyes feel more awake.￼￼\n",
      "Line535: Received this as a sample. Not particularly impressed...a bit too greasy for my preference, and additionally doesn’t seem to do a lot...still it’s heavy enough so it’s moisturizing to say the least. I’m unlikely to purchase this.\n",
      "Line536: Great product for the eyes. Goes on smooth, dries quick, and does feel like it’s tightening the eye area once it’s dry. A little goes a long way with this product.\n",
      "Line537: I have no under eye concerns. But I can tell you that his cream is nice and didnt irritate my skin. A little goes a long way. Medium thickness consistency.\n",
      "Line538: I expected more out of this. It was moisturizing but didn't really do what it claimed it would for the under eye area.\n",
      "Line539: I have tried a few of they're products I do recommend belief and do say so myself that my skin is left feeling so clean smooth and ultra soft. But u have to consistently use. I will repurchase.\n",
      "Line540: This should’ve lasted me along time but it only lasted me a short while because I loved using it so much. I liked the way it made the corners of my eyes feel. I always wake up with extremely dry skin and cracking around my eyes but this got rid of it in less than 3 weeks\n",
      "Line541: My favorite! Light yet extremely hydrating. Perfect for daytime as it sinks in quickly and works great underneath makeup.\n",
      "Line542: Smells exactly like the aqua moisturizing cream. My first time using it - really hydrated the under-eye area. It's super lightweight (perfect for the heat and summer). Would highly recommend buying the trial pack that they have at Sephora so you can try before buying!\n",
      "Line543: This is the best eye cream I’ve used so far! It’s a lighter gel cream texture but still very hydrating under the eyes. Comes in a large 25ml jar and will last forever since you only need a tiny bit. Wears well under makeup or as an overnight cream. Can’t comment on whether it helps dark circles (I don’t really have them) but it definitely keeps dry patches at bay and leaves my undereyes feeling plump!\n",
      "Line544: I bought this as part of a Belif Aqua Bomb tester set and I enjoyed all of the products. This eye balm is super moisturizing, goes on and absorbs well. Leaves my eye area well hydrated and the texture is fantastic. Youbelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb only need a small amount of product, it really goes a long way. I do recommend this product as well as the entire line of Belif Aqua Bomb products, they are really great products! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line545: Got this product from @influenster for FREE! It works like magic! Softens the eye lids and moisturizes. Anazing product.\n",
      "Line546: My absolute favorite eye cream ever! I have sensitive and dry under eyes and this is literally the bomb! I don’t know how I’ll ever live without it! Cute packaging as well!￼. This is super emollient, has a wonderful texture, no scent.￼\n",
      "Line547: Do yourself a favor and don’t spend $48 on this eye cream. I have dry eyelids and this did not keep them moisturized for 26 hours, like it claims. It didn’t even keep them moisturized for half the day. The Cerave Eye Repair Cream , Cetaphil Hydrating Eye Gel-Cream , or [product:mario-badescu-hyaluronic-eye-cream-14ml/05oz] are way better than this one and way cheaper. The only positive I have is the smell is nice and if you put it in the fridge if feels very cooling.\n",
      "Line548: A good hydrating eye cream. I would say it is very basic for an eye cream. It was gentle which I liked.\n",
      "Line549: Great eye cream I really like to use it, I put it under my eyes during the night and the next morning I’m like new.\n",
      "Line550: Very moisturizing and feels good on my eyes in general. I got this in a vox box and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and thickness.\n",
      "Line551: This little tiny bottle makes my eye feels like 2 years younger! I can’t believe it plumped the under part of my eye instantaneously after use and it felt hydrated all day! I don’t feel tired anymore even when going to sleep at 2am and getting only 5 hours sleep. Love it! 💕\n",
      "Line552: Best eye cream for dry eyes. It hydrates, plumps and helps with those dark circles. Feels very cooling on the under eye as well\n",
      "Line553: Belief Moisturizing Eye Bomb este eye cream 👁 te ayuda a humectar por 26 horas y proporciona elasticidad a tu piel #belifinhydration #contest #complimentary @belifusa @Influenster\n",
      "Line554: I really want this to work, but I can't use it. I don't think I have sensitive skin, but my undereye got very red and tingley after use. Eventually it actually started to hurt a little! Unfortunately, I can't keep using this. Maybe this would help my dark circles but I'd rather try a different eye cream.\n",
      "Line555: This is a great hydrating day time eye cream for summer. The formula is lightweight and helps my concealer looks smoother under my eyes. I love that it’s lightweight so you don’t feel it on at all! Also great for sensitive eyes and skin!\n",
      "Line556: Me encanta esta crema se siente súper suave al tacto, mi piel lo absorbe súper rápido y lo que más me gusta es que me hidrata la piel... Y cuando uso maquillaje se me ve hidratada de igual manera!!\n",
      "Line557: Really hydrating for how lightweight the product is! It’s a very light gel cream, sinks in quickly but is very hydrating and wears well under makeup. A little goes a long way so I’m still working my way through a sample for the past few months. It does have a heavy fragrance and I would prefer it to be in a squeeze tube so 1 star off. I can’t comment on whether it helps with lines and wrinkles since I don’t have this issue.\n",
      "Line558: My go to eye cream is belif eye bomb. Very light and not sticky. I would definitely recommend.\n",
      "Line559: Amazing!!! I have been using the aqua bomb for a face moisturizer for years so I was really excited about this product. I think it’s a great price for how much product you get and it’s really concentrated so you barely need to use any. It feels very moisturizing without feeling oily and makes me eyes feel so refreshed and hydrated.\n",
      "Line560: I love this stuff it lasts a long time and it’s perfect lightweight for summer or hotter weather makes indersyes plump and sinks in almost instantly\n",
      "Line561: This product was super smooth and awesome! The product helped my under eyes when I used it nightly. A great addition to my skincare routine!! I got this from the complimentary Spring Into Summer VoxBox!\n",
      "Line562: Love this eye bomb!!!! I apply this under my eyes before my moisturizer. It helps brighten my face and makes my skin feel so refreshed. I’ve noticed a huge difference since I started using this. A little dab of this goes a long way.\n",
      "Line563: Basically I love all skin care products which are water based and ofcourse this eye bomb is just perfect. I use it every night in my skin care routine and it has made a noticiable change to how my undereyes look like now and I am impressed.\n",
      "Line564: This is my go to eye cream for sure. A little goes a long way so it is definitely worth the money.\n",
      "Line565: Super amazing eye cream! I love it. It’s always refreshing putting it on under my eyes\n",
      "Line566: I love using this eye cream along with Belif face cream.It absorbs instantly under your eyes and they feel so moisturized and refreshed.I really love the fresh scent of this eye cream as well.The ingredients are fantastic as well.Under my eyes feel great when using this\n",
      "Line567: I love this under eye bomb I use it every time I do my glam looks it really hydrates the under eye if you have any fine lines or dryness. Gentle enough for sensitive skin! A little goes a long way, it really lasts !\n",
      "Line568: I got this with my moisturizer and I love it. It really keeps my under eyes hydrated. On the days I don't sleep well and I put this on and my eyes look so refreshed\n",
      "Line569: I really love this eye cream. It deeply hydrates the eye area and gently nourishes the skin. Also safe for sensitive skin\n",
      "Line570: I love this so much! Super east to apply and does the job super quick! Definitely recommend it for eye bags or dark circles. I wish it has a better smell but it's easy to get used to. Packaging is super easy to deal with! Definitely worth the price as well\n",
      "Line571: Love this eye cream . Its very good. Love Belif products. I will use over and over again . I need to buy sleep mask too\n",
      "Line572: I really liked this eye bomb. Little goes a long way. It’s super moisturizing and absorbs easily into the thin skin around my eyes. I would love it more if it didn’t have the fragrance.\n",
      "Line573: I got to try a variation of this from an influencer box I got I thought it was a great moisturizer I’ve used ones that I liked more tho. I have dry skin and I just love ones that keep my skin supple for longer than this did. For someone who likes product that soaks/absorbs in pretty quickly this would be the perfect fit for them￼.\n",
      "Line574: I really like the gel texture and how fast it absorbs into my skin. It is really hydrating. However, as much as I want to love it, I can smell the fragrance and it may have cause the tiny bumps (they are not red and do not hurt) around my eyes. I kinda regret trying it after I noticed the bumps. Thankfully I only got the free sample.\n",
      "Line575: I love anything skin care! After receiving this in my #SpringToSummerVoxbox I am in love! It is so lightweight and moisturizing especially for someone with combo skin!

      "Line576: This stuff is great. Highly recommend it! Love the texture and how it’s water based. My skin drinks this up when putting it under my eyes before bed! Feel very gentle on the skin. Probably won’t but it again bc of the price\n",
      "Line577: If you’re looking for a hydrating eye cream then this is for you! The value is great for a Korean brand & Belif is a great brand. Mostly for people looking to get rid of the dryness around the eye area but not for darkness. This is lightweight hydrating eye cream!\n",
      "Line578: I had never tried an under eye cream until I got this in my Voxbox. My favorite thing about it is the texture and how it feels on my skin. There's something very soothing about it that makes it feel luxurious. I also love how moisturized it leaves my skin feeling and the long lasting effect it has.\n",
      "Line579: So I literally just got this product today & let me just say it’s amazing. I put it on 40 mins ago and it still feels moisturized. It smells natural not like other products that have fragrances. I used a pea size drop for each eye, and trust me a little goes a long way. I love it and would definitely recommend it to you all💁🏻‍♀️👏🏽\n",
      "Line580: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb I’m pleasantly surprised how much I like this eye cream. It has a fresh scent and it feels refreshing as well! I’ve had dry patches on the edges of both eyes and this has helped alleviate them! I’m not sure it helped with puffiness, but then again I don’t think it claimed that on the packaging. Overall, I’d definitely recommend this product. #springintosummervoxbox\n",

      "Line584: This has been my regular eye cream for 3 empties now. I’m currently using a belif sister product (belif Peat Miracle Revital Eye Cream) which is just as good, but I think I’ll probably switch back over to this guy. It’s great prevention and keeps the under eye so hydrated! My concealer glides on after using this routinely!\n",

      "Line590: I got this in an ipsy bag and it’s one of my favorite eye creams ever. It’s really lightweight but still really hydrating. I’ve tried only a few eye creams, but all of them besides this one has been heavy or too thick. Just in general, they usually sit on the skin instead of getting absorbed (whatever you wanna call it). But the fill size is SO EXPENSIVE and I can’t find travel sizes or anything for sale. This is worth it to me (kinda, still haven’t purchased it) but I would just consider whether or not eye creams are that important to you. My under eyes are so dry, especially when I’m wearing makeup, and this one product really changed that for me. If that’s not a problem for you, there’s definitely cheaper options. The small one lasted me months too, so this will last you forever.\n",

      "Line593: I loved this lightweight eye cream, which definitely delivers a difference in the feeling and appearance of my under eye area! I always feel like eye creams are just expensive small containers of face moisturizer, but this cream made a noticeable difference in under eye hydration as well as improving fine lines. I love the belif brand, they have a forever customer in me!\n",
      "Line594: Love the long lasting moisturizing results with the product without the greasiness. This is the perfect complement to the belif true cream moisturizing bomb (which I also love) for the face. This product has the same fresh scent that leaves you refreshed after you put it on.  This product was received complimentary for testing purposes.\n",
      "Line595: I really loved this product! Super lightweight but moisturizing on my eyes, great for morning and night. Never made my eyes puffy from over moisturizing the undereye. It is expensive so I have not repurchased as my holy grail is the CeraVe eye cream which is much cheaper.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line596: I absolutely loooove this. My under eye area has been especially dry and tight feeling for quite some time now and after using this every day for the last couple of weeks has really helped my skin feel less tight, feels super soft and supple, and looks brighter to me. I would 10/10 recommend this to anyone wanting to try a new eye cream. Just the teensiest dab will do ya. 😎\n",
      "Line597: Love this! My eyes look so much better if I stay consistent with this. It doesn’t mix well with my make up so I usually use it when I just wear light makeup/ BB cream or at night. Love!\n",
      "Line598: Very gentle and soft around my eyes. It does not irritate it or get into my eye. I find my eyes to be super tight when I wake up the next morning! Also super adorable packaging with the blue color!\n",

      "Line602: Very moisturizing but no other benefits that I saw. Didn't see any improvements on my dark circles. I don't really have puffiness so can't comment on that.\n",
      "Line603: It’s very hydrating, and does reduce the fine lines under the eye. But didn’t really do anything for my dark circles.\n",

      "Line605: I got a small sample in my subscription to Luxebox. This is one of the worst eye creams I ever used. It was not moisturizing at all. It takes forever to sink in and pills underneath my makeup. Furthermore, it made my undereyes look dry and emphasized my lines whenever I wore concealer on top.\n",
      "Line606: I have purchased this eye cream 5 times. It’s so moisturizing and has helped to reduce my wrinkles. Will be repurchasing it for myselfa d as gifts for friends.belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line607: This moisturizer really surprised me. It feels so light yet it’s super hydrating. I was having really dry skin around my eyes due to allergies, so dry that it hurt... got this cream and wow! It took care of my eyes like no other. I love it and would totally recommend.\n",
      "Line608: Eye Cream - Belif is undoubtedly a favorite I've talked about in every post. (No, Belif doesn't really spend money on advertising and you share all your products with your own experience.) This is the morning routine I use...it's great....\n",
      "Line609: I love how refreshing this product feels on my eyes. I use this product day and night.\n",
      "Line610: Great eye cream. Very hydrating and soothing for my eyes. No color and fragrance. Did not break me out or cause bumps under my eyes. I like to use this once in the morning and once in the evening. Would recommend.\n",
      "Line611: I received this product in an Ipsy package, at first I didn't see much of a difference, but after a few days I really like it. It makes my eyes look very bright and it also makes them very smooth. I normally use first thing in the morning. Love this product and will be buying way more. 10/10.\n",
      "Line612: Okay, I know I  rave about many things. But this under eye cream has been sent from heaven. The results are immediate at restoring tired looking eyes and dark circles. Also it’s the best eye cream I’ve ever used and I’ve used many. Not even ROC is as good as this. The cream absorbs immediately and it lasts all day. Unlike other creams that tend to fade. The results last a full 12 hour day.\n",
      "Line613: Love the formula left my skin smooth and moisturized got to try this in my Ipsy glam bag totoally will be buying the larger size\n",
      "Line614: Very moisturizing but unsure if its doing anything for puffiness. I have genetic dark circles, as well as allergies that make it impossible for dark circles to disappear. Would reccommend but usually need another product to reduce puffiness\n",
      "Line615: I enjoy the cooling sensation upon initial application and I really love the fresh smell that Belif products have. I didn’t really see much result though.\n",
      "Line616: I really, really wanted to like this one but it just did not work for me. It was so sticky that it was not really doing anything. They need to work on that stickiness. I loved the way the packing looked. I would not buy again until it's reformulated. #skincare\n",
      "Line617: This is an amazing eye cream. It’s perfect for oily skin and combination skin. The water cream doesn’t leave your skin oily. It takes away the puffiness in your eyes.\n",
      "Line618: I love belif products in general because they are so thin in consistency yet apply well like a gel and deliver such a power punch of moisturizer that works well with my combination skin. I bought this moisturizing eye bomb after I had been using their facial moisturizer which is also so light weight and airy. I bought this with the sole intent of its burst of hydration hoping to prevent further crows feet and undereye lines. I am able to apply both morning and night and then use my SPF in the areas around it before continuing w my regular skincare regimen. I do you think that this has helped prevent further deepening of my crows feet and moistened my drier undereye skin￼.\n",
      "Line619: This eye cream is the eye moisturizing💣! It is very lightweight, goes on silky smooth and gives your eye area a burst of moisture. And also allows for a flawless makeup application! I would definitely recommend to others!\n",
      "Line620: Needed some serious help for my dry under eyes this winter, so I got myself a sample of this from Sephora and I'm so glad I did! Has the same smell as a lot of the other Belif products, but really helps hydrate under my eyes and keeps me looking fresh and awake.\n",
      "Line621: This eye bomb is the best eye cream ever! This is especially good if you put it I. The fridge overnight then use it in the morning! I definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for an eye cream that wakes you up!\n",
      "Line622: A must-have eye cream in my life! If you ever have dry under eyes and nothing is working, give this one a try! It's been a true life saver! A couple years ago I had severe dry under eyes and nothing would work. My under eyes were flaky af and I do live in the east coast. I tried everything from Drunk Elephant to your drug store products and then a friend of mine recommended this product and I haven't looked back since. I do switch up my eye creams just to see if anything else works better but I always come back to this one. It is a little pricey at $48 but it lasts me a long time because you don't need a lot of product to get the results!\n",
      "Line623: So far there hasn’t been a product of beliefs that I haven’t loved.  This eye “bomb” is a gel consistency, and it sinks in so nicely while hydrating your skin.  I have dry eye area and this does wonders for me.  Gel consistency is really nice compared to some heavy cream.\n",
      "Line624: I initially didn't really try this product.  I used it a few times inconsistently.  But I incorporated it into my morning and night routine.  I noticed that my eyes were very moisturized.  The fine lines were fading.  I see my dark circles are not as dark . It is a smooth balm, it absorbs well and doesn't sting.  I only with our was cheaper! I have the sample size and now I need more! 😭\n",
      "Line625: I really like Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. It’s light yet moisturizing. It’s not greasy and doesn’t smudge your eye make up.\n",
      "Line626: Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is exactly what it says it is. Super moisturizing! My eyes are very dry and this gel feels so nice under them. I put some on my eyelids also to hydrate them before makeup. I would definitely buy it again. It’s perfect for my skin type. I recommend it!\n",
      "Line627: So moisturizing and smooth, a little goes a very long way. No artificial smell, the only thing I would want out of this is for it to be a brightening eye cream. But other than that I would totally recommend to anyone suffering with dry under-eyes or eyelids!\n",
      "Line628: Best eye mask I’ve ever used ! so cooling and moistened feels the best ! I can’t believe how quickly my eyes were not dry anymore\n",
      "Line629: Very very very moisturizing eye cream! I received this on a subscription box and liked it!\n",
      "Line630: Very thick for a gel cream. Irritated my eyes because it tended to spread easily due to its texture.\n",
      "Line631: I got this in a sample size to try before committing and now I will definitely buy a full size of this. I’ve never been an eye cream gal just because I’m only 23 & I never saw the use....but this has changed my mind. It leaves my under eyes moisturized and my dark circles have dramatically changed.\n",
      "Line632: Now don't get me wrong this is pretty moisturizing.  It takes a while to dry down, it's fragranced (why do my eyes have to smell good?) and I now have a milia spot that won't go away. Personally I prefer the eye cream in the white jar by Belif if I had to choose one.\n",
      "Line633: I had a sample  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb of this from Sephora and I loved it. But I cant really give a huge review because I only used it for 2 weeks, but it worked and I could definitely see a change in my undereye area.\n",
      "Line634: While the texture of this product was nice, it was so fragrant that it made my eyes water. Not sure how the description can say it’s made without fragrance while “fragrance of natural origins” is also listed in the ingredients, including orange oil, which can be very sensitive to skin. Will not purchase again.\n",
      "Line635: Received this as a free sample at Sephora and after only a few uses I’ve seen such a difference in firmness. The moisture aspect is amazing as well. I’m in love. Sits well under my concealer too, consistency is dreamy. Will buy full size once I run out!!\n",
      "Line636: I received a deluxe size sample of this eye cream from Ipsy and was instantly hooked! It smells so light and refreshing, which I’ve come to expect from Korean Beauty products. It lives up to it’s name of “moisturizing eye bomb” as it left the skin around my eyes intensely hydrated, but not greasy. It’s gentle, which is very important to me with all skincare, especially anything going near my eyes. It’s quite pricey, but worth every penny. Also, a little goes a long way, so you won’t have to repurchase as often as you might think. Definitely recommend; it’s gold! A+ product!!\n",
      "Line637: This has that nice clean smell that a lot of belief products have and I love it for that, but it doesn’t do much for my dark circles(though it doesn’t really claim too). May be better for other eye concerns.\n",
      "Line638: Puffy eyes be gone!  Fine lines bye bye!  This eye cream is amazing.  No one will ever know you didn’t sleep a wink last night.  Feels amazing going on and I’m really impressed by  its efficacy.\n",
      "Line639: I like the texture and the amount of moisture I feel it brings to my under eyes. Besides the price point, I would buy this more often\n",
      "Line640: Really like eye non. I have puffy eyes.  It’s light. Not greasy.  And great for my dry skin follow up with moisturizer\n",
      "Line641: I’ve received this in a sample size from Sephora and enjoyed using it. I would purchase the full size.\n",
      "Line642: I really like this moisturizer. Under my eyes are constantly dry and this provides so much hydration. I use it right before bed. It’s not too thick and it absorbs pretty quickly. I also sometimes use a small amount under my concealer and it does a great job.\n",
      "Line643: Love this stuff. It feels so nice on your skin. Originally I was drawn to the pretty packaging, but have now found myself loving all the BELIEF products that I come across. Another bonus is the price point. Most “beneficial” eye creams/bombs are pretty pricey for a small amount of product. With Belief you get a large amount, that will last a while, for the same price or less!\n",
      "Line644: I love this eye cream. It is very moisturizing and melts into your skin. I love using this under concealer. I also love applying a thicker layer before bed. If you need a moisturizing eye cream, look no further.\n",
      "Line645: It works pretty well but I noticed that my eyes get puffy when I put this on at night before I go to bed (not sure why). So I only use this in the AM before makeup and seems work well.\n",
      "Line646: A little goes a long way with this eye cream. It's light and refreshing. I didn't like that it made my under eye concealer crease and come off though so I can only use it at night.\n",
      "Line647: I got this as a sample and I wasnt that impressed love the scent but I didnt feel it gave was all that moisturizing the consistency was nice its kinda like a gel and cream mixed if that makes sence\n",
      "Line648: Also got this is as a sample, but through Ipsy! Has the same gel formula, which is perfect for that delicate skin underneath the eyes. Have been using the sample for about 2 weeks at night and have barely made a dent, so it's safe to say a little goes a very long way.\n",
      "Line649: I wanted to like this. :( I love other belif products but this one was a flop for me. It is moisturizing and feels good on my eyes but does not help in any way. I mostly just use it now whenever I feel like my eyes need a pick me up.\n",
      "Line650: I really enjoyed this eye cream!!! I snagged some sample sizes from ipsy.  It was super hydrating.  My eyes felt incredibly soft.  It helped keep fine lines and wrinkles b from forming.  It didn't help with my dark circles though.  I've got very dark under eyes so I'm not repurchaseing a full size.\n",
      "Line651: Buyer beware! You may develop allergies to this product. I do not typically have sensitive skin. I used this eye bomb for a few weeks with no ill (and no noticeably positive beyond moisturizing) effects. However, this morning I woke up with both eyes swollen nearly shut after applying it last night. After taking allergy meds, things are slowly improving, but both eyelids (and under-eye areas) are still swollen, red, itchy, and sore.\n",
      "Line652: My favorite under eye cream. It's hydrating and feels good. This will hydrate the heck out of my dry under eyes. It absorbs quickly so you can wear it under makeup. It lasts a long time too as you only need a little bit.\n",
      "Line653: It's one of the amazing hydrating gels ever it contain ns hydraulic acid which is the best for you skin for hydration it's the best to use using this is a bit pricey but gonna buy second coz it's lightweight formula perfect for oily skin and combination as well dry skin people can also use\n",
      "Line654: Not really sure that this has really done anything for me. I think it has given milia so unfortunately I won't be repurchasing.\n",
      "Line655: I received a sample size of [product:belif-moisturizing-eye-bomb] in my Ipsy bag, and I have to say I love it.￼ I wear contacts daily and as a result, the skin around my eyes is sensitive and tired. This moisturizer felt cool and soothing.  I imagine it would feel even better applied cold. I have tried a lot of eye creams and been disappointed. This is one I will definitely purchase and continue using.￼\n",
      "Line656: This eye cream is great for sensitive skin.  As it gets colder and drier in NYC, I rely on this product to keep my eye area moisturized and soft.\n",
      "Line657: This eye cream is okay. It’s really moisturizing but it doesn’t change anything visibly. I got it as a sample and I used it up but I definitely wouldn’t purchase this for the price that it is.\n",
      "Line658: My favorite eye cream. I use this at night and my Banana Bright Eye Crème in the morning. Don’t really feel the need for a brightening effect at night so I focus on hydration which this product gives me tons of. It’s so silky and glides on beautifully. What fine lines? Dark circles where?\n",
      "Line659: Very thick product so I recommend using it as your nighttime eye cream. Overall very pleased with the product. I used it before bed and the next morning (I usually don't wear other products so if I apply it early enough in my routine it will have absorbed into my skin mostly before leaving).\n",
      "Line660: Love this eye cream is super smooth and works great. Packaging is cute. I really recommend this and will buy again.\n",
      "Line661: I liked this product, for its freshness, its appearance of whipped cream and lemon, very light and easy to apply. It is quickly absorbed by the delicate skin. Instantly refreshes and keeps moisturizing the pockets and fine lines for a long time. Soften and smooth fine lines. I have very sensitive eyes in general, so I use his products with apprehension. I have not reacted. To be used regularly before putting on makeup or in the evening before bedtime, no problem! I had a sample bought with the luxebox if topbox, but it's probably a Product that I Will renew!\n",
      "Line662: Totally reduced the spots under my eyes ANDDDDD minimized my pores! Very light weight and absorbs quickly.\n",
      "Line663: Just buy the moisturizing bomb and apply it underneath your eyes. It is more moisturizing, has alcohol further down on the ingredient list, and is cheaper when you look at price per an ounce. You can thank me later.\n",
      "Line664: This eye bomb is amazing!! Has a thin gel like texture that melts into the under eye area with a cooling effect. Definitely helps reduce puffiness in the under eye area;) definitely recommend this product!!\n",
      "Line665: I am 35 now and just recently started noticing in photos that I am seeing a few fine lines and wrinkles so I was excited to receive a mini travel size of this. I just started using it this week but so far it's really nice. Has a really nice texture that absorbs nicely into your skin, not greasy or anything and a tiny little dab is all you need so it's going to go a long ways. I'm loving it so far.  Update October 29-19: I've recently been dealing with an issue of a contact dermatitis (allergic reaction) to a chemical that I somehow spread from my body to my face and it showed up in the form of really bad eczema around my eyes, mainly my right eye. I havnt been able to put anything on my face for several weeks now because of it. Except for coconut oil this past week and now this stuff over the past 2 or 3 days. It is now about 60 to 65% better and seems to be improving a little bit each day. I am pretty sure this stuff is helping to heal it so I am going to continue using it.\n",
      "Line666: I purchased this 5ml from a lady to try it out I bought two of them immediately I saw results under my eyes were moisturized and not as sunken in No allergic reactions I am a true believer in this eye product price is on the money it is definitely a great new product worth the try\n",
      "Line667: Love this product!!! Cooling effect,  reduced puffiness and circles for a day. Nice scent(natural), maybe some essential oils present?. Belif is super natural and I 😍 that.  I love all Korean Beauty products and this does not disappoint-I will purchase in the future!!!\n",
      "Line668: Super hydrating and non- irritating. I didn’t notice if it helped with wrinkles, but my eyes were definitely less dry and the skin felt more elastic.\n",
      "Line669: belif moisturizing eye bomb  is very light, but incredibly moisturizer. I had it in sample size.  My eyes was bright, moist, relaxed. love the smell also, very refreshing !! 💙\n",
      "Line670: This smart little tub was in my Ipsy bag last month. Finally!  An product that truly nourishes the skin under my eyes. My eyes literally sucked up the product leaving no residue or tacliness a minute or two later. I really like the scant smell of lavender. I did not have any type of allergic reaction nor did this eye balm create problems with my concealer/foundation. I am so pleasantly surprised with this product. The search is over.\n",
      "Line671: My all time FAVORITE eye cream. It is a little more costly than something found at a local drugstore but well worth it. My biggest issue is it’s not accessible near me. I have to order online or drive an hour south to get it. I just can’t always do that and have had to try others. None compare to this so far. ❤️❤️❤️\n",
      "Line672: Also received this in an Ipsy bag! Sample was super small but has lasted! Really enjoy this eye cream\n",
      "Line673: This product does exactly what it says it does, moisturize! It’s very hydrating and you can feel like right away! It’s not great for under eye bags/ dark circles. The price is very reasonable for the amount of product you get, esp compared to other brands!\n",
      "Line674: Very moisturizing. Light and thin but powerful. Nice scent. Like to store in fridge.\n",
      "Line675: I've tried other eye creams that worked okay but left room for improvement. I absolutely love this eye balm! Not only does it hydrate well it also reduces fine lines as well as crepe! It has a light pleasant scent that isn't too overpowering. This cream is my new go to eye cream! I highly recommend it for more mature skin. I also suffer from dry skin and eczema and I've had no problems whatsoever with allergies!\n",
      "Line676: This stuff is absolutely amazing. I love how a little goes a long way, and that it has a good amount of the product though. I'm not entirely positive about the price though. It is a bit of a huge splurge for me. It depends on how long it lasts and if I continue to see results throughout all the seasons. That being said, for now, I'm in love with it. Maybe I'll come back in the future and update my review. P.S. I have dark circles genetically. I always look tired, even after I get a great night's of rest. But giving it the moisture it needs helps with de-puffing it and it doesn't burn my eyes. Not that I put it close to my eyeball, but I have really sensitive skin where as a lot of eye creams tend to burn my eyes. This stuff has been nice so far. Refreshing.\n",
      "Line677: Okay this stuff is good. Now, I didnt notice any great improvement of my under eye circles or the wrinkles around my eyes. But it does moisturize beautifully! I can also say that I had no issues when wearing it underneath my makeup, no greasiness or excess oils.\n",
      "Line678: I haven’t been using this long but I love the formula of this product. It makes my eyes feel so moisturized and healthy looking.\n",
      "Line679: This under eye cream is very moisturizing. It doesn't help much with dark circles or puffiness but it will keep the delicate skin under your eyes very moisturized and refreshed.\n",
      "Line680: My holy grail eye cream! I have sensitive skin with an even more sensitive under eye area so a lot of eye creams are too harsh or scented for my under eyes. This eye cream however is delicate while being intensely moisturizing. It’s wears great under makeup as well!\n",
      "Line681: I rarely give an eye cream five stars, so this might be my new Holy Grail! I got a small tub of this in my August 2019 Ipsy bag. I apply it at night and it hydrates so well I don't NEED any the next morning. I also used it all over my face one night when I felt dehydrated and thought my skin was looking a little rough. Although my face didn't wake up looking like my eyes do, I still got a really nice, ungreasy moisture. This is definitely worth it for all skin types!!\n",
      "Line682: This eye cream is everything. I've never had such a light weight water cream feel so amazingly hydrating. As soon as you put it on your eyes feel sooo good, like your skin just drank an ice cold glass of water. It's a very refreshing feeling. I like this cream for both day and night. Also it does keep your eye area hydrated for 26 hours, i love the fact that even though it lasts so long it never feels oily or greasy. Great product. A little goes a VERY long way so use sparingly.\n",
      "Line683: I just started using this 2 weeks ago. It kinda smells like there some type of menthol. Is very hydrating and you don’t need much at all.\n",
      "Line684: I received this in my Ipsy bag this month and I will definitely be buying the full-size product as I am almost finished this one!  I use it every morning in my skincare routine before applying my makeup for the day.  It really delivers a ton of hydration to my under eye area and as a result, I find my concealer to go on a lot nicer and it seems to work better.   Without makeup on, I have noticed a difference in the look of fine lines and texture in my undereye area. I am very pleased with this cream.  It does have a scent (I like the fresh scent) so be aware of that....although the scent does not linger at all and did not affect my super sensitive eyes.\n",
      "Line685: I have been using this product for the past few months and am not disappointed at all. It is a lightweight gel with a super smooth application. It definitely hydrates like no other and makes my eye area look like I’ve had a sufficient amount of sleep when I am truly running on less than six. With other eye creams, I would only apply them at night because they were too heavy or thick to wear during the day. I am glad that I found this product because I’ve actually switched my routine, so that I apply this in the morning and it works beautifully with my skin care and make up routine. A little bit of product goes along way, it lasts a good amount of time.\n",
      "Line686: I got a sample of this in my Ipsy bag and it is an amazing eye cream! I am just starting to add eye creams to my daily routine and I absolutely love this one! Even though I got a small size it will last me forever because you only need a very small amount. It is a really good eye cream and I definitely recommend!\n",
      "Line687: I love this stuff! Plain and simple. I like this eye cream a lot because the product doesn’t feel weird after awhile under the eye.\n",
      "Line688: While I can not vouch for the long term affects, when I use this consistently I see a serious difference in the lines under my eyes. Eye creams that actually show results are hard to come by, and this eye cream is the best I have ever tried. Very hydrating and soft on sensitive skin\n",
      "Line689: I have been wanting to try this eye cream for so long, and I’m glad I finally got the opportunity! It has a nice consistency—not too thick, but you can tell it’s there. I use it exclusively at night. Honestly, I don’t know if it is doing anything for my skin that my current moisturizer wasn’t already. I might not have dry enough under eyes to notice a huge difference, it is soothing, smells clean, and I’m happy to have it!\n",
      "Line690: This product definitely gets the job done, I got a sample size in my ipsy bag an just had to get the full size! Super hydrating. Most definitely over exceeded my expectations\n",
      "Line691: Love this eye cream! So hydrating. Feels like velvet on; the texture is amazing. Absorbs quickly and does not feel sticky at all. I’ve have a few mini samples of this and it has lasted such a long time; a little goes a long way. Will absolutely purchase a full size container next.\n",
      "Line692: Love this eye cream, absorbs nice and keeps delicate under eye area moisturized nicely.\n",
      "Line693: I received a sample of this in my ipsy bag this month, I really enjoy it so far! It has a light and delicate smell and the texture is nice and buttery. So far I’m loving it!\n",
      "Line694: This is an amazing eye cream. I love Belif and the moisturizing eye cream is amazing! The texture is lightweight yet thick. it has scent but does not irate my eye area at all. Just leave my eye area moisture and after about 14 days I could see the fine lines soften and after a month the lines were gone!\n",
      "Line695: This is my go to eye cream! I’ve been using it for some time now and I love it! It feels amazing after I apply because it leaves a cooling effect. I also noticed my dark circles getting lighter within 2/3 weeks after adding it into my daily skincare routine! I highly recommend this eye cream!\n",
      "Line696: This is my current every-day eye cream!  It's very hydrating, but its gel-like consistency doesn't make it feel heavy at all.  It depuffs my eyebags and doesn't have a fragrance scent (which is great for sensitive eyes).  It doesn't do much with brightening, but brightening was not one of its marketed benefits, so I don't hold it against the product.  Overall, it's a great eye cream that hydrates and moisturizes.  I'm currently half-way through my 1st jar, and I'll repurchase once I finish this one!\n",
      "Line697: Absolutely love this moisturizing eye bomb. It made some difference under my eyes like for real. Hop on this y’all, it’s the best out there! Been using this for quite some time now and it is Henny Approved ✔️\n",
      "Line698: I liked it not love it. I bought a mini set from belif. It felt okay on the skin but the products was so small that i couldn’t had a good amount of time to see the difference from other eye cream\n",
      "Line699: If you need an intensely hydrating eye cream this is for you. The hydrating creme contains tiger grass to soothe the skin and comfrey leaf to smooth. This eye cream is best suited for those with dry or dehydrated skin around the eye area. For those with oilier skin, this eye cream might slide or melt off the face.\n",
      "Line700: I loved this eye cream. My skin is very dry in certain spots and this was very hydrating under my eyes. The scent was light. I can definitely see myself using this for a long time and will repurchase when I run out.\n",
      "Line701: This stuff is magic.  It smooths and brightens.   I have no puff with thos stuff.  Dark circles are gone, too.\n",
      "Line702: There are a billion eye products out there.  I can’t tell that this one is any better than the others, but I like it\n",
      "Line703: It’s your average eye cream. It’s very very moisturizing. I don’t remember noticing a scent which is nice. It’s kind of pricey and I don’t remember ever seeing this anywhere other than Sephora so that sucks.\n",
      "Line704: This is the best eye cream ever. It is so moisturizing. It soaks right in and you can even wear it under makeup. This is my holy grail!\n",
      "Line705: I liked this eye cream for the moisture it sealed in and the way it provided a barrier for the delicate skin around my eyes. It was a nice product that slightly lightened my dark circles. I only wish it didn’t ball up when going over it a few minutes later. It could have sunk into my skin better.\n",
      "Line706: This is a great eye cream! Very cooling under the eyes. I apply this at night and it works amazing! Definitely worth the money. It’s very gentle under the eyes! Recommend to anyone looking for an eye cream!\n",
      "Line707: After my first use, I thought this eye cream was too thick and rich. I was super paranoid about getting milia, so I wanted to stay away from anything that was too emollient for my eyes. However, after a few more uses (only at night), I am totally in love with this product. Even though it felt super rich in the beginning, it gets absorbed very quickly, leaving the area around my eyes soft and supple. I also like to mix a tiny bit of it with my concealer and it just smooths out my concealer perfectly. It adds moisture, feels refreshing, and I definitely recommend it.\n",
      "Line708: This eye creme does nothing but moisturize. It’s neither good or bad. It’s whatever. Would not purchase as I’m more focused on anti aging\n",
      "Line709: This eye cream feels AHHMAZING!!! Its cool, clean, and very moisturizing. I love this brand, especially in the summertime, but their eye cream I would use year round. With all the hydraunic (sp) acid, it plumps up the skin around my eyes, especially the fine lines and is very soothing.\n",
      "Line710: Wow this eye cream is absolutely amazing!!!! My under eyes are particularly dry and concealer always ends up looking cakey and creasy after a couple hours. Not with this!!! My under eyes are so smooth and hydrated. A little bit goes a VERY LONG WAY. This is a pretty big tub for only $48 and absolutely worth it. I’m using it morning and night for about a week and barely put a dent in it.\n",
      "Line711: Oh my goodness!!!!! I wish I could give this product ten stars !!!!! It is the best most hydrating eye cream I have ever used and I spend hundreds of dollars on skincare monthly to try to find the perfect products. After finding this I have not tried anything else for eye creams cause this is the ultimate I have ever used. My favorite. I get really dry skin around my eyes so this is perfect for the hydration of my eyes!!!!! Highly highly highly recommend\n",
      "Line712: Recently I’ve been getting skin peeling under my eyes and this really helps. Not only does it moisturise it also brightens and I instantly look more awake after I use it. It is quite expensive but it’s the only eye cream that’s been working for me long term recently. I previously reviewed the Simple® Soothing Eye Balm which was good but it doesn’t even compare to this one. #essential\n",
      "Line713: Lots of moisture and no irritation on my sensitive skin. I only use it at night as it takes a while to soak in and will crease under concealer.\n",
      "Line714: This a hydrating lightweight eye cream. It’s very gentle. It’s mainly hydrating. It’s doesn’t help with dark circles or wrinkles. If that’s what you need I would suggest looking somewhere else.\n",
      "Line715: This product does, as it claims, hydrate your under eyes. It does not have anti-aging properties, it does not plump up the wrinkles. I do like this for those days I know I need extra coverage for those pesky dark circles that are darker on those sleepless nights. This helps make the full coverage concealers not cake or crease as usual.\n",
      "Line716: Very good moisturizer for under eyes . I need to try the moisturizer and firming one since I’m getting old and need all the extra help I can get. But if you just in need for dry under eyes this is a good one and a jar will last you forever\n",
      "Line717: This works for about 2 hours then it wears off. I do like it, but can’t keep putting it on every 2 hours! I f you need a quick fix this is the product to use!\n",
      "Line718: For someone with dry under-eyes like me, this eye cream unfortunately did not work for me. It's a great product underneath concealer but to use this as a treatment.. I'll pass. I ended up returning this eye-cream because it was not hydrating enough for me.\n",
      "Line719: Love love love this eye cream extremely moisturizing and hydrating. Easy gel-like texture sinks and quickly. works really really well in dry climates which is hard to find\n",
      "Line720: This is your basic hydrating eye cream. It does the job of delivering moisture to the eye area, and it did not irritate my eyes at all. I am in my mid-20’s and do not have wrinkles around the eye area yet, so this eye cream is perfect for me as a preventative measure by keeping the skin moisturized. I also love that all the Belif products are quite affordable for their premium products, and this eye cream jar is pretty large for the price you pay (compared to other eye creams out there).\n",
      "Line721: Really hydrating. I really like the lemongrass scent it has and I bought this product in mini size with a kit.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb  I myself haven't got problems with my under eye area, but I like to keep is moisturized every night... With this cream my under eyes were still wet from the previous application.\n",
      "Line722: so insanely hydrating and I love it. I have super dry undereyes & this has helped them so much. I love how it feels and my undereyes always feel so much better with it on. leaves a little bit of a sticky residue for a while if you do it in the am but honestly worth it.\n",
      "Line723: I love this product! This is very lightweight, refreshing eye cream floods fine lines. makes skin perfect for flawless makeup application. This cooling texture instantly bursts with hydration and blends seamlessly, keeping the eye area supple and hydrated while prepping it for a smooth crease-free makeup application.\n",
      "Line724: By now I’ve probably used at least 5 deluxe samples of this and several foil samples. Any chance I get to redeem my Sephora points to get this, I do it. I’ve bought a belif set that came with a water gel, two moisturizers and this eye cream. It’s the best! My favorite! I will definitely buy a full size in the future, I just really need to use up all my other eye creams to justify a purchase, story of my life ha!\n",
      "Line725: My under eye concerns are almost unsolvable, I have very dark circles that are thankfully not puffy. So this product unfortunately hasn't helped my under eyes brighten in any way but instead has kept the area very moisturized and healthy which I appreciate.\n",
      "Line726: God I love this eye cream! It goes on so easily and soaks in well. Very gentle around the eyes and is even great for forehead lines! Yes! I use this on my forehead and between the brow instead of my regular moisturizer because it’s super hydrating and doesn’t pill! I like to apply it under my Belif water sleeping mask!\n",
      "Line727: Absolutely amazing! It gives my eyes a burst of hydration in the morning and keeps me looking great all day.\n",
      "Line728: Amazing for those who want some deep hydration to the eye area. Interesting fact- the eye area is the most delicate area on the face and has the hardest time retaining hydration! With continual use, this product will be sure to make a change in your skin care routine.\n",
      "Line729: I got this as a sample from influensters for free and enjoyed enjoyed this guy. The cream wasn’t really thick, but the right water to cream ratio. It spreader against the skin very easy and leave it smooth. It definitely brightened up under the eye a bit as well.\n",
      "Line730: It's really nice and feels great but haven't noticed much of a difference and it feels that sometimes it is a little thick for under the eyes.\n",
      "Line731: This is a very creamy eye moisturizer. Though I normally like the gel type formulas, this one packed a moisture punch that won me over.  It leaves my skin smooth and with visible less fine lines. And in the winter it’s my go to for dryness that I deal with in the harsh wind.  It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a heavy residue feeling which I love!\n",
      "Line732: Meilleur crème contour des yeux sur le marché, hydrate en profondeur. Mais n’agit pas sur les cernes.\n",
      "Line733: Love it. Got a full size to review and I’m still using it. It smells good, and last longer because of the amount for the price.\n",
      "Line734: The Belif Eye Bomb is a decent eye cream. It's nothing to write home about, but it's not bad by any means. It's just ok. Not something I would recommend or steer someone away from. Just right down the middle mediocre.\n",
      "Line735: This is one of my current favorites. It’s deeply hydrating and makes my eyes feel fresh and ready for the day. It’s also thick enough wear at night but still layers well under makeup in the day.\n",
      "Line736: I thought this product was okay. I wish it moisturized more. Although the product has a good price, I wish I would have tried something else. I feel like there are better products out there on the market. Hopefully they can come out with an advanced formula in the future.\n",
      "Line737: The best eye cream. hands down. I have heard a lot of people complain about this stinging the eyes - you're not supposed to put it in your eyes (just around, I promise you it won't stay in one spot and your entire eye area will get the moisture it needs without you putting it IN your eye)\n",
      "Line738: A very good moisturizing formula. Is pretty thick for an eye cream but is easily absorbed, which i think is a very important feature for an eye cream. Leaves skin nicely moisturized and feeling soft. A little goes a veey long way. So even though it is a little pricey you will have ot for a long time.\n",
      "Line739: I've been using this for a few weeks and it's really not doing anything for the fine lines around my eyes. Disappointed.\n",
      "Line740: I am in love with this eye cream. I had tried other Belif products in the past, but wasn’t impressed. This one blew me away. It’s insanely hydrating which is a must on my dry under eyes. My concealer goes on so much better when I’ve used this beforehand.\n",
      "Line741: I was so excited to try a belif product, and I wanted to love the Moisturizing Eye Bomb. The packaging was lovely, keeping with belif's standards. The texture was also lovely and felt cooling on the eyes. I hate that this product stung my eyes.\n",
      "Line742: Seems to be hydrating but might not be enough every time I use this and put concealer on my concealer looks more dry. I don’t know if it just doesn’t sit nice under makeup or my other eye cream is better.\n",
      "Line743: I honestly am super disappointed in this product. I have heard very good things about belif as a brand and was ecstatic to receive the voxbox for this. I have drier under eyes so I was hoping this would combat that. BUT it does NOTHING. I have tried this for a while and have seen zero results. It does not even seep into the skin a little. It sits on top of your skin and in the matter of minutes balls up and easily wipes away.\n",
      "Line744: The belief Moisturizing Eye Bomb truly is the bomb! When my eye lids are feeling dry I reach for this because it hydrates them in seconds and smooths away lines and wrinkles. You will see results in just 7 days. it is gel consistency but sinks into the skin in seconds. I have this in the full size and travel size because I don't want to be with out it especially right now in the winter.\n",
      "Line745: This is a great eye cream to apply moisture to the under eyes. It’s a gel-consistency and doesn’t act greasy under make-up! I have extremely dry under eyes and this just didn’t pack enough punch to be my stand-alone cream. I don’t have anything negative to say, just wasn’t the best!\n",
      "Line746: Best eye cream ever .  Seems like a small container but i have used the same small bottle for 6 months !  For the price and the fact that this stuff is just amazing , how could you not try it !\n",
      "Line747: This is my discovery from Ipsy. This product became must have for mee. After using this eye cream diseepear my problem about under eye cyrcle and coloring. It’s good moisturizer,you feel good result soon after strart using.\n",
      "Line748: Very moisturizing, and cooling. Helps with wrinkles, and dryness. First time user. I actually got a sample of it. I believe it is a little pricey. I think it’s gentle. On the price yes, it could improve.\n",
      "Line749: I'm a true fan of Korean Beauty and have purchased other items from this brand. The cream is lightweight & can be used in the morning under make-up. It obsorbs quickly and doesn't have a any fragrance that may irritate the eyes.\n",
      "Line750: Extremely moisturizing eye cream. It also smells lovely. My makeup does not melt off throughout the day when I use this in the morning. I got this as a sample and may have to purchase a full size. A little goes a long way.\n",
      "Line751: This stuff truly makes my eyes look brighter and stiffer!! I use this every night before bed. It smells good, and really does work. It also lasts a very long time - a little goes a long way.  I am glad that I got to try this because I will never use another eye cream again.\n",
      "Line752: I swear by this! After using this my under eyes are so smooth and makeup goes on perfectly with no creasing. It really hydrates my under eyes and helps me look awake after late nights. I definitely recommend it!\n",
      "Line753: This is is great rapid moisturizing for the eyes. No you dont see that much of a difference immediately but it really gives a good moisturization like nothing else.\n",
      "Line754: Didn’t see a huge improvement in dark circles or puffiness. Was very moisturizing. Was not harsh at all on my skin.  First time user of this product.  Not very effective.\n",
      "Line755: I love this eye cream. It’s very hydrating and sits well under my makeup. For an eye cream at Sephora the price is definitely more reasonable.\n",
      "Line756: This eye cream is so bomb! I use it day and night and it moisturizes better than any eye cream I've ever used. It's super hydrating without being greasy. It absorbs quickly and doesn't run off into the eyes. Works beautifully under makeup and it's great for layering over serums. The tiniest bit goes a long way. I highly recommend this is you've been looking for a product that addresses dryness, tightness, cracking or early signs of aging around the eyes.\n",
      "Line757: Very watery. I used it everyday. I didn’t see much of a difference I was hoping that it would have a little bit of a creamier consistency\n",
      "Line758: Love this eye cream. Not very fragranced which is refreshing. Also a great value for the amount of product you get!!\n",
      "Line759: This cream is absolutely amazing. I received it as 100 point park at Sephora. But, when I finish this I will definitely buy the full-size. It is very hydrating for your under eyes, which makes it great for any skin type and every age. I love how it hydrate your skin very quickly, and leaves no weird residue behind. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!\n",
      "Line760: This really does moisturizer your eyes. It lasts all day, so your eyes don’t feel dry at all. It makes my concealer go on pretty well.\n",
      "Line761: This is such a wonderful product. My undereyes throughout day get a really drying feeling especially in the winter this just gives me a nice pick me up and makes my undereyes feel so great. I recommend putting this in the refrigerator so when you apply it, the product has a cooling or cool sensation to it.\n",
      "Line762: This is the best eye cream i have ever used. I have really sensitive skin and allergies to alot. This makes my under eye cosmetic products apply so much better. It doesn't move into my eyes either like some eye products. Also a plus it doesn't have a nasty smell.\n",
      "Line763: This cream is like a thicker version of the True Cream Aqua Bomb, which is a really solid moisturizer. This version is nice, but unfortunately, I don’t feel like it does very much. It is light, absorbs well, and doesn’t leave a residue, but the actives leave much to be desired. I prefer eye creams with hyaluronic acid or caffeine—things that make a visible difference. This will moisturize, but not much else.\n",
      "Line764: I don’t sleep a lot on account of I’m a mom, wife, supervisor, sister, friend, women. So I like to take my eye bomb and pat that sucker under my eye and feel like I’m not a hot mess. It works. My eyes feel hydrated, cool and thanks to genetics and this cream I’m not a hot baggy eyed mess. It’s a bit expensive but it’s a lot and lasts awhile so it’s worth it.\n",
      "Line765: This is one of my favorite eye products, so I keep it by my bedside at all times. I love how it’s light and airy, while delivering moisture and hydration for days. It has a nice cooling effect, and does not feel heavy like some eye creams do\n",
      "Line766: Great product!! I have extremely dry skin so i need hydration big time under my eyes!! This eye bomb works wonders for me it's extremely hydrating it sinks into the skin quickly and leaves your under eyes super soft!! Definitely recommend!!!\n",
      "Line767: The best eye cream EVER!! I tried a looot of eyecreams from several brands & none of them really did something to my dry under eyes. Until a friend of mine suggested to try this belief one & okuurrr neber looked back! It has a really unique formulla that sincks into the sensitive eye area and leaves it fresh & hydrated &plump in love! Wil purshase it again for sure!❤🙆\n",
      "Line768: I love this eye cream! It’s the only one I’ve repurchased after running out of it as I normally like to try new products as often as possible. Very fast absorbed, doesn’t have a scent or color, and I notice my under eye area very moisturized and plump. I do have dry skin so moistuziration is something I’m constantly seeking for. I’d however, prefer if this was an air tight pump or a squeeze tube.\n",
      "Line769: Belif is one of my favorite brands. I received this in my sephora play box and was hooked. I use this every morning and every night. I have oily skin and this doesn't make me to oily and is very moisturizing. A little goes a long way so it's worth the price. I have repurchased this twice and don't see me using anything else in the near future\n",
      "Line770: I love this eye cream at night. I like to keep it in the fridge so that it's cool when I apply it. Helps plump up and moisturize overnight\n",
      "Line771: A small travel size product but you have to use it in such small amounts and it stays longer. I just dab a little near my eye. The puffiness and the dryness is surely reduced. It reduces wrinkles. Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "Line772: This product, let me tell you is amazing!!! I absolutely love all of Belif’s products. I have sensitive skin, and their products work great and have never broken me out. I have fine lines under my eyes that get really dry at times. Once I started using this moisturizing eye bomb, the dryness started going away. It’s a staple in my daily skin care routine and HIGHLY RECOMMEND Belif’s products.\n",
      "Line773: Instantaneous hydration for the eye area .. this cream gives me super charm .. it is excellent for the eye area that is super senciblebelif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line774: Eye moisturizer prevents wrinkles and soft and very pleasant for the area under the eyes and opens the black area under the eyes💜\n",
      "Line775: Love this stuff, super hydrating but doesn’t make your skin greasy! The product is thick and very gentle on the skin. One bottle of this stuff lasts forever!\n",
      "Line776: This is one of my favorite eye moisturizers! It’s super hydrating and light in texture . I use it in the morning and night depending on my routine. I recommend this for anyone! It doesn’t make your skin oily either which is great\n",
      "Line777: MUST HAVE PRODUCT!!! Belif moisturizing eye bomb is one of my favorite eye products ever! The consistency is great and is very moisturizing. I use this product twice a day to make sure I reap all the benefits. The eye area is the first to age, so it is an area that needs extra care. It absorbs really well and smells amazing. My number ONE!!\n",
      "Line778: I love this eye bomb . When you apply this product it feels nice and cool. It keeps my under eye looking fresh and feeling moisturized.\n",
      "Line779: I love it! I have combination skin and this moisturizes my dry places without turning my oily places into an oily mess. Tried a sample size first, loved it so bought this larger size. A little goes a long way each night. Using around eyes & forehead wrinkles. Skin feels so hydrated but not oily!\n",
      "Line780: Nice, light, hydrating eye moisturer. A little goes along way. I use this morning and night. The skin around my eyes always looks soft, not dry and crepey. I had no issues with wearing this under makeup either.\n",
      "Line781: I use this eye cream every single night. Ever since the first time I tried this I have been absolutely in love with it and how super moisturizing it is! It sinks into my skin so well but doesn’t leave me feeling greasy afterwards.\n",
      "Line782: I absolutely love this company. I have sensitive skin, oily in the t-zones, have bags and dark circles under eyes. This product is light, doesn’t bother my eyes or skin. A lil pricey but worth it. This has definitely changed my skin care regime.\n",
      "Line783: I have combination skin and this moisturizes my dry places without turning my oily places into an oily mess. Tried a sample size first, loved it so bought this larger size. A little goes a long way each night. Using around eyes & forehead wrinkles. Skin feels so hydrated but not oily!\n",
      "Line784: I absolutely love this product. I use it every night as well as a moisturizer during the day. It keeps my under eye area hydrated. It’s very light and refreshing. It works very well with makeup and it just relaxes my skin during the night.\n",
      "Line785: If u have problems with dry under eyes and with ur concealer creasing on u try this under eye cream it works wonders go get a sample and give it a go, u won’t regret it\n",
      "Line786: Belif moisturizing eye bomb is the bomb!!!! I got this in one of my Sephora Play bags. I love it & use it about every night on my eyes. I do see a big difference in the skin around my eyes. I notice when I do my eye makeup. It's easier to apply on my lids. I'm 51 yrs old now, my skin is just starting to getting looser on my eyes and I have a little bit of wrinkles at the corners . so I want to stay ahead of it.\n",
      "Line787: I got a sample size of this eye cream in an Ipsy bag and I immediately fell in love. I’ve reached that age wear I’m starting to get fine lines under my eyes and I’ve seen a considerable improvement in them since I started using this.\n",
      "Line788: Amazing eye cream perfect to wear under your concealer! After I run off my sample (courtesy of influenster) I bought it online, I carry it with me all the time and reapply it during the day to refresh my makeup!\n",
      "Line789: I did not like this product at all. I got for free in a Sephora Playbox so I wanted to try it. The first day I tried it it left little whiteheads all under my eye where I had applied it. I threw out the product that same day.\n",
      "Line790: Love this eye balm, lightweight and creamy, it feels amazing around the eyes. I wish it had more anti aging components to it though\n",
      "Line791: The smell is a little too perfumey for me but it’s a wonderful eye cream. I’ve wanted to try Belif products for a while and while I was a little disappointed with some, this one was pretty great. I probably will not purchase again but I will definitely wait to buy another eye cream until I use this one all up!\n",
      "Line792: Very hydrating and absorbs quickly! The size is very generous. Belief products are always high quality.\n",
      "Line793: I got a sample of this and I’ve fallen in love! It has hydrated my under eyes more than any other under eye moisturizer ever has! After just a week of using this, I have noticed a huge difference in my under eyes! I use it morning and night. In the morning I do put this on, let it set for a few minutes and then add my Olehendricksen banana eye cream on top and the bags almost disappear! Once the sample runs out I’ll be running to Sephora to grab the full size!\n",
      "Line794: I received a sample of this in the Aqualand Playset and I absolutely loved it! It delivered on all of its claims and I loved it as much as I love the Moisturizing Bomb. I wish it came in a pump packaging so that the ingredients remained stable for longer, but it’s an effective eye cream worth the money regardless!\n",
      "Line795: I have been using this for about a month now and I can really tell a difference. This keeps my eye area very hydrated. I also notice that my eyes aren't as puffy as they normally are not do I have dark circles anymore. This just makes my eyes look a thousand times better. Yes it's on the pricier side, but it's totally worth it!\n",
      "Line796: I love this product. It’s my favorite eye cream. It really moisturizes the skin around my eyes and makes my fine lines look better. I would definitely recommend\n",
      "Line797: Keeps skin nice and hydrated. I don’t see any fine lines around my eyes anymore. Moisture is key to prevent dry/wrinkle skin\n",
      "Line798: Received it from the Sephora beauty box I believe and had no expectations but it feels refreshing,  doesn't sting,  and I would say around my eyes look bright and tight. Not sunken,  no dark circles.  I don't know how much it costs but if I find it affordable,  I would definitely buy again.\n",
      "Line799: I got a sample of this and fell in love.  The only thing that I don’t like about it is the price tag.  It is very hydrating.  If it goes on sale I would purchase it.\n",
      "Line800: This eye cream is highly moisturizing and creamy. It replenishes my under eye area, leaving it feeling new and younger ( I’m 24, but prevention is key!). I bought mine from Sephora, but I’m sure you can find it elsewhere. I recommend it!\n",
      "Line801: My boyfriend and I love this product It is awesome. The price is a little bit expensive but it is worth it.\n",
      "Line802: I received this as a sample size in my Ipsy bag and I have to say I love it. It’s lightweight and moisturizing and leaves the eyes feeling refreshed and awake. I would purchase on my own money when I’m done with the sample size. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line803: This was okay it does what it claims. It hydrates my eye area but that’s it. I need more from an eye moisturizer, more benefits then just hydration. If that’s all your looking for in an eye cream (gel) you’ll love it.\n",
      "Line804: I love this product! I have a small sample pot, from etsy, and I use it religiously now. It looks like a small product that's not worth it, but the smallest little dab can be used on both of my eyes, so it really does last awhile. It feels really soothing to put on, and I can immediately feel how hydrating it is on my sore and puffy eyes after a long day. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Line805: While I usually sing the praises of this brand, this kinda just works. It’s nice and light, works well under makeup and is somewhat hydrating. It’s not outstanding but it’s nice. Not hydrating enough for me for nighttime use.\n",
      "Line806: This is one of the best eye moisturizers I’ve ever used! It makes eye skin so soft and it’s super light on your skin. It spreads so much even if you only use a little bit. I would recommend this if you need a good eye cream\n",
      "Line807: Oh my god this is my favorite eye cream right now. It’s like super moisturizing y’all! It’s not harsh at all. It’s gentle and light weight. I mean it is super super expensive in my opinion. It’s almost 50$ but I love it so much and I’ll have to buy again.\n",
      "Line808: LOVE THIS EYE CREAM! It’s cooling and moisturizing while still feeling light. Blends in very well, and sits perfectly under makeup. Not to mention, I LOVE the packaging, the blue looks gorgeous on my shelf.\n",
      "Line809: I absolutely love the belif products they work so well to hydrate and refresh your skin and that exactly what this cream does for you under eye. This is so amazing it hydrates your under eye area and leaves it soft and moist.\n",
      "Line810: The eye cream is spiked with comfrey leaf and pennywort herb. The cooling effect helps with puffiness. It is refreshing on the eyes and it absorbs really easily.\n",
      "Line811: Hands down my favorite eye cream I have ever tried EVER my eyes are very sensitive so I’m very careful with what I put near them and this baby is safe enough for eyes and gets up close and personal with hydrating and de puffing. Day night and before makeup this is my bff for hydration\n",
      "Line812: I was introduced to Belif's Moisturizing Eye Bomb through a subscription box sample. It was, no lie, love st first feel! I have tried so many eye creams, from drugstore to high-end and this little gem is my new HG. Like legitimate holy grail, search is over, my ride or die! My concealer has never looked better. My main problem with eye area has always been dryness under the eye allowing concealer or foundation to settle in to every single fine line I could possibly have. Eye creams I had tried always left my eyes feeling sticky, tight and uncomfortable. I was definitely skeptical about trying this one out. Just the name, moisturizing eye bomb, immediately had me thinking this product would feel like the rest. Heavy, sticky and uncomfortable. Let me just say, I was WRONG. The eye bomb is never sticky, it's a very lightweight moisturizer that packs such a hydrating punch without feeling too greasy or too heavy. Before using this, my eyes always seemed dull. The delicate skin around them, so dehydrated looking. I had pretty much given up on finding a product that could do what I needed it to. No need to give up now! This moisturizer visibly pumps skin which minimized the look of all those dehydrated fine lines I had before. My concealer sits beautifully on top of it and I can't imagine my skincare routine with put this being apart of it. Ladies, if you have similar problems to what I had, do your self a favor, go pick some of this eye cream and then thank me later ;)  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line813: I absolutely love this eye cream!  It’s a little pricey, but I think it’s worth it.  A little bit goes a long way.  I put some in my fridge and with my makeup.  It gives my under eyes much needed moisture.  I will continue to by it unless I find something else to replace it. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line814: Got this in a Sephora Play box. Thought it would be great to hydrate the dry skin on my lids from scrubbing off makeup. Unfortunately the next morning my eyes were swollen shut and burned like crazy.  My eyes look bruised almost. It's super painful. I can't believe this happened from a freaking cream made for your eyes.\n",
      "Line815: Can I just say this is the most fabulous and amazing eye cream I have ever used. I have dry skin and under my eyes is no different it's always very dry and there's always lots of puffiness to and dark circles. This was recommended to me by a close friend who has similar skin not exact skin as I do but hers is very similar she does have a little bit of oil issues and I don't I'm just dry and Flaky all day long. This however is amazing I put it on the very moment it touched my skin I felt refreshed I felt revitalized I felt like a human being and not a walking chalk stick. I did start only using it at night because it's so expensive and I really really really didn't want to be burning through this product. It has done amazing things for my skin I use it in the morning and at night before bed. This is worth the investment a little bit goes a very long way this product will last you a long time you will get your money's worth.\n",
      "Line816: Really good, it gives a sensation of freshness on the skin, it is quite light and smells good. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line817: I absolutely love this eye cream!! I use it about 3 times a day, super easy to put on, I have a sample size and its lasted for 3 months now! love the way it feels on my skin, and it has literally gotten rid of my dark circles! you will not regret getting this!\n",
      "Line818: Very Moisturizing I Use It Every Morning And Night. Its Didint Irritate My Eyes Or Around Them.\n",
      "Line819: This is my favorite eye cream! I have really dry under eyes and using this helps minimize creasing when I set my under eye concealer.\n",
      "Line820: Wow. Totally in love ever since I got this in my Box Box I have used every single night and will continue to\n",
      "Line821: Super hydrating eye product. I find that if I use this at least ten minutes before I start my makeup, it helps keep my eye area from looking too dry under my concealer. Love using this at night and waking up to eyes that don't look as tired as I feel. I had a sample that I really liked. This is a bit pricey but I may look into purchasing a full size because it really is a nice moisturizer\n",
      "Line822: Pretty damn good . Worth the money . Great for eyes . Smells great . It’s a must buy for anyone with under eye concerns\n",
      "Line823: I enjoy using this eye bomb at night before bed. It has a cooling feeling and subtle natural scent. My favorite part is that this product absorbs nicely into my skin and does not leave behind any residue.\n",
      "Line824: I  love  love  love  this prodact ..my body need to strong   prodact like this my mum try it befor  😍😍❤❤❤❤ i hope to get it more and more in near feuture 😍😍😍\n",
      "Line825: Love this moisturizer! Is seriously a moisturizing bomb! Isn't oily and leaves my eyes feeling so soft even in Chicago winters. I've even used it other places like my poor winter dry nose.\n",
      "Line826: I got a little sample with my online purchase and I'm saving money to buy a full size and eventually more items in the line. It hydrates under my eyes perfectly and makes my bags less noticeable. Feels very fresh. Smells like herbs. This product truly makes me feel comfortable in my skin and I'm ugly so it's a big deal.\n",
      "Line827: This product does it’s described job- it IS moisturizing. However, that is all this product does. It doesn’t necessarily de-puff my morning eyes or have any anti-aging properties. Still a good product though.\n",
      "Line828: Hydrating, moisturizing, I love it! My first bottle has lasted me for a long time, a little goes a long way.\n",
      "Line829: I just recently started using this product. I have noticed a decrease in my puffiness and dark circles. I am definitely a fan of this product. It is very light and creamy and does well underneath my makeup\n",
      "Line830: I love this stuff, it really works great. It keeps my eye area moisturized/ hydrated and boost the elasticity.\n",
      "Line831: Recibi este producto en una caja de regalo. Me parece un buen hidratante de ojos. Buen olor. Pero un poco espeso lo que obliga a hacerlo con un poco de fuerza.\n",
      "Line832: This is a really nice eye cream. It feels very moisturizing under the eye and has this slight tingling feeling. It works good and my eyes feel refreshed when I put it on. Highly recommend to everyone.\n",
      "Line833: I like this so much I always try to get my dark cicle moisturized and this is so perfect.\n",
      "Line834: I have dry skin and sometimes my undereye gets super dry and this stuff is amazing for it. It hydrates without being to thick and goopy. Nice gel like consistency that absorbs right into the skin. I use at night and in morning before I apply makeup.\n",
      "Line835: I received this in a VoxBox and I am still using it. I'm actually getting dangerously close to finishing it and having a bit of a panic attack. And I'm a product whore, so wanting to stick with one product is a pretty big deal for me. This eye cream is more of a gel texture and sinks in quickly while leaving you feeling hydrated and a bit plumped. I found that it worked equally as well at night as under makeup in the morning. I have sensitive skin and this didn't cause any irritation or bumps around the eye delicate eye area. This has been a total life saver this winter, and it's lightweight texture promises to work just as well in our southern summers, so I am going to be keeping one of these on my vanity!\n",
      "Line836: I thoroughly enjoy using this product. I was sent this to test for Influenster and I’m really happy I was. It’s pleasant and cooling feeling when applied. It immediately hydrates and sinks in quite quickly. I would wait 10-15 minutes before applying concealer just to ensure it has completely sunk in though. When I apply it at night I wake up to really smooth, hydrated under-eyes. I’ve never thought eye creams are necessary because of using a daily/nightly moisturizer that I just bring all the way up to under my eyes but I could see myself purchasing this one when I run out of the one I was sent. The texture of this is unlike any other eye cream (or moisturizer for that matter) and it’s gel-like formula is what sets it apart from the others. I love that belif is cruelty free and doesn’t necessarily break the bank with their products. This will not get rid of fine lines or wrinkles but it does visibly hydrate and create a more wide-eye awake look.\n",
      "Line837: I was so excited to try this item and when I received it, I was so happy. However, the product didn’t live up to my expectations. The area around my eye did not feel more moisturized but rather dry. I won’t be purchasing this item in the future.\n",
      "Line838: This eye cream instantly hydrated my under eye. It very effective and brightens the under eye. It’s gentle for the under eye and a little goes along way. I received a sample and would definitely repurchase this in a full size.\n",
      "Line839: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is in my opinion a great product.  It is very moisturizing and does not have any strong fragrance to it.  I can not tell if there is a noticeable  difference with any lines or wrinkles but my skin is less dry.\n",
      "Line840: Got this in my Sephora playbox and while I love how this eye gel feels after applying BUT it makes my eyes water extremely bad!!....After a few uses passed this on to my mom who likes it and has no issues with it and it doesn’t make her eyes water.\n",
      "Line841: Thank you Sephora Play! Box for introducing me to this miracle eye cream! It is so lightweight and silky, so it’s perfect for unwinding at the end of the day under the eyes. It doesn’t have any scent and does an excellent job at moisturizing and making your eyes look refreshed and renewed in the morning. Love it!\n",
      "Line842: my circle of my eyes is very dark and when im try this product of belif moisturizing eye bomb my eyes be beautiful i can not how i describe my eyes . my eyes be very light and wonderful this product it is very awesome i wish to you also try this product good luck\n",
      "Line843: LOVE this eye cream. It’s part of my nightly ritual and it makes the skin around my eyes SO soft and moisturized! I love to use it with their regular moisturizing bomb for the whole face! Absolutely recommend this product! Also its scent-free which I love.\n",
      "Line844: This is a great eye cream that I use in the morning and at night. It is super hydrating and I love how it feels on my face! I got this for free from influenster to try out! Thank you guys!!\n",
      "Line845: One of the best moisturizers I have used on my skin. This product is very effective and gentle on my sensitive skin. I am a first time buyer and would buy it again. I recommend this.\n",
      "Line846: super thick, yet an interesting watery texture. I love how this product feels on my eyes and the intense hydration it consistently delivers. I've never used such a hydrating product before belif, and now I'm a belifer! A bit pricey, which is why I tried the deluxe sample from Sephora.\n",
      "Line847: Got this in a sub box and I’ve really enjoy the hydration it gives my eye area. I haven’t yet noticed anything else happening as far as wrinkles and what not but in all fairness I’ve only been using it for a week so I’ll give it more time and then come back and update. I will say I love this brand and am excited to keep using my sample.\n",
      "Line848: This is a great product. It is an undereye cream , but I use it on my whole face. It’s perfect in the winter for protecting delicate facial skin. The only thing I don’t love is the scent. It’s not bad, at all. It just reminds me of how wet wipes smell.\n",
      "Line849: I really like some of their other products...and this one is ‘okay’. It’s not phenomenal. I didn’t notice any significant difference. But it was gentle and it actually made for a good eye primer because of the consistency...\n",
      "Line850: This product is extremely rich, so I have been using it as a night cream. It feels a bit heavy during the day, so I have been alternating this with  Origins GinZing Refreshing Eye Cream to Brighten & Depuff On-the-Go . It works wonders if your eyes are dry, and it helps with the dark circles, too. Also because it is rich, a single drop of this product goes a long way.\n",
      "Line851: I received this in my Sephora play box today  and I'm impressed.  I will definitely buy the larger size. Fresh scent, and plump up my saggy eyes. I'm 37, this will be an everyday product.\n",
      "Line852: LOVE LOVE this!!  So moisturizing, great consistency and the smell is amazing. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line853: I been using this for 2 months now, I don’t really see much of a difference. I have dry under eyes  and texture I guess you can say and it doesn’t do much for me but it’s still better than no cream\n",
      "Line854: This eye cream is too heavy for me and migrated into my eye no matter how little I apply, I need something creamier that absorbs more quickly. I like this brand but I prefer the water versions to the creams.\n",
      "Line855: I love belif products. I’m already a diehard fan of the True Aqua Bomb, so I was pumped to  get the True Eye Bomb from Influenster to try for free. The Eye Bomb didn’t disappoint; theres a reason that it sells out at Sephora on a regular basis. This eye cream is silky and ultra hydrating. It keeps my eyes from having that thin, dry feeling all day long!\n",
      "Line856: The Belif moisturizing eye bomb is amazing product. I have been using it every morning and evening for almost 4 weeks. The area around eyes becomes looking healthier. It’s really diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. The texture of cream very lightweight. It absorbs instantly and leaves the skin around my eyes super hydrated. it feels so cool and refreshing on the skin.\n",
      "Line857: Im not huge on eye creams because i really don't need them. I dont get dry skin around my eyes or dark circles. Since i found thia eye cream, i realized WHY i need one. It has got rid of my crows feet almost completely and i see an improvement in my skintone around my eyes. I was not a believer but this product is a game changer!\n",
      "Line858: Absolutely LOVED LOVED THIS PRODUCT! Omg my skin felt so moisturized. I WILL be buying this and also trying other Belif products because of how much I love what this does for my face. I also loved the packaging, it sticks out so it’s something you can easily spot in your make up bin to put on!\n",
      "Line859: This eye cream is fantastic! Eye creams usually do next to nothing for my sensitive, dark, dry eyes. I sampled this eye cream and it was love at first application. The formula is a velvety, soft gel cream that absorbs quickly and deeply moisturizes without being heavy or greasy. It almost seems to instantly plump and brighten as well! Highly recommend this one!\n",
      "Line860: I absolutely love this product! This is my first time using it. It absorbs very easily and a little goes a long way. I would certainly purchase this when my Eye Cream runs out. The only thing that I don’t care for is the packaging. The container is like the size of a face cream, which is misleading when you look at it.\n",
      "Line861: Belif's 'The True Cream' Moisturizing Bomb was already a staple in my evening skin care lineup, so I was really excited to try the eye bomb. It didn't disappoint! The thick formula is intensely moisturizing but magically doesn't feel heavy or greasy; it absorbs into the skin and feels really soothing. I use it in my nighttime routine and wake up looking refreshed and hydrated. A little goes a long way, so it's a great value for the package size.\n",
      "Line862: I LOVE this moisturizer! I have very dry skin and the delicate area around the eyes is always the first to show this under concealer and foundation especially when setting it with a powder. This moisturizer has changed everything! The fine lines and creases are much less noticeable and I love the gel consistency of this formula. It’s lightweight but long lasting and is never sticky. I use this every morning and night and my eyes have never looked better!\n",
      "Line863: It’s like splash of refreshments on your under eye, I used it in the morning as well before bed.\n",
      "Line864: \"Provides intense moisture up to 26h\" and I believe that! Skin under my eyes is visibly more hydrated and glowy. Cream works really well with make up as well since it soaks in so quickly. I enjoy the verbena/lemon like scent which is also not overwhelming and dissapear with application. A little goes a long way so the price is more than reasonable. I wish it fighted fine lines also because just the hydration is not enough for me. This product is overall really good and I would recommend it in a heartbeat IF you are between 18-25 (or younger) and don't care about your fine lines (yet) OR have really dry skin.\n",
      "Line865: I love how this product works for me. It keeps my under eye area hydrated. If I missed using it I tend to get some rashes so I pretty much use it everyday. Hopefully, I will be seeing the rsults that I wanted to see in the future. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Line866: I hadn't heard of this brand before I received it for free in my Influenster VoxBox in exchange for my honest review. I love that the brand uses natural botanical ingredients, that is always a plus in my book! I've had crows feet for YEARS (thanks genetics), and have a hard time with makeup settling into the fine lines around my eyes. After using this moisturizing eye bomb for about 2 weeks now, I am already pleased to see the difference in plumpness around my eyes. This stuff is magic and I will definitely purchase when I run out! Highly reccommend!\n",
      "Line867: I’ve used a few different eye creams since giving birth earlier this year. I’m always on the hunt for the perfect one. belif’s is hands down the best I’ve used to date. It feels super creamy and hydrating but absorbs quickly. It pairs well with all of my concealers and doesn’t smear all over my face when I’m applying my makeup on top of it. I use this during the day and alternate between this and Kiehl’s creamy avocado eye cream at night. I received this product complimentary through Influenster.\n",
      "Line868: I received this product complimentary from Influenster and have been using it faithfully, morning and evening, for almost 4 weeks. I belif Moisturizing Eye Bombstruggle with fine lines (lots of outdoor sports as a teen!), dryness, puffiness, and pretty much every other issue in the eye area. I swore nothing would top my holy grail Bobby Brown, but this may just be a tough competition! The consistency is smooth and silky and the hydration is UNREAL, but absorbs so quickly and effectively. I have seen an improvement in fine lines, and this makes my eyes look brighter all day. I also love that it doesn’t irritate my eyes or eye area (which also tends to happen with eye creams for me). I’m usually unimpressed with eye creams/gels, but this one has made a fan out of me and I will definitely purchase when my first container is empty!\n",
      "Line869: Good eye cream overall, gel texture, light scent. But if you have dry skin or like thicker textures - you'll want more. I always felt like applying something on top of it. But if you're looking for light eye cream - it will work good for you. For everybody else I recommend peat miracle cream from them.\n",
      "Line870: I️ received this free in a vox box and I’m so grateful I️ did. I️ cannot comment on pricing. The quality of the product is incredible. It’s a smooth almost slippery texture/gel like that really sinks in quickly. Most eye creams I️ don’t notice much of a difference I️ just kinda use them and hope it’s a long term game but this I️ notice a hydration difference immediately. It’s almost a cooling feel too which helps with puffieness. I️ absolutely love this eye cream especially paired with the belif face moisturized, slightly heavy cream but really soaks in. I️ live in a very cold state this winter and these two products are really helping my skin!\n",
      "Line871: These cream moistorizing was my first eye cream and is a great choice! I have oil skin and leave my skin under my eye soft and brigth all day, loving these!!\n",
      "Line872: I'm always scared to try new skin products because I break out but I didn't for this product! This eye cream is very light and moisturizing and I highly recommend. I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes.\n",
      "Line873: I love this eye cream! I received it a few days ago complimentary to test out from Influenster, but I have been using Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb for over a year now and I am a huge fan. I was looking for a great eye cream with a good price and I found it. It has met all my expectations when it comes to moisturizing my eye area and improves elasticity immensely! My eye area is so smooth when using this, it really plumps up fine lines before concealer. Makeup looks good over it. As for reducing puffiness, it's not the best but if you are looking for hydration and elasticity this is \"the one\". I'm pretty much a skincare junkie, I am obsessed with Korean skincare and this is a hit in Korea! I fell in love with Belif products, I've got my mom using them too! Try it, you wont disappointed!\n",
      "Line874: This product has great vitamins packed in it and it's very creamy and light weight but at the same time very very effective also I think it works beautifully under makeup.\n",
      "Line875: I love this moisturizer so much! I purchased mine a couple months ago and it's a bit on the pricey side but it's definitely worth it. It helps keep my makeup on through the whole day. I would recommend this to everyone. One thing I love about it the most is that I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate me at all, it keeps my face feeling fresh!\n",
      "Line876: I really enjoy this eye cream. I tend to get dry under eyes and I have really sensitive skin so many eye products break me out. This does not at all! It is smooth and light and a little goes a long way. It really helps with hydration and smoothing but is not overall anti aging. If u want to start using eye cream start here.\n",
      "Line877: AMAZING. this is holy grail status. it helps so much with my extremely dry and sensitive skin. you can't go wrong with this.\n",
      "Line878: You can never go wrong with this product. I have the whole set. It's a great value not very pricey. The formula is amazing. You really do feel moisturized and hydrated both under your eyes and all over your belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb belif Don't Be Flaky Set\n",
      "Line879: I love the belif products, I use the aqua waterbomb cream and it's so lovely. It really does an amazing job and moisturizing my skin, my face gets very dry at times and I find that's the only moisturizer that truly exceeds in giving my skin the proper hydration.\n",
      "Line880: This eye cream is amazing. It is great for all skin types & def helps with wrinkles or dryness under the eye. It's soo soothing & really give the eye a boost of hydration.\n",
      "Line881: I first received this as a sample. Since then I have been a customer. It really does miracles. It's a little pricey but it is worth it.\n",
      "Line882: I like this creme for the eyes like a lot I use every day good value good price good long nice price I would like to buy again nice packaging is good affordable price I would like to recommend to other its nice its pretty good for every i love it this product\n",
      "Line883: I absolutely love the belif brand. I have several creams and one of them is the eye cream. It soaks right in and doesn't make your skin feel greasy. I love how smooth it makes your skin feel too. Others soak in and really don't make your skin feel like you did anything to it, but this doesn't disappoint. It does what it says. It's well worth it too.\n",
      "Line884: I  had to give 🌟🌟🌟🌟because of the sensitive nature of this cream,I hope the price is good and you get value for your money,am willing to try this cream whenever it's available for sampling as it will work well with my sensitive skin.\n",
      "Line885: I love the texture and how moisturizing it is. A little goes a long way. Right now I’m using a trial size once daily and it’s lasted me several weeks and there’s still so much left!\n",
      "Line886: Moisturizing but not too heavy! Kind of a gel cream consistency that sinks into the skin quickly. Slight fragrance but it does not bother my eyes.\n",
      "Line887: Love this because it’s very light and made of safe Ingredients. It does well alone or under makeup. I’ve been using it for several months and definitely will continue to and I will purchase again. Highly recommended!\n",
      "Line888: This is my favorite eye cream. It isn’t too heavy and leaves my under eyes feeling so smooth. I can see it working on my tired eyes throughout the week. The packaging is a little bulky for how much product you actually get, but I still love it\n",
      "Line889: This a decent eye cream but it just wasn’t thick enough for me personally. I have dry eye area and prefer something a little thicker. It does sink in nicely though and I think people with slightly less dry skin would really enjoy it.\n",
      "Line890: I really enjoyed this product and how soft and moisturizing it was under my eyes.. I enjoyed the texture of the product compared to others as well. I have tried many different eye creams and serums being an ipsy and boxycharm subscriber but i prefer this one most definitely.\n",
      "Line891: Great moisturizing eye cream that keeps my skin hydrated all day. Many eye creams give me milia around my eyes, but this one did not.\n",
      "Line892: This is the best eye cream to wear under makeup. My eyelids are SO sensitive to eye creams and I can 100% tolerate this one. I know the bar is really low with that statement but most eye creams make my lids red, puffy, and irritated and this one doesn’t. I only use this in the morning since it’s a better formula under makeup than the one I use at night (khiels creamy avocado)\n",
      "Line893: Nice Product, keeps under eye moisturzed, I have been using the travel size, so the packaging is really small. Not sure if I will purchase separately but I will keep using it while I have it.\n",
      "Line894: I bought a pack of sample sizes so I could try multiple Belif products. I love this bc it’s super light on the eyes yet totally hydrating.\n",
      "Line895: Very hydrating on the eyes and also very sensitive. I would repurchase this product.\n",
      "Line896: If your under eye area is dry at all, buy this! I like to keep mine in my skin care mini fridge as the coolness feels amazing under my eyes and helps with puffiness. Beyond hydration, this eye cream does nothing for dark circles or fine lines. It’s perfect for layering with other eye creams though, and with the amount of hydration it provides, it’s worth the purchase. Not to mention, a little goes a long way. The price is reasonable considering it lasts forever and minimal product is needed for full coverage of under the eyes.\n",
      "Line897: This product is really soothing around my eyes, especially during the winter months when my skin is dry. It also works well for dry and flaky patches on your face without making your skin oily or greasy.\n",
      "Line898: I have never found an eye cream that I could actually tell a difference from but this one is so smoothing and hydrating, but it doesn’t leave a weird residue or sticky feeling on my skin. It also has a slight cooling feeling and I love the way it smells.\n",
      "Line899: This is so lightweight but very hydrating! It smooths our the skin making a perfect base for concealer. I have very sensitive eyes and this doesn’t bother me at all. A little bit goes a long way. Def recommend.\n",
      "Line900: Such a beautiful, light weight & hydrating eye moisturizer! Def recommend and a little goes a LONG way!!\n",
      "Line901: I really like this eye cream.  It is a light cream that has a cooling effect upon application.  It absorbs quickly and leaves my eye area feeling very moisturized and soft to the touch.  It does not leave a residue.  It has a light pleasant slightly floral scent I would recommend trying this cream.  I plan to repurchase it in the future.\n",
      "Line902: Belief Moisturizing Eye Bomb is a very nice lightweight eye cream that goes very well under makeup. It really smooths the under eye area without being greasy, good for sensitive eyes and skin, very gentle and has a cooling feel.\n",
      "Line903: I received this product free form Influenster for testing purposes! This product really grew on me after continued use. I have not always been one to use skincare but recently have sought out quality products that do what they say they will. I didn’t notice any differences with fine lines but believe it does do a great job hydrating (which could impact fine lines long term). I feel as if this product would be great to use in colder temperatures for additional hydration. :)\n",
      "Line904: Love it! This product is the real deal! Firstly, I do love belif products, but this eye bomb lives up to my expectations. It has the classic rich, moisturizing gel. A little goes a long way. You will look more awake and refreshed! Layers well with other@skincare products and dries down quickly.\n",
      "Line905: My sensitive skin soaked this right up! The lid twists off easily which is important because of my arthritis AND my hands are usually damp during my skincare routine. I noticed a difference within a few days.\n",
      "Line906: Leaves the under eye area super hydrated and supple. Not a sticky formula.  The packaging fits the name; it’s an aqua bomb. More than met my expectations! If you’re getting to the age where you’re needing an eye cream this is a must try! Belif makes great products, this is no exception.\n",
      "Line907: I have been using this eye cream for a little over a month and it works well on my eyes. It's not greasy and goes on easily. A little does go a long long way. I highly recommend trying this one.\n",
      "Line908: This product is hydrating and gentle  to sensitive skin. Although this product is pricey, it works.\n",
      "Line909: I got/received a mini size of the belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. I've tried & love their moisturizing bomb for my dry skin & my SO loves their aqua bomb for his normal/combo skin. The eye bomb has a gel like consistency but is slightly on the thicker side - similar to the moisturizing bomb. However, it feels really moisturizing on the skin. It has a soft / barely there scent which is nice. I would definitely consider purchasing the full size product.\n",
      "Line910: Moisture Bomb is the name and Moisture is its game. Omg if you have dry skin you need to check this out. I use it to help my skin get some extra moisture during these summer months. The texture is so smooth. I have fine lines around my eyes but when I use this under eye moisturizer my concealer doesn't settle in my lines.\n",
      "Line911: Love this eye treatment. One of my favorite. I use it every night before bed. And can already see results after 2 weeks!\n",
      "Line912: This is a great eye cream. It definitely adds moisture to the under eye area. I typically use it as my nighttime eye cream.\n",
      "Line913: Absolutely loved this eye cream! It’s incredibly light and has a subtle but nice scent to it. My eyes definitely feel hydrated and moisturized after apply this! For sure purchasing more in the future\n",
      "Line914: My friend got me this for my bday and so far I’ve been thoroughly enjoying this baby. It hydrated your under eyes really well. I think it’s basically a light weight moisturizer for your eyes. If you have dry under eyes this is your dream. If you want to brighten then this isn’t your thing.\n",
      "Line915: Amazing!!! So hydrating, goes on smooth, absorbs well and stays hydrated. My favorite eye cream. The smell is great too. I'm a repeat user of the eye bomb, going back after trying a few others. The color of the jar is beautiful too. Love it!! My fav!\n",
      "Line916: I get super dry eyes that flake if I don’t use the right kind of eye cream. I’ve been using this for a year and love it!! It always makes my eyes bright and keeps them soft and hydrated.\n",
      "Line917: This eye cream is simply amazing I have really dry eyes and I wear contacts this is instant hydration in life it also helps with my dry teary-eyes! ￼ I also got this from Influenster and ordered more from Ulta because I liked it so much!! ￼\n",
      "Line918: I am not an eye cream expert so I will just give my honest review about the Eye Bomb. I’ve tried another eye creams before and this one is not spectacular nor a bad one. I liked that it is not too heavy! It has a lightweight texture and it does give a good feeling of moisture. Not sure about the 26hr long lasting hydration, but I like applying at night due to the extra moisture. For my taste, it is too watery for applying makeup on top (depending on the makeup).\n",
      "Line919: This product does make my face feels very hydrated.  I do work outside for atleast 12 hours so when it is applied it does feel as if my skin is absorbing it all !! Love it\n",
      "Line920: This is a good hydrating eye cream and honestly the best part about it is how much product you get. I think this eye cream lasted me for almost a year even while I was using it daily! It layers well under makeup and really moisturizes the eye area well\n",
      "Line921: LOOOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE! The gel formula gives a great cooling feeling under the eye. It’s so hydrating and goes well under makeup. Will buy again and again for sure.\n",
      "Line922: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb This eye cream let the skin so hydrated, it has worked me with my eye contour concerns, it’s not greasy or heavy, perfect! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line923: Love this eye moisturizer! It literally plumps up the skin around my eyes. Makes them feel so good!\n",
      "Line924: I just started using this product and already love it. It has a slight cooling affect that feels so refreshing and it helps with my under eye circles.\n",
      "Line925: I received a sample from allure and omg do I love it. I have a hard time finding something to use around my eyes because that is the most sensitive part of my face and I always seem to get red bumps or burning to a lot of products. But not this. This is such a soothing, moisturizing eye cream. I will absolutely be buying this. It is love at first try.\n",
      "Line926: I bought this a few weeks ago after my eyelids getting extremely dry, red, and flakey from using retinol on my face. I have very oily skin, and have never experienced this with my eyes - it was very uncomfortable. This eye cream is magic in a jar! I will be using this from now on. Not only is it incredibly hydrating, but it visibly improved the darkness, fine lines, and elasticity around my eyes. Great value, little goes a long way. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Line927: Really great eye cream. I use it every night! It really hydrates the sensitive area without causing milia. The only thing I will say is that you can’t use this under makeup. It is way too heavy. Works best as a night treatment!\n",
      "Line928: I received the belif moisturizing eye bomb in my monthly ispy bag. I love how smooth and silky it feels before I even put it on. After applying the a few days I noticed how the skin around around my eyes feel hydrated and refreshed. My only complaint is that I wish I got a bigger jar, but alittle goes along ways.\n",
      "Line929: This eye bomb is definitely the bomb!! It’s extremely hydrating and has a thick balm consistency. This is the last step in my routine and it smooths out the eye area and seals in moisture. A little bit goes a very long way and I’m so pleased to have found this.\n",
      "Line930: This is pretty nice but I think it would be better for someone with dryer under eyes than myself.  It was a bit too hydrating, although I may revisit this in the winter time.\n",
      "Line931: probably one of the better eye creams i have tried. my eyes are sensitive, this one does not burn like a few i have tried.\n",
      "Line932: The consistency of this cream was nice and absorbed quickly. Unfortunately I cannot say how well it works with longer use, as the fragrance was one that I can not tolerate around my face, so had to wash it off to avoid eye irritation.\n",
      "Line933: This is a really nice eye cream. It does hydrate but is lightweight so it is not likely to cause milia bumps under the eye. It looks great under concealer. I don’t think I will repurchase because I need a little more than just hydration but it is a great one if that’s all you’re looking for!\n",
      "Line934: This is my favorite eye cream! I put it on before bed and in the morning. A little goes a long way and it definitely helps get rid of lines and darkness. I have my boyfriend use this after we go out or if he’s been working late so it works on all skin types. I have sensitive skin but I LOVE it!\n",
      "Line935: I love this eye cream texture. It’s almost like Vaseline, but it melts in effortlessly and hydrated immediately.  The moisturize definitely helps my eyes look more awake and helps diminish lines. A great eye cream!\n",
      "Line936: Belif eye cream has been the only eye cream I've ever repurchased. I'm usually a believer in using the same cream on my eye area as the rest of my face. This stuff feels ultra luxurious and smells incredibly earthy and natural, yet fresh. The essential oils do not irritate my delicate eye area. I do wish it came in a pump bottle instead of a jar, because I try to avoid contamination with my eye area products. The gel-like feel is very cooling, even if you store this away from a refrigerator!\n",
      "Line937: The sides of my eyes get really dry and this is such a nice relief for that. It feels great and refreshing.\n",
      "Line938: Actually amazing. Apply under concealer for a smooth application and a plumped under eye. Will keep buying this!\n",
      "Line939: My eyes are very sensitive so I could not be liveral with this cream. However, I do love how it makes my skin lool refreshed.\n",
      "Line940: I love the cooling effect this eye cream gives. I put it on before bed and I wake up with hydrates eyes.\n",
      "Line941: Love this eye cream.  So moisturizing and does not leave your face looking caked on. I can put makeup over it or just leave as is. It blends super well into my skin and makes my fine lines under my eyes disappear.  I have super sensitive skin so this was perfect for me without adding irritation. The price point is fair for what you are paying for. This was my first purchase, and will definitely get another when I run out. My eyes look 10 years younger.\n",
      "Line942: I am a big fan of Belif products. I received this .15 oz sample in a Beauty Box. It is a blue gel that goes on easily and is absorbed quickly. Does it improve elasticity? Not that I can tell, but how is that measured by a couple of weeks use? Does it last 26 hrs? Again hard to prove. But it is a nice moisturizer that would be great in summer or warm climates.\n",
      "Line943: I love this product because it’s lightweight and the eye bomb absorb fast.  I love this eye bomb a lot during  the warmer months.  This product is a great price point.  This eye bomb also works well with make up.\n",
      "Line944: Super hydrating eye moisturizer. Works super well during the day and night. Very effective at what it is supposed to do\n",
      "Line945: I haven't been using it long enough to tell you long term benefits, but the products comes with sooooo much and it really does feel moisturizing. I use this at night because it's like a little hydrating mask.\n",
      "Line946: A nice moisturizing eye cream that’s not too irritating, despite the essential oils present. I felt that it was a bit overpriced, though, and you could get similar results from a face cream while having a lower cost and no fragrance. I would recommend this if you really want an eye cream, but otherwise, it’s just a glorified moisturizer.\n",
      "Line947: I wouldn’t call this a cream exactly, it’s like a really silky fluffy gel almost? It feels so amazing, soaks in really well, feels super soft and silky, my eyes stay hydrated allllll day, wears great under my makeup. I get tons of eye creams from all my subscription boxes, that’s how I ended up with this one, I wish I would have tried it sooner, but I will definitely be purchasing a full size soon. A little goes a long way.\n",
      "Line948: Belif hat wirklich tolle Produkte, ich denke da kann man nicht viel falsch machen. Allerdings hatte ich bei dem Preis einfach höhere Erwartungen. Ich hatte mir ein deutliches Gefühl der Hydratisierung der Augenpartie erhofft und das ist nicht ganz eingetroffen. Ich neige schon zu Trockenheitsfältchen unter den Augen. Die Creme pflegt die Haut, keine Frage, aber ich hatte nicht dieses „meine Haut fühlt sich an als hätte sie grad ein Glas Wasser getrunken“ in Ermangelung einer passenderen Beschreibung. Zudem hat mich gestört, dass man aufpassen muss die Creme nicht auf die Wimpern zu bekommen, dass es sonst in den Augen brennt. Auch dieser Faktor ist sicherlich bei vielen anderen Augencremes zu beachten, für mich jedoch etwas lästig, weshalb ich da gern zu „verträglicheren“ Varianten greifen würde. Insgesamt würde ich sagen, dass die Creme dem Hype für mich nicht ganz gerecht werden konnte. Möglicherweise waren meine Ansprüche allerdings auch überzogen: das mag ich nicht beurteilen, da ich bisher noch nicht viele Cremes ausprobiert habe.\n",
      "Line949: I love this product makes my skin feel so hydrated and makes my eyes look brighter. It’s non greasy!\n",
      "Line950: One of my favorite eye creams. Light and potent. Gentle and effective. Love that combination. Nothing too heavy or too watery. You can feel the effects as soon as you apply it. (Similar effect for me as GLAM eye)\n",
      "Line951: Love this eye cream! I purchase mine from Avon (since, I am a Rep) and use it daily! Honestly, a pack of natural hydration. Gentle.  What more could I ask for? Except for a lower price. It is pricey, but the value of the product is amazing.\n",
      "Line952: I got a sample of this and really liked it. Very hydrating although I’m not sure it helps with lines.\n",
      "Line953: I have terrible eczema around my eyes and this is one of the few products gentle enough to not make it flare up. If you have sensitive, temperamental skin this is for sure worth trying. It's gentle yet ultra hydrating and a little goes a very long way.\n",
      "Line954: I have never been overly impressed with any eye cream until this one. Most of them have actually been irritating to my eyes but for whatever reason this one, even though it has fragrance, is totally fine for me. It’s extremely hydrating under my eyes and makes them look less tired and less puffy.\n",
      "Line955: It was okay....I definitely like the Sephora brand more...don’t really have any complaints I just didn’t really like the texture\n",
      "Line956: Amazing moisturizing eye bomb.  I use it before my primer for eye makeup. Feels not greasy, goes on smooth.  Perfect for the eye area.  Vey gentle for my eye area. I stock up on this, and love this brand.\n",
      "Line957: This is my go to moisturizer. I have tried so many different moisturizers and always come back to this. It is thick but absorbs quickly and leaves my skin smooth. Living in the Midwest I need all the moisture I can get in the winter!\n",
      "Line958: Very moisturizing and a great consistency. I’ve not had any issues and seems to do a good job. I use at night before bed.\n",
      "Line959: I am utterly obsessed with Korean beauty and skincare products. I follow a strict 10 step K Beauty skincare routine. So I was very excited to try this eye cream from Belif. I am 29 and beginning to see the early signs of aging.   I tried to give this a chance, therefore I purchased it twice and used it over a year. Unfortunately, this made NO difference as far as fine lines and dark circles. It is great as far as moisturizing the delicate eye area, but I would NOT recommend this to those looking to address signs of aging.\n",
      "Line960: Love this lightweight moisturizer for the summer! It’s simple and hydrating. I’ve recommended it to others who also enjoy it. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line961: I received a sample of this in a Belif kit and I’m sad to say it sat untouched in my skincare collection for way too long. I wasn’t a big believer in eye moisturizers, but after using it for a few weeks, I don’t think I can ever go back. The skin around my eyes feels firmer yet soft, makeup sits much better, and hopefully it’s helping percent wrinkles!\n",
      "Line962: Solid eye cream, I didn’t notice any immediate difference but these things never work like that. It’s nice to use in the morning, I store it in the fridge for a cooling effect, my eyes feel awake after using this product so I’m happy with it.\n",
      "Line963: I really enjoy this product but I wish it was just a tiny bit more hydrating. The scent is nice and it goes on really well but I feel like it could be slightly more hydrating which is why I gave it four stars. Would recommend to others\n",
      "Line964: I was on a hunt looking for an eye-cream because I noticed that my eye area toward my temples seemed to be drying out. I purchased this eye bomb hoping that it would hydrate and soothe my eye area but it didnt do much. For a fairly large price of the eyebomb, I didnt see much difference. Yes it did hydrate however thats all it did. Just hydrate, it was the soles purpose of this product to hydrate your eye area yet I wasn't satisfied with its limited abilities. I feel like with the price of this eyebomb, I dont think it was worth it and I am sure that there is more eye-creams or gels that can do so much better within the same price range. When I did use it, it didnt help soothe my dryness and I would wake up with dry-patches in the morning. I dont think this product is worth it.\n",
      "Line965: I thought this was a nice product. The gel formula felt really nice and calming. However I did not see any reduction of fine lines, I think all this did was maybe calm the area around my eye for a while that’s about it!\n",
      "Line966: Got this product as a gift. I absolutely love it. I never before used anything for my eyes but this product just changed it for me. Absolutely love it\n",
      "Line967: Not too overly moisturizing but still a pretty good eye cream. Not too much in the bottle but a very good price point\n",
      "Line968: This is a lovely eye cream. It feels soft, smooth, and cool upon application, and it dries down really well. The under eye area feels moisturized and calm when using the belife Eye Bomb. I really do enjoy all of the products in this line from belief.\n",
      "Line969: This is a great moisturizing eye cream! I apply after cleansing in the am and pm. I'm not sure if my under eye looks more youthful (maybe they will over time), but they are hydrated and have a nice glow. It's easy to massage under the eye and does not make my skin burn like other eye creams have done in the past.\n",
      "Line970: Great hydrating eye cream. Very basic helped with moisture but nothing else. It didn’t cause any irritation and is a nice consistency. If you are looking for hydration this is great\n",
      "Line971: Love the texture of this product and how it soaks into the skin super easily, great product!\n",
      "Line972: A little goes a long way with this eye cream and the tub is on the larger side compared to most eye creams in this price range. It’s silky and spreads easily. The packaging is nice, easy to open and you’ll be able to get all of the product out. It’s very moisturizing and feels good on my skin.\n",
      "Line973: Didn’t feel much of a difference, good for hydrating the under eye but not her benefits. Like to apply it as a under eye mask during the night.\n",
      "Line974: I rarely use eye creams because they just seem like thicker moisturizers to me but I got a sample size of this and it did help out on some of the dry patches I have around my eyes. Nothing a moisturizer couldn’t do though tbh. Also the fragrance burned a bit.\n",
      "Line975: This makes my eyes feel so hydrated and awake when I use it! I have tried so many eye creams before and I finally found one I enjoy\n",
      "Line976: One of my all time favorite eye creams!! It’s sooo rich without causing congestion. My skin feels so hydrated with this. I use it both am and pm.\n",
      "Line977: I love this eye cream to wear under makeup. While it doesn’t have any brightening effect for my dark circles, it keeps my under eye makeup smooth and really helps to prevent creasing. Feels great when chilled in a fridge!\n",
      "Line978: I love this eye product. I receive a deluxe sample and it lasted me a whole month. A little goes a long way with this eye gel. It smells fresh and soaks right in. It’s hydrating and does just as advertised. I also find it gentle on my sensitive skin and it doesn’t sting at all unlike some other eye creams.\n",
      "Line979: This product feels good underneath the eyes, but I didn’t notice much moisture being added to my skin. I expected a little more from this product, but as of now I will continue to use it until I can find one that’s a little more moisturizing.\n",
      "Line980: I love this eye bomb. It has a smell and it feels so refreshing on my skin. It’s not greasy and sinks right into the skin.\n",
      "Line981: Belif is always a solid brand for skin care for me and this eye cream is no different. I’m currently using it as the second to  last step in my nighttime routine and have been really happy with it. My undereyes feel moisturized when I wake up in the morning and haven’t had any irritation from using it nightly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good moisturizing eye cream.\n",
      "Line982: I have mix feeling with this eye cream . Provided very hydration to your eye area , but no improve for fine lines or dark circles\n",
      "Line983: Very hydrating/moisturizing. The gel feels cool under your eyes which is a plus and can depuff. I personally don’t feel the need to have a dedicated eye moisturizer. This is not as rich as a traditional eye cream. No complaints but not a product I would add to my routine.\n",
      "Line984: I am constantly trying new eye creams and come across so many that do nothing. This one show results quickly. Worth the money.\n",
      "Line985: Great product.  Works well at doing what it promises to do and quickly.  You'll notice a difference after a few nights using it.\n",
      "Line986: I just finished a  sample size of this eye cream and I will for sure be purchasing the full size. It was very hydrating and refreshing. It does have a light scent but I don’t mind it. I would definitely recommend this product if you’re looking for a good moisturizing eye product.\n",
      "Line987: FABULOUS consistency and oodles if moisture are in this lovely eye cream. It smells good, doesn't irritate, or cause any unwanted eruptions.  It fits in well with the other products I use and does a great job.\n",
      "Line988: If you have sensitive skin, I would advise you to steer clear of this product. I started using it last week, and within 2 days I had chemical burns around both eyes. My eyelid skin is peeling, and the entire area is reddish brown and on fire. I will never use another product from this brand.\n",
      "Line989: I love this eye cream! The price is awesome! It is thick and luxurious feeling. It moisturizes so well. It doesn’t make my eyes burn when they water or irritate them. Love it!\n",
      "Line990: Really like this eye cream. I apply it nightly with my night skin routine and really feel like it has made a difference with fine lines around my eyes.\n",
      "Line991: I love this because it helps are on my eye drain is a lot and stopped all the small bombs this is honestly a life saver￼\n",
      "Line992: Wish I could give this 6 stars. It’s. That. Good.  I’m almost 30 & my skin under my eyes has never looked better. Looking to try more from this brand.\n",
      "Line993: Best eye cream! I use this eye cream with my nighttime routine usually. It leaves my under eyes moisturized and has a great smell! I love waking up and having that soft glow under my eyes!\n",
      "Line994: I really liked this. It was thick and felt really moisturizing ever time I put it on.  A little went a long way. I never noticed much of a scent which I can always appreciate.\n",
      "Line995: I’ve only had a small sample of this, but it has a lovely whipped consistency and definitely feels hydrating.\n",
      "Line996: Standard eye cream. Does provide hydration but it’s not groundbreaking. Would not pay upwards of $40 for this.\n",
      "Line997: This is a great eye cream! I love it for daytime use. Not sure if it helps with darkness or wrinkles but is very hydrating.\n",
      "Line998: This eye cream hydrated my eyes so well!! It is one of my favorite eye moisturizers. I have purchased this over and over again. I highly recommend.\n",
      "Line999: Amazing eye cream! You need a tiny amount for both eyes, it's awesome, it'll last you a long time. It absorbs right into my skin. Would definitely get it again in the future. Very gentle and not too rich. Doesn't give me milia under my eyes!\n",
      "Line1000: So moisturizing but doesn’t leave a heavy feeling. Very emollient and absorbs into under eyes very well. Best for a night time eye cream but can be used during the day.\n",
      "Line1001: This product is also very light yet very moisturizing for under the eyes. A little pricey for the amount you get, but it works very well with the moisturizer\n",
      "Line1002: Love this eye cream. As someone with sensitive skin, this works really well under my eyes and is non irritating. I use this as my daytime/morning eye cream on top of serums.\n",
      "Line1003: This is great for before makeup application because it makes your under eyes really hydrated and supple looking. I think it actually prevents makeup creasing in fine lines. 4 stars because it is an extra step that can be avoided with the belif Aqua bomb!\n",
      "Line1004: THE BEST eye cream on the market. Not greasy or too heavy under the eye, but still hydrating. It soaks in quickly. Makes my under eyes look and feel so much smoother and softer\n",
      "Line1005: I’ve been using this for about 2 years and I think it works great for keeping your under eye moisturized.\n",
      "Line1006: I would skip this product. I don’t think this really did anything for the skin around my eyes. Personally, to me this feels no different than my regular face lotion. Sometimes when my skin is extra dry it actually burns the skin a little.\n",
      "Line1007: I love this product because it is one of the best on the market, I don't know what my life would be like without this product, I simply love it, it has made my life more beautiful. Amazing and I love it.\n",
      "Line1008: Amazing I love the texture and how lightweight it is. I have extremely dry skin and it always feels refreshing to apply.\n",
      "Line1009: So beautiful and good. after the tonic and serum, this cream is a real panacea.  absolutely must not miss in a perfect skincare\n",
      "Line1010: I really love this product. I have really dry under eyes and this hydrates them really well. It doesn’t irritate my skin and it has a very light natural scent.\n",
      "Line1011: This eye cream is excellent. It is very moisturizing and very reasonably priced. It sinks right into your skin. I use it both morning and night and am very happy with the results.\n",
      "Line1012: I really like this eye cream. It’s a thick consistency and really keeps the under eye area moisturized. It’s been a life saver these winter months.\n",
      "Line1013: I purchased this at Sephora because my under eyes were super dry and it was painful— it’s a lightweight gel, it’s definitely hydrating and I do enjoy it. I don’t think it’s the most hydrating eye cream but it doesn’t give me milia and it does the job! A little goes a long way as well! :)\n",
      "Line1014: This is a really nice, thick, moisturizing eye cream. I think it's great to use at night. It reminds me of Aquaphor but more spreadable and luxurious feeling (and not greasy at all!). It didn't cause any irritation for me and didn't bother my eyes at all.\n",
      "Line1015: One of my favorite eye creams! Gel-like consistency with a soothing and moisturizing formula. Only downside is the open jar packaging, which is not that hygienic. Always use clean fingers and close right away!\n",
      "Line1016: I particularly love all products from this brand. The texture it's really lightweight and refreshing and this it's very good for the eye area. I love the smell also.\n",
      "Line1017: I only used this cream for a short while but it didn’t do anything for me. I will be switching back to Kiehl’s avocado eue cream\n",
      "Line1018: Deja una sensación fresca en la piel y muy suave, no se siente pegajosa ni molesta, tampoco te resécala piel\n",

      "Line1020: Love this. The texture was amazing. It felt hydrating, but not heavy. Almost like a cross between a gel and a cream.\n",
      "Line1021: I have extremely dry undereyes! I purchased this after watching a YouTubers video that raves about this. She also has really dry under eyes. Did it hydrate? I mean I guess.

      "Line1022: this product works really well but it tend to get into my ice I don't know if I was using too much of it it does meet with my expectations because I've heard so many wonderful things about it and they're did enjoy it just I don't think that it really did what it said it was going to do for the wrinkles so\n",

      "Line1037: I NEED this for my daytime eye cream. I have super dry under eyes. Most creams are made for fine lines and dark circles, but I feel like this one was made for me.\n",
      "Line1038: definitely hydrates my skin and keeps it moisturized and looking good. perfect cream\n",
      "Line1039: This has been one of the best eye creams I have ever used! It is super moisturizing and has done wonders for my fine lines and crows feet around my eyes! It makes my under eye look so nice!\n",
      "Line1040: Se siente rico debajo de los ojos. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb Súper refrescante y suave para el area, sin mucha fragancia.\n",
      "Line1041: This is a great gel formula eye cream. I like this formula in the summer when my skin isn’t as dry. It absorbs nicely into the skin but leaves a nice barrier to lock the moisture in.\n",
      "Line1042: I honestly didn't understand the hype of this. It's really not that different from a moisturizing cream, which I personally find much more hydrating than this. I also found it was causing bumps to form under my eyes, so after about 2 weeks of using this, I stopped. About 2 months out, the bumps were gone. Weird.\n",
      "Line1043: A must. This is a super-hydrating under eye moisturizer. It has minimal smell so it’s not over whelming, and light enough that it gives you that cool and refreshing feeling after application. I use this product morning and night\n",
      "Line1044: Such a great product and so moisturizing! I struggle with eczema (on my hands and eyelids) and this did not aggravate it at all and is very gentle!! You need to try it!\n",
      "Line1045: I didn’t think this was something I needed until I tried it out as a sample at Sephora!  This product is great for combination skin and is super refreshing for your eyes!  It’s not sticky or heavy for the under eye area, gives a youthful look, and I’ve seen improvement with any bags or blemishes in this area.\n",
      "Line1046: This feels like a dream under your eye! My under eye is always super dry and this seems to be the only thing that helps it. It’s a little pricey but well worth it!\n",
      "Line1047: I wish I could give this 10 stars!! I love this eye cream. It is very expensive but very worth it. My fine lines disappear and my under eye area stays hydrated easily for 12+ hours. I have repurchased this cream twice now and will continue to do so as I have yet to find anything that compares!\n",
      "Line1048: One of, if not the best eye cream I’ve ever tried. Comparable to Clinique’s All About Eyes. Absorbs much quicker than the Clinique eye cream. Highly, highly recommend.\n",
      "Line1049: Nice lightweight eye cream. It has a gel texture and it feels cooling to your under eyes. It pairs well with the aqua bomb moisturizer. It’s not as heavy and thick as other eye creams. No visible difference though, it was just a nice feeling.\n",
      "Line1050: Very beautiful eye cream. Actually it’s more of a gel consistency so it’s very light and refreshing. You can keep it in the refrigerator to give you that cooling feeling. It works perfectly under make up and it’s not scented so I don’t think it will irritate your sensitive eye area. Highly recommend!￼￼\n",
      "Line1051: I didn’t know I needed this until I got it in a gift set. Now I know what all the rave is about this eye cream!  It was a focus at NY fashion week for years In a row they knew it was like finding gold.  It’s lite creamy and fast drying. A little pricy but for how little you need to apply it will last forever!\n",
      "Line1052: This did nothing for me, it wasn't as moisturizing as i thought it would be, i would not purchase again and rather get another brand like clinique.\n",
      "Line1053: Loooovveee this eye cream. It feels amazing when applied, and after it dries I can literally feel the fine lines tightening. It works wonders and I love using it!\n",
      "Line1054: I first tried a sample of this that I picked up with my Rewards points. The sample size was thicker and more balmy than the full size, with a consistency somewhat similar to aquaphor (which I often use under my eyes to hydrate/moisturize). I liked it enough that I purchased the full size and the consistencies are slightly different. The full size is more creamy and less thick. I got another sample that was just like the full sized at a later time, so I think the initial sample was a one off.  I like them both and they do hydrate my under eyes well and absorb quickly. They also don’t irritate my sensitive eyes and play really well with makeup. One of the most important things you can do to make concealer look it’s best is have hydrated under eyes, and this does that for me. The price point may feel a little high, but this is a 25ml eye cream, where as many eye creams are only 15ml, so you’re getting 10ml more than typical eye creams. All in all though, this is a really bice hydrating eye cream.\n",
      "Line1055: I recently looked for this product on Sephora and liked the packaging. It is a great moisturizer, I would like it more if it would come in pumping bottle. Yes It worked for me and I am going to buy again.\n",
      "Line1056: I have tried both the eye and the facial bomb. Although the facial bomb is food, it is very light. I love the eye bomb though because it feels thick but smooth. It is really moisturizing for the under eye area and I love to put this under my makeup. It makes the concealer look really good.\n",
      "Line1057: This is my favorite eye cream right now. It's moisturising enough to use both day and night and it layers well under my concealer. I've noticed more firmness in my my eye area. It also has a pleasant, clean scent that isn't overwhelming. I will be replacing it when I run out!\n",
      "Line1058: Received in an Ipsy package. Was definitely very moisturizing. Did what it was supposed to and lasted a long time\n",
      "Line1059: All in all, I’m a much bigger fan of the belief products in white tubs than the ones in blue tubs like this. Gel doesn’t cut it for me now that I’m in my thirties. It could be the fragrance or other ingredients, but this actually makes my eyes feel tighter like it sucked existing moisture out. three stars because I’ve had worse but definitely not a fan.\n",
      "Line1060: If you're looking for a moisturizing eye cream with no actives, this is perfect. It leaves my undereyes hydrated and supple and it's non-irritating. However, it's lightly fragranced so if you're sensitive to scents, you may want to opt for a fragrance-free alternative. I love to keep mine in my beauty fridge and it feels so nice when it's cold!\n",
      "Line1061: If you need under eye moisture this product will definitely help you out. I felt like just after one use my under eyes looked and felt less dry. Like all belif products it comes in a tub. I prefer my eye creams to come in a tube or a squeeze pump. I definitely will repurchase as it isn’t a bad product at all.\n",
      "Line1062: Not the richest cream, which I enjoy, but it was moisturizing. I need a different type of eye cream for older eyes that have dark circles.\n",
      "Line1063: This stuff works as advertised, melts into skin nicely and reduces under eye bags. Not the most effective one I’ve tried though.\n",
      "Line1064: This is my HG eye cream! It’s super light weight, fast absorbing and wears well under makeup. It has a bit of a cooling effect when you apply it too! It’s a bit expensive, but a little goes a long way.\n",
      "Line1065: Depuffs eyes and keeps it cool. Also a great brighter as well. Gentle on the eyes. Great product.\n",
      "Line1066: I love this eye cream! It has a super soothing, cooling effect after applying and it smoothes out my under eye area, making makeup application much easier. I use this after moisturizer and before primer.\n",
      "Line1067: I noticed that the dark circles around my eyes lighted over the course of a week and the puffiness was also a lot less. I’m a huge fan of eye creams and this one is definitely one I will be purchasing in the near future.\n",
      "Line1068: I only received a sample of this to try but I absolutely loved it! The consistency is amazing - extremely hydrating while still being lightweight and easy to wear. My only complaint is the price, it is absurd and the that’s why I don’t purchase my own eye cream. It’s way too much money and unfortunately, while I loved using my sample size of this product, I cannot justify spending that much money.\n",
      "Line1069: espero que me llegue, las ojeras es mi sufrimiento de todos los dias !!! en ocasiones el maquillaje no las oculta como me gustaria espero que yo pueda probar lo bueno que esta el producto\n",
      "Line1070: I really like the formula and it’s super hydrating.  The moisture is very long lasting but never seems to fully absorb so I don’t like using under makeup.  Unfortunately it irritates my eye rosacea so it got bumped out of the rotation.\n",
      "Line1071: I have sensitive skin and my skin didn't seem to react well with this. This product was too thick for my under eyes, where I ended up having milia for weeks after just a few days of use. It smells like Proactiv, that familiar citrus smell like all other belif products, so if you're sensitive to scents then this may not be for you\n",
      "Line1072: Tired eyes from work or staring at a phone? This is the perfect instant relief. Just dab some below your eyes and the cooling sensation will make you so relaxed\n",
      "Line1073: I really enjoyed this eye cream. It was cooling and was super moisturizing. It is really easy to apply too much product, so make sure you use it sparingly. Otherwise I would recommend this product.\n",
      "Line1074: I used mini size and i love it!! Very well moisturizing my under eyes... belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb.\n",
      "Line1075: I like this eye cream because of the gel lightweight texture. If it gets into my eyes, it doesn’t sting or bother me. Usually with creams, it would travel easily from my eyelids and end up irritating my eyes for a few days. However, gave this 4 stars because I didn’t see much of a difference after using for few months. Would recommend if you’re looking for moisturizer to hydrate eye area vs. anti wrinkle benefits.\n",
      "Line1076: Crème très hydratante mais somme toute très légère. Très facile à étendre et laisse une sensation de fraîcheur.\n",
      "Line1077: Me gusta... Cómo desbanese .. me gusta su aroma... Su texturas.. es buena para mis ojos ... Me encanta..\n",
      "Line1078: To be honest I have not use this yet I just have a tiny small container of this moisturizing eye bomb that I got in my Ipsy bag. This and so many others I have yet nor tried. Hope it works great.\n",
      "Line1079: I've never tried the product before, but I like to try the new products, and i've always been able to buy them because I like them.\n",
      "Line1080: I love this I cream, it was very hydrating, beautiful under concealer and definitely helped my concealer stay set throughout the day with less creasing. There is a generous amount, and for the money I feel it is a really good one! I generally just use a cream under my make up to help stay hydrated throughout the day, and this one is one you won’t be disappointed with.\n",
      "Line1081: Working great. My eyes feel fresh and moisture after wake up. However, the texture is a little bit thicker than the Clique eyes gel that I used before, but not really a bit deal.\n",
      "Line1082: This is an excellent Under Eye moisturizer! I love this for everyday, but it’s my favorite on heavy makeup days. I’ll use it in my Under Eye are, on and around my brows, as well as around my nose and any other dry patches I see on my face. If you use a lot of powder to set your makeup or wear heavy amounts of eyeshadow, this is the product for you! It leaves my skin feeling mostly non-greasy and doesn’t mess up my makeup on any way. It’s got a nice gentle scent so I’d even recommend this for sensitive skin and every day use!\n",
      "Line1083: Me gustaría probarlo para poder dar mi opinión sobre el producto y hacer la reseña en la web y páginas sociales y recomendar a las influensters de esta web y en mi ámbito familiar y social y a las influensters de esta web y en mi ámbito familiar y social #voxbox #influenster\n",
      "Line1084: Great little eye cream. My skin feels moisturized and looks less puffy. When I first started using it I thought it had a slight cooling effect but I no longer feel it. It applies easily and offers good hydration for the price.\n",
      "Line1085: This soaks in fast. I find it refreshing in the morning. I love the whole line of products.\n",
      "Line1086: This eye cream was good, but not my favourite. It was hydrating, but it didn't seem to have any lasting hydration effects. I have. many other eye creams that I far prefer, plus this product is challenging to buy where I live.\n",
      "Line1087: I love this moisturizer because it absorbed quickly into my skin and helped plump up my skin filling in my fine lines\n",
      "Line1088: Love the fresh feeling it leaves but i haven’t noticed a real difference in my undereye.. i wouldn’t buy it again.\n",
      "Line1089: Very moisturizing eye cream so if you have dry under eyes this is a great product. However if you have dark circles this won't necessarily brighten the under eyes.\n",
      "Line1090: I got a sample of this and just ordered a whole bottle. Made the skin around my eyes so smoooooth and hydrated.\n",
      "Line1091: Very moisturizing and refreshing after a long day. It adds an extra plumpness to the under eye and smooths out any lines for my oily-combination skin.\n",
      "Line1092: This was an amazing product. I received a small sample but was instantly hooked on it. Felt so revitalizing\n",
      "Line1093: Long story short, I just didn't see any changes in my under eyes with this product. I couldn't tell if it was hydrating, changing, anything etc. I gave it a couple stars only because I liked the texture. I'm a huge fan of water based textures, so that I enjoyed. Plus it comes in a fairly decent sized jar, so I can say it is very long lasting but not something I'd purchase again.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line1094: I liked the texture and feel of this cream and had purchased it after hearing many rave reviews, but didn’t find it hydrated my under eyes as much as I was expecting it to. I did find it lasted a while, which for the price it should, but wouldn’t repurchase.\n",
      "Line1095: This is 5 star product if you need intense moisture, but I wouldn’t say that it plumps the eye area. It feels good when you put it on and dries pretty quickly. Best for cold environments or dry, flaking eye area. I don’t fall under either category but still enjoy using it every week.\n",
      "Line1096: Leaves my under eyes feeling very fresh. Very gentle, not harsh at all. I love the texture.\n",
      "Line1097: I have received the eye bomb at beautycon and in several beauty subsctiption boxes. Last a long time, a little goes a long way and eye bomb is a hydrating eye cream.\n",
      "Line1098: This moisturizing eye bomb has become my new favorite daytime addition to my skincare routine. It's the last thing I apply before the start of my day. I LOVE how lightweight it feels, how quickly it absorbs, and its refreshing, clean fragrance.\n",
      "Line1099: Love it was my first moisturizers to use and truly loved it.  It has that great gel cream consistency thats truly amazing.\n",
      "Line1100: This really is helpful for under the eyes. Creamy, light texture. Hardly a smell which is good since it goes on face and so close to eyes. I’ve been using for Awhile! Will buy again forsure.\n",
      "Line1101: i love the feel of this! it's lightweight and amazing! not greasy nor heavy. I have sensitive skin so it's been a lot of hit or miss!\n",
      "Line1102: This is an excellent cream for dry skin. It smells great, not overpowering. It's very hydrating and a little goes a long way. You don't need much so a jar lasts a really long time.  This is great especially for a product in this price range. #influensterawards #influenster #belifusa\n",
      "Line1103: I love this moisturizer!! It's the best I've found for dry skin. It's lightweight and smells great! I will continue to use it until I'm at least 100 years old\n",
      "Line1104: I bought a trial size of this product so that I could see if I liked it. I can’t really tell if it’s doing anything. It might be my fault because I use it sporadically. However, I do like the cool feeling that it has when I put it on. I like to put it on when my eyes feel puffy.\n",
      "Line1105: Da la hidratacion en la zonas de ojos me encanta 💖  lo uso diario dia y noche para prevenir las arrugas y siento esa zona super hidratada\n",
      "Line1106: I was looking for an eye cream and after looking at the reviews online, I decided to try belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. I loved it, especially after I put it in the fridge overnight, it feels cooling on my eyes. I live in a dry climate so I love that it's super moisturizing. Would definitely recommend this eye cream!\n",
      "Line1107: This is very moisturizing for my sensitive and dry under eye area. I like to use this during the day as it keeps my concealer from creasing.\n",
      "Line1108: This is ultra moisturizing. I love how it sinks in. However, one star taken because it just has an overwhelming perfume! I like scented creams. Not a problem. But the scent in this one just hits me.\n",
      "Line1109: This smells nice. When I use it, the area under my eyes feels hydrated so it definitely does its job. I don’t believe it does anything for fine lines or wrinkles though. I would still recommend it for puffy under eyes.\n",
      "Line1110: This really brought the moisture back to my eyes! I had dry under eyes from lack of sleep and stress. Although it helped minimally with dark bags, I knew I had moisturized eyes that would not dry out if I used concealer that day.\n",
      "Line1111: Great eye cream. It is very moisturizing for the under eyes. It’s a little pricey but the results are absolutely phenomenal and in the end I think it’s worth it to have such smooth and hydrated under eyes.\n",

      "Line1117: I had a trial of this product and I enjoyed it but I don’t think I would purchase due to the price point. This felt great on my under eyes. It was smooth and moisturizing. If it wasn’t so pricey I would think about purchasing.\n",
      "Line1118: I have a few eye cream options and this belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is one of my favorites, a lightweight, it's not sticky, smells fresh, and leaves my bags noticeably diminished and hydrated. I recommend it 100%\n",
      "Line1119: This product smells nice and is moisturizing, but I felt the finish it left under my eyes was oily and shiny. I didn't see any noticeable results from using it for 2 months, and eventually switched.\n",

      "Line1131: This is one of the only eye creams that doesn’t burn! It feels cooling on the under eye and surrounding area. I don’t use this product every night (in my late 20s probably should!) but when I use it my eyes love it!\n",
      "Line1132: If hydration is what you care about most under the eyes, this is great. It’s not too thick but gives a lot of hydration and sits well under makeup. It’s also nowhere near as expensive as a lot of other eye creams!\n",

I’ve only been using it for a couple weeks but I definitely see a difference, hands down the best eye cream I’ve ever tried! It’s super hydrating and lightweight, it feels really great on your skin!\n",
      "Line1137: Very moisturizing, this keeps my skin nice and soft. It absorbs quickly but I wait a little bit before layering other products to prevent piling.\n",
      "Line1138: This is a serious contender for my favorite eye cream ever. It's a little more pricey compared to some other popular eye creams on the market, but you get a ton of product, so it lasts a long time. This is super nice and hydrating; I found that my under eye area almost never looked dry and crusty, even with layers of concealer and powder, after using this product in the morning. I went through 2 or 3 of these and then took a break to try some other things, but I would definitely repurchase this and highly recommend to anyone struggling with dry undereyes.\n",
      "Line1139: This product made my under eyes look less puffy and dark. It it worked really well and didn’t feel sticky or greasy. Really loved this product.\n",
      "Line1140: I love this product and how it feels. I have very sensitive skin, specially in the under eye area and this product did not cause any irritation. It helped tremendously with lines and creases but overall I think it's a bit overpriced.\n",
      "Line1141: This is a wonderful eye cream that helps with dry, crepey under eyes. It helps with fine lines as it plumps and brightens the skin having hyaluronic acid being the main ingredient. It's also a great eye cream to start early with, in your mid twenties, to keep your under eyes looking young and delaying the development of fine lines.\n",
      "Line1142: Leaves my under eyes looking so hydrated! I love the packing and the scent. Would definitely recommend for those under bag eyes.\n",
      "Line1143: I received this in my influenster box and I’ve been trying it. Is very easily absorbed with lightweight.\n",
      "Line1144: This is a good basic cooling eye gel/ cream. The cooling affect that you get with this eye is great and I enjoy. Although I do feel like you can run out of this fast because it is so light that you might need more product. Overall it is a good eye cream if you want to splurge.￼\n",
      "Line1145: I've used better and worse eye creams before.I don't enjoy that the consistency is so firm. The viscosity is so high that you really have to pull on the eye to warm it up and move it around. If you intend to warm it up between your ring fingers you'll find a lot of it being absorbed into your fingertips. I also find that I have to use a lot of product compared to some of my other staples like the Eminence Neroli Eye Serum. I do enjoy it more than most if not all drug store eye creams I've tried before. It does leave my eyes feeling moisturized afterwards which is it's initial intention and purpose.\n",
      "Line1146: Wow this eye bomb product is so moisturizing. I just had a sample, but I loved it and would buy again. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Line1147: I am so close to giving this product 5 stars. But it’s just a bit heavy, so I typically use it at night and have no issue at all. I feel like it’s also a bit pricey but overall a great product and makes the skin under eyes feel so hydrated!\n",
      "Line1148: I used this eye cream as part of my daily morning regimen. It’s lightweight enough that the skin around my eyes absorbed it quickly and left the area feeling soft and hydrated. A little bit goes a long way, so a small amount dabbed around the eye area is plenty. I didn’t see a huge improvement with fine lines but the area certainly felt nice and hydrated. For night time I prefer a thicker cream.\n",
      "Line1149: I got this product as a free sample and received the 0.17 fl oz. size. This is my first under eye product and I didn't see much difference to be honest. First uses felt great, refreshing and lightweight. It helped with puffiness under my eyes, but not so much with fine lines. However, I don't feel it's a game changer in my skin routine. I would recommend to use it before makeup in order to protect the light under eye skin, but the 0.17 size. I've been using it for a month and because it absorbs quickly I only need to use a little bit of cream every time.\n",
      "Line1150: Very moisturizering and hydrated. I like to use it after I wash my face or before bed. Does make make tired eyes feel a lot better. Also did notice a slight difference in my dark circles when I was using it, the reason I stopped was because I'm trying to take care of my acne but when I remember to put it on it does feel refreshing.\n",
      "Line1151: I got a sa.pme of this and its amazing I had to buy full size. This is so nice and absorbing. I use at night and the morning makes my skin feel amazing\n",
      "Line1152: didn’t use it consistently enough to see results, but i liked the product. my under eyes are very sensitive and usually break out in hives from under eye creams but this one has never caused any problems for me. highly recommend for other people with sensitive skin\n",
      "Line1153: This was just meh.  It moisturized, but not much, so this is probably better for those that have greasier undereye areas.  It felt good and sunk in quickly, which I really appreciated.  It's not bad, it's just that for the price, it didn't really live up to the hype.  I think you could get much cheaper eye moisturizers that work just as well.\n",
      "Line1154: This eye cream is awesome and for the price I highly recommend this item! It hydrates well and lasts all day.\n",
      "Line1155: I love this stuff! I honestly used it all over instead of just under my eyes & it made my skin so hydrated & soft feeling & it lasted all day! A little goes a long way & it wasn’t oily, it soaked into my skin perfectly!\n",
      "Line1156: This was a gel based cream and had some fragrance to it. I did not see any dramatic results to my under eye area but it did moisturize. Not something I would run out and buy.\n",
      "Line1157: I really like this eye cream, especially to wake me up in the morning and decrease puffiness. I have very sensitive skin and this product did not irritate it at all. Unfortunately, if I use my laroche posay moisturizer under this eye cream, it pills up. But, no other combination of a moisturizer has done the same thing. I use it in the morning and the night and has helped the psoriasis on my eyelids!\n",
      "Line1158: This was fine, it's kind of a generic moisturizing eye cream. I felt like it worked fine and you need so little that the container lasts forever. Kept my eye area moisturized but I don't know that it specifically made any difference beyond that.\n",
      "Line1159: Very good for fine lines and dry skin. I use at night and help me a lot when i use the concealer\n",
      "Line1160: Amazing texture! Really refreshing and calming to the under eye. It does the job hydrating but I need to use a lot to mantain my fine lines filled. It’s a very basic but must have!!\n",
      "Line1161: Este producto me llegó en una de las suscripciones de Sephora, y pensé que daba resultados hasta que lo probé, me he quedado encantada, enamorada y obsesionada con este producto, sinceramente lo volvería a comprar si tuviese el dinero aunque sea un poco costoso.\n",
      "Line1162: Meh. For me it was a flop. I have under eye bags and dark circles.. and it doesn’t helped + I had allergy. Felt itching.. Tried it for a few times and every single of them was the same\n",
      "Line1163: Very moisturizing. I prefer to use this at night, as it is richer and takes longer to absorb.\n",
      "Line1164: Love this eye cream. It’s super hydrating and I love the formula and consistency of it. It makes my under eyes feel super hydrated.\n",
      "Line1165: I think this eye moisturizer is just ok! I do think it could be soothing if your under-eye area is uncomfortable or dry. For me it hasn’t really done much of anything. I will continue to use it but I won’t repurchase.\n",
      "Line1166: It works like magic. Moisturizes my eye lids very much! Excellent product! Thankyou for sending it to me for Free!\n",
      "Line1167: This eye cream is such a dream. It’s such a lightweight texture and it leaves the skin underneath my eyes unbelievably happy. I love bringing it with me whenever I travel and have to take a flight because the air in the plane makes my skin so so so dry. All in all, it gets the job done and does exactly what I want an eye cream to do. That being said, I know that eye creams can be pricey and this one is expensive as well. However, you only need the smallest amount every time and a jar will easily last several months for me.\n",
      "Line1168: I love this eye cream. It’s perfect for moisturizing the under eye area and has no scent which I love. Only downside is it’s pretty pricey.\n",
      "Line1169: This is a very nice gel like eye cream.￼ you get a soothing, cooling sensation when you apply it. I didn’t really notice any changes under my eyes. However it’s still a nice product when you need a little extra hydration or cooling under your eyes. ￼\n",
      "Line1170: I normally use this product as a part of my skincare routine before bed. Especially since it goes around your eyes I’m really glad that there is no fragrance in this product. It is moisturizing and absorbs well without being greasy. I don’t currently struggle with a lot of lines under my eyes, so it’s hard to me to judge it’s affect on those, so for now I use this as a preventative measure and just to try to take good care of my skin! I received this product complimentary for review from Influenster.\n",
      "Line1171: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb Amazing! Love to use this at night it just hydrates my under eyes. Not greasy. I love it.\n",
      "Line1172: While I love the thin/watery consistency of this eye cream, I have found that if I don’t use the tiniest (and I mean TINIEST) amount, it will begin to cause milia underneath my eyes and that hasn’t happened to me in the past with other eye creams.\n",
      "Line1173: This is the belif moisturizing eye bomb that helps hydrate underneath your eyes! Use every 26 hours\n",
      "Line1174: Hydrating eye cream with a pleasing gel/ creamy texture that sinks in quickly. I apply it in the morning and at night, and it feels refreshing. I’m still young (23), so my main goal is to hydrate the skin and preserve the elasticity and thickness of the skin around my eyes. This product does just that!\n",
      "Line1175: This stuff is amazing! I had been suffering from dry, flaky skin underneath my eyes, and I bought a hydration set from Sephora for $23. A mini of this was included. I’ve been using it for a few days now, and my eyes look so much better! The dryness is almost gone completely and I am no longer waking up with red puffy eyes! I’m so glad I bought this! It doesn’t burn when applying, either!\n",
      "Line1176: Very moisturizing. I love the minty feel when you apply it under your eyes. I religiously used this for over a month as it was gifted to me. Helped with the overall hydration I was lacking. Great product!\n",
      "Line1177: This eye cream is nice and extremely hydrating under the eyes. However I would only recommend using it at night because it would “ball up” sometimes on my skin so I wouldn’t want to put my makeup over it during the day. I think it is worth trying out but I wouldn’t repurchase.\n",
      "Line1178: Lightweight but hydrating. Sinks in. Doesn’t make my makeup pill on top. Really nice. It feels cooling on the skin to me as well!\n",
      "Line1179: I've never bought a full size of this product, but I've had sample sizes from the Sephora point system and every time this is available I always get 5 because of how moisturizing and small it is. I've never bought the full size because I still have eye cream at home.\n",
      "Line1180: Really enjoy this product at night. Definitely very hydrating for the under eyes. Makes me look fresh and rested in the morning.\n",
      "Line1181: Worked well. No complaints. Very hydrating. Compared to neutrogena hydro boost. Very hydrating and water based.\n",
      "Line1182: I received this product in my vox box and am in love with it. I’ll be purchasing this all year long. I actually use it in the morning and at night. Its so hydrating which is amazing for my dry skin. I feels so smooth and cool going on. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Line1183: This product is ok. It moisturizes my under eyes but no more than a regular moisturizer would. Might work better for someone else with really dry under eyes.\n",
      "Line1184: Super basic eye cream. Hydrating, but I didn’t see almost any results. Does the trick if you just want something to moisturize the area.\n",
      "Line1185: Don’t really see how it has great ratings. It’s definitely moisturizing but that’s about it, it doesn’t do anything special.\n",
      "Line1186: I have received a few deluxe samples of this, and I'm always happy to get it in my beauty subscriptions. It really is a hydrating bomb! My skin drinks it right up & feels/looks plump and youthful.\n",
      "Line1187: This eye cream feels amazing and is very moisturizing however the smell is horrible. But that just my opinion\n",
      "Line1188: This eye cream is the only one I’ve tried that really reduces puffiness under my eyes. I do have a few skin lines running under my eyelids and this cream will firm them up and make them less noticeable. The only reason I haven’t repurchased is the price is a bit too high. The end of the cream in the tub can get dried out quickly too, making it hard to use up\n",
      "Line1189: This eye cream is honestly the best I have ever used. I will be continuing to buy this!! It has a cool smell that feels very natural. It also leaves my eyes feeling super moisturized and just looking lovely.\n",
      "Line1190: I use this daily and can’t say enough about it. Smoothed my dry under eyes to allow my makeup to glide on. It feels great after a long day.\n",
      "Line1191: I often forget about eye cream, but I have this one and I like it! It feels very moisturizing. Just make sure not to get it too close to your eyes or else they’ll start watering\n",
      "Line1192: It leaves a soothing feeling on your skin. It fulfills it’s purpose as a moisturizer.\n",
      "Line1193: I really enjoy this product. I received a sample recently and I can tell it’s doing something after just a few uses. It tingles and I wake up without poofy eyes when I use it at night.\n",
      "Line1194: Doesn’t do anything special but super gentle and moisturizing. I do really like it, but it’s not my holy grail.\n",
      "Line1195: this product is very nice It is very good for the eyes not help me did use my dark circles and other eye problem or impurities and repeated use this product it is amazing\n",
      "Line1196: New fav eye moisturizer! Super lightweight and hydrating. Effective. Good for those hangover eyes\n",
      "Line1197: I truly love this eye cream. It is perfect for the dry winter months. It kept my eye moist and soft. Would I buy again> yes. In the winter\n",
      "Line1198: Very moisturizing. The container will last you forever considering a little goes a long way. Thinner texture but doesn’t interfere with my makeup application\n",
      "Line1199: This eye bomb was a complete surprise. It improve my eye area greatly and absorb easily!\n",
      "Line1200: While I don’t think an eye cream is necessary in a skin care routine, this one is nice. It is very hydrating but lightweight. It has a pleasant spa like smell. I feel that this product is so similar to their regular moisture bomb moisturizer for the face, so if you have that one you could probably just use it under the eyes as well.\n",
      "Line1201: Deseo probar esta marca y sus productos para poder recomendarlo y seguir usándolo\n",
      "Line1202: Esta crema me encanta , lo uso en mi rutina de noche y me ha ayudado muchisimo a controlar esas arrugas en los ojos vale la pena el precio\n",
      "Line1203: I use this every night. Even when I sometimes switch up eye creams, I feel like I always go back to this one. Just wish it would help more with dark circles.\n",
      "Line1204: I love this I cream, it is super hydrating and has such good, clean ingredients.  I like keeping it in the refrigerator and dabbing a bit on in the morning to help wake me up and give me those bright eyes!￼￼￼\n",
      "Line1205: I tend to opt for eye serums instead of moisturizers because my eye area is very sensitive and I usually end up developing milia. However this eye bomb is somewhere in between in the sweet spot and works wonderfully.\n",
      "Line1206: THE BEST EYE CREAM! Belif is such an underrated brand- all of their products are top notch!\n",
      "Line1207: My favorite eye cream especially during the winter time. It’s incredibly hydrating but not in a greasy way. It blends in so well and sits nicely on the eye. It doesn’t make concealer crease at all either. I love using this with the Belif aqua bomb for some all around extra hydration.\n",
      "Line1208: I just recently started using a sample of this eye cream and I am liking it so far! Still too soon to tell if it’s minimizing lines/wrinkles but if anything my under eyes are looking more hydrated when I wake up in the morning!\n",
      "Line1209: Really nice eye cream, feels refreshing and cooling on my skin and it feels good after a long day. I like the scent and the consistency.\n",

      "Line1211: This is like the true cream for your eyes. Love the light gel texture and the way my eyes feel moisturized after use.\n",
      "Line1212: Very moisturizing. I spread this from my eyes around my face to preserve some moisture before my regular moisturizer. I also like the way it smells and how light and easy it is to spread around. It doesn’t feel heavy or too watery. I recommend it to dry skinned people.\n",
      "Line1213: This is my 2nd favorite eye product behind murad. It feels almost like a jelly, smooths on super easy. Feels very nice on the eyes and is effective. It lessens my under eye bags and helps with crows feet.\n",
      "Line1214: I don’t think eye cream is that important in skin care but this eye cream definitely improved the texture under my eyes. It was light and non greasy.\n",
      "Line1215: I have dark circles under my eyes. I used this product with my evening routine and noticed a big difference the next morning. It made the dark circles brighter and not as noticeable. The skin was so soft and fine lines were less noticeable. I recommend this product and am anxious to try other products from this company.\n",
      "Line1216: I got this product in a set but I love it I have gone back to buy a full sized one and it is super moisturizing and good with sensitive skin\n",
      "Line1217: I was always a huge fan of Belif. I’ve been using their products since high school and I knew this product was not going to disappoint! I apply this under my eyes morning and night and it quickly absorbs into my skin leaving my under eyes looking awake and moisturized!\n",
      "Line1218: Got this in my last influenster box and i absolutely love it!! It is pricey but a little goes such a long way so i’d say it’s definitely worth it\n",
      "Line1219: I've been using this for a few weeks since I received it in the Spring into Summer VoxBox and I'm honestly underwhelmed. I've heard great things about this moisturizer so I was so excited to try it. I love the gel texture since it sinks into your skin, but was put off by the scent. I have sensitive skin so I try to steer from scented products and this one smells a bit like eucalyptus. Since using it, I haven't seen much of a difference in my under eyes. I will continue to use the sample, but probably wouldn't repurchase.\n",
      "Line1220: I got a sample of this and it was only okay. What I expect from an eye cream is brighter eyes, supple skin, and depuffing but this just fell short of what I was looking for.\n",
      "Line1221: Got this as a sample and have been using it in small amounts because I really like it and can’t afford the full sized version lol. Nice and creamy texture, no discernible smell. Feels good on the sensitive eye skin.\n",
      "Line1222: I am very careful with facial products because my skin is very sensitive.  I decided to test this product that I received by VoxBox Influencer and I am very satisfied.  My eye region is very dry and I have dark circles under my eyes.  My first impression was how effective the product is for hydration, in the first days of use I already felt a big difference.  After two weeks of using it every day and night, I could see a slight improvement in dark circles as well.  I had no allergic reaction.\n",
      "Line1223: Noticiable hydration since the first use, I recommend to even leave it on over night or during long flights!\n",

      "Line1225: Just started trying out this product recently and am really liking how it’s making my under eyes feel. Very cool and refreshing. Would recommend it to anyone who would like to try it. Of course like always before buying the original, I would buy the travel size and try it out.\n",
      "Line1226: Amazing product’ love the texture. The gel to water consistency works wonders and doesn’t make you feel like you are tugging on the delicate eye skin. I normally have dry skin around my eyes but this product really keep my eyes bright and moisturized!\n",

I believe it is intended for fine lines/wrinkles which i do not have any of currently, so I am unsure how it will benefit those that do or if it is truly worth the money at that price point. I do feel that the moisturizing qualities will definitely help in the prevention of them though. I would recommend.\n",

      "Line1301: This eye bomb cream is amazing. Scent is amazing and it’s super gentle for your delicate eye skin. So important to use an eye cream as opposed to just Lathering on a regular face cream on your eye lids and creases. This stuff is amazing\n",

Still love the product!\n",
      "Line1308: This is a great eye cream for added hydration. It’s super moisturizing yet not too heavy. It’s more of a gel texture rather than cream which is great for the under eye area as heavy creams often cause malia for me.\n",
      "Line1309: Wish it was more cooling and better for puffy eyes but pretty good for dark circles smells nice\n",
      "Line1310: I used to absolutely love this. I have very dry skin so I would apply this to stop my skin from flaking. Unfortunately, I developed a reaction to this product severe enough to require medical attention, and thus would not try this again.\n",

      "Line1318: This does a great job at keeping my under eyes moisturized but i wish it didnt have fragrance in it with my sensitive skin.\n",
      "Line1319: I love how hydrating this makes my eyes look. It makes my eyes look full and not sunken and tired looking. It doesn't irritate my eye bags and also doesn't move while I'm sleeping. I would consider this average priced for an eye cream. Maybe it could have less fragrance in it for people with more sensitive skin?\n",

      "Line1325: This eye cream is so moisturizing, it’s insane. It’s balmy texture helps seal the moisture in all night or day long. It’s not the cheapest eye cream out there, but a little goes a long way so the jar will last you. This is a must have!\n",
      "Line1326: I absolutely LOVE this eye cream, it does everyrhing it claims. As soon as you apply it you instantly feep hydrated, it's not sticky at all and wear great with any concealer. I would most definitely recommend this to anyone who's searching for a great eye cream.\n",

      "Line1330: I don’t really wear eye creams, but Influenster sent me a sample to try. This isn’t very heavy or fragranced. It isn’t greasy, instead it dries like water. I haven’t noticed any milia as a result of using this. I’m only rating it 4 stars because I don’t have any comparison for this type of product, but I have found this to be very hydrating.\n",
      "Line1331: One of my favorite eye creams, especially for when my undereyes need a little extra hydration.  Smooth texture applies comfortably without feeling heavy on undereye skin and keeps undereyes from looking or feeling dry!  I’ve been using this for months (I bought it w my own money before receiving the sample) and it’s still my go-to\n",
      "Line1332: Very lush, creamy moisturizing cream. I used this over a few months and did notice my eyes were much more moisturized. The reason I only gave it three starts is because it is very scented. In the past, scents have not bothered me but this was very strong and I think I may have had a slight reaction to it. I'm not sure if the moisturizing effects of the cream left my eyes puffy or it was a reaction from my body not liking the scent. Overall though, if you like a rich eye cream and don't mind scents in skincare - give it a try. I would recommend: especially in winter or dry environments with low humidity.\n",
      "Line1333: I like it. I think it’s a really great day moisturizing eye cream. I love the way it feels and it’s hydrating for the under eyes.  I love the way it smells and it feels great, all you need is a little bit and it will last a long time! I think this is a great eye cream on the hydrating side- not so sure how it is for wrinkles as it is described. I don’t feel or see a difference with wrinkles so at night, I would go for a retinol based eye creams if you are looking for that. Love it for the hydration though!\n",
      "Line1334: It is such a great eye cream! One of my favorites. It feels so nice and makes my under eyes look and feel smooth!\n",
      "Line1335: By far my favorite eye cream! Extremely moisturizing and light. It doesn’t feel like it’s clogging my pours and my eyes look brighter just after a few uses. I apply it to this around my eyes and even on the lines of my smile. Will be repurchasing!\n",
      "Line1336: I love this product!! Usually eye creams leave texture on my face but this one is so lightweight it won’t clog your pores, or atleast it hasn’t with me! All the tiny bumps are gone and my under eye is so hydrated!\n",
      "Line1337: Okay, call me crazy but I’ve been using this on my whole face for the past week and it has changed my skin texture. (I heard Beyoncé’s makeup artist uses eye cream on the whole face so I had to try it). My pores are tighter, I feel like my skin looks younger and so fresh, and the product is so satisfying to apply- light, soaks in well, and smells great. 10/10\n",
      "Line1338: Got this as a sample and I love it!!!! It’s super light weight and actually hydrated your under eyes!!! I love it and I will purchase it!! I will highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good eye moisturizer.\n",

I can’t wait to continue using it even after my samples runs out!!! #belifinhydration #springintosummervoxbox\n",
      "Line1341: I received this complimentary from Influenster to try out. Honestly, I’m not really into eye creams because I feel like a lot of them feel either heavy or leave a sticky residue, but this one doesn’t!! It’s super light weight and gets absorbed into your skin and doesn’t leave a residue on your skin which I really liked. It is hydrating and moisturizing.\n",
      "Line1342: I received this as a complimentary item from influenster. This is a lightweight yet moisturizing eye cream. It is a bit pricey but has helped me soooo much with my dark circles and i’m not big on eye creams but this is a game changer! I rate it a 4 because i think its pricey compared to other eye creams but other than that it’s worth it!\n",

      "Line1347: I just received this product from Influenster and I have been using it for 2 days now so I can’t really do a review just yet! BUT I love that you don’t have to really use much and it’s so moist! I would buy if my results turn out good!\n",

      "Line1349: This eye cream is lovely! It's hydrating and beneficial for the under eye areas. It seems thick at first, but it does spread nicely. The packaging is amazing and it's gentle. It didn't feel harsh at all. I can recommend this to others since I'm quite impressed.\n",
      "Line1350: Es uno de mis contornos favoritos, tiene una textura especial. Hidrata perfectamente y sobre todo no deja exceso de producto.\n",
      "Line1351: This eye cream is very light, and like a gel texture. I don’t use it everyday, i did every other day.   I was scared to try it because people said it gave them white bumps under their eyes, but that didn't happen for me. I used small amounts.  I would give it a try.\n",
      "Line1352: Producto de buena calidad y buen estado es perfecto para todo tipo de piel super lindo para cuidado de la piel\n",
      "Line1353: I saw a great difference in my dark circles after using this product. It is very effective and I was told that it increases blood circulation around the eyes, which is good. I wanted to refill on this product but it was sold out at Sephora. Waiting for them to restock!\n",
      "Line1354: It’s really good omg I can see the work it’s done for my dark circles and it really works. I also really love how good it smells. Another thing is that a little goes a long way with this product but I do really enjoy it.\n",
      "Line1355: Good eye cream but less efficacy than I expected. It is a cream but I did not realized great changement after some weeks. I think maybe adds some vitamins or other collageneous components could improve it. I used the other products from the same line, and I liked more.\n",
      "Line1356: Me gustaría probarlo, ya que tiene muy buenos comentarios, pero ¿sirve para las personas que tenemos piel grasa?\n",
      "Line1357: Love this, I use it along with the full face moisturizer. I put it not only under my eyes but around my mouth where my skin is extra thin and sensitive as well. As a 26 year old Im doing my best to prevent any more fine lines and wrinkles, hoping to age gracefully and naturally into my thirties.\n",
      "Line1358: I love this Product !!! It’s such a gentle moisturizer on your eye and it leaves it smooth and soft. I wouldn’t touch a think on this product, I think it’s perfect. I would buy it again. Most definitely!!!\n",

      "Line1363: Very hydrating and de-puffs the under eye area. It didn’t help much with my dark circles though.\n",
      "Line1364: I have tried a lot of eye creams and can say that this is the best! worth the price. Very nice texture and moisturizing factors. Nice packaging. Perfect for first \"adult\" eye cream (after 23), for first lines.\n",
      "Line1365: This is super moisturizing but i only use it when i gey eczema around my eyes - it definitely does what the description says but i really need more from an eye cream than just hydratoon\n",

      "Line1378: This is a nice moisturizing eye cream! I do find it a bit too much for during the day, but it is a nice one to use at night! I am not the biggest fan about how this has fragrance though. I do find it can sometimes burn the skin around my eyes.\n",

      "Line1407: I liked this. The texture was nice, and the scent did not bother me. Sometimes products have too much perfume, and I feel this one did not.\n",
      "Line1408: I think this is my best eye cream ever l used it every day at night it makes you feel better when you put it so l recommended\n",
      "Line1409: I really enjoy this eye cream. I don’t feel like it does anything for anti aging or discoloration but hydration is a win! I used to get little bits of texture around the top of my nose and around my eyes from dry skin and this helps it look more smooth and moisturized\n",
      "Line1410: this was not outright bad, but I have plenty of products that I prefer over this. I do not think that it was hydrating and moisturizing enough for me. It would be great on someone who had less dry of skin than I do.\n",
      "Line1411: I have been obsessed with this line from belief! The aqua bombs are perfect for any skin type! I thought that the belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb would be too much for my skin when my friend with very dry skin and eczema recommended it to me! But wow was I surprised, it is water based which doesn’t break out my oily combination skin! Highly highly recommend!!\n",
      "Line1412: I really love this eye cream. It’s creamy and hydrating and has a nice light scent that didn’t irritate my eye area. I alternate between using this around my eyes and the fresh rose cream which I use as an eye cream instead of all over face moisturizer\n",
      "Line1413: I got a free sample but I don’t see any difference or maybe it’s just me. Not a product I would buy\n",
      "Line1414: I love it it’s good my eyes look great so I don’t know what to say￼ So I’ll pick it up I guess\n",
      "Line1415: This eye creme is great and cooling . I do need a little bit more hydration so I didn’t repurchase but if you have oily skin I definitely would try it.\n",
      "Line1416: It’s a very simple yet hydrating eye cream. Packaging is nice but it can irritate those with sensitive under eye areas. If you are prone to irritations I would avoid using this eye cream and go for something  with clean ingredients.\n",
      "Line1417: I really love this eye cream. It’s creamy and hydrating and has a nice light scent that didn’t irritate my eye area. I alternate between using this around my eyes and the fresh rose cream which I use as an eye cream instead of all over face moisturizer\n",
      "Line1418: This is such a great eye cream. I especially love to use it before makeup application because it plumps up the skin beautifully and adds a layer of hydration but without leaving a film under the eyes. Makeup goes on top beautifully and doesn’t cake, crunch or bunch!\n",
      "Line1419: I loved this product I bought the whole set and honestly the best eye cream I have ever tried in a long time doesn’t leave your under eye greasy and actually really works I seen a difference with my under eye appearance after 2 weeks just ordered another one from Sephora !\n",
      "Line1420: I've been trying out a sample of this for a few weeks and NEED to buy the full size. It is so hydrating. My under eye area has never looked better. When I powder my concealer it doesn't look as crepe-y as it did before.\n",
      "Line1421: I received this product in the iPSY glow up set that I received today! I keep it in my beauty fridge, and it feels nice and cool around my eyes. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a great moisturizing eye cream!\n",
      "Line1422: overall was a good eye gel. calmed down puffy eyes in the morning and was hydrating. please take the fragrance out and it would be a dream!!!\n",
      "Line1423: I received the deluxe size as a gift. I love it! It takes such a tiny amount to do its magic. I will definitely get the full size next month.  I now use this twice a day. It takes just barely any product that it lasts. It seems expensive but you replace it so infrequently that it will cost less in the long run!\n",
      "Line1424: This is one of my favorite eye creams! It’s hydrating and minimizes the appearance of puffiness under my eyes! I really like this product.\n",
      "Line1425: I love this product so much!!! this is an eye balm that instantly melts into your skin. i have a sample because its too expensive for me to buy so when i run out of sample i will have to find a new sample. but i love the consistaciy and theres no smell to the product.\n",
      "Line1426: I got this eye cream in an Ipsy bag. After first use, it left my eyes feeling fully hydrated and refreshed. It has a slight fragrance to it, but it’s not overwhelming. The product is expensive so I haven’t repurchased yet.\n",
      "Line1427: Wonderful eye cream!! The skin around my eyes is more on the normal side, but also sensitive and it just soaks up this cream. It’s so hydrating and I love using it at night, and will keep repurchasing.\n",
      "Line1428: Super lightweight. I use this under my moisturizer because my moisturizer is a thicker cream and it works wonders.\n",
      "Line1429: I like this brand but this was a big miss. Most reviews I read are positive so it could be just me, but I found it very greasy\n",
      "Line1430: I love the dewy affect this gives the eye. It brightens the skin around the eye with just hydration alone. For the really dry months I have to use something thicker but otherwise this is a wonderful day to day eye cream.\n",
      "Line1431: It so refreshing and moisturizing but doesn’t make under eye hydrating for long. It’s identical with Peter  Thomas Root cloud hyaluronic cream.\n",
      "Line1432: Love this eye bomb for before bed! It’s calming and cooling and makes my under eyes feel really hydrated. I alternate between this and the ordinary caffeine solution which I prefer more for everyday but I love this product at night.\n",
      "Line1433: i tried a sample of this and it worked okay. i didn’t really notice a huge difference and i probably wouldn’t purchase the full size\n",
      "Line1434: I give this a three. It works great however dissapointed in the fact that there is fragrance in this product\n",
      "Line1435: I like this cream for the eye contour since its technology makes it penetrate much faster and therefore it will have a faster action that translates to having the area well hydrated to prevent premature wrinkles\n",
      "Line1436: loveeee. if you have dry under eyes you need this. i’m 19 and i don’t have much under eye circles or darkness so this eye product is perfect for me because it moistures my under eyes and makes my skin look so smooth and flawless. my makeup applies so much better and doesn’t cake up under my eyes because of this product! it is pricy but the product contains more product than most other eye creams do.\n",
      "Line1437: People say this thing don’t work. Might be true BUT it feels so good under the eyes. Gentle enough and doesn’t sting the skin around your eyes. Has a calming effect when you put it on. Scent is good. Clean n fresh.\n",
      "Line1438: I am obsessed with this eye bomb! I struggle with dark, sunken-in eyes and this really makes them look alive! Steer clear, however, if you don’t like tingling. Otherwise, it works perfect for sensitive eyes. I will definitely be repurchasing the product again and again!\n",
      "Line1439: It does what it says, moisturize. I have problems with dark circles so this product didn’t help with that. It’s like the aqua bomb but a lot thicker consistency. I think it helped brighten up my lower area a little bit. It’s not way too thick consistency and absorbs well into the skin.\n",
      "Line1440: I don’t know how this product works on its own! I have always used it with the full belif kit. Like the water essence, moisturizer, sleeping mask and all. So with all this it’s pretty good!\n",
      "Line1441: Love this eye cream. It’s the same texture as the aqua bomb, making my under eye area hydrated. It helps reduce my dark circles and puffiness. Definitely worth the price! I will buy it again for sure!!! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line1442: I got this in my Ipsy bag and I am really impressed. This eye cream is very hydrating. It also smells good.\n",
      "Line1443: Very good for dry under eyes, it doesn’t do anything for dark circles but it does hydrate and plump you under eyes. Works well under makeup.\n",
      "Line1444: I received this in my topbox augest 2019 and i finished this product may 2 2020 you only need alittle bit it definitely works well to snooth out lines and keep eyes moisturized i have always enjoyed the belief brand i have very sensitive skin and i have not had any issues with any of their products i definitely reccomend it\n",
      "Line1445: Very nice eye cream. It keeps the under eye moisturized but isn’t greasy or heavy. Absorbs quickly and works well under makeup.\n",
      "Line1446: This product feels so refreshing on the eyes. It is very effective at getting rid of your tired, puffy look and is cooling. The only way I would improve thia broduct is if it had a lifting agent in it, but I love it just how it is. It's fragrance free and great for sensitive skin. No harsh fragrance or chemicals! Message me if interested in the product as I am an Avon representative. ❤\n",
      "Line1447: LOVE this eye cream! It's the best for instant moisture (works wonders for winter in Colorado). It absorbs instantly and leaves under eye hydrated all day. Seriously. Buy this product.   belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line1448: I got this first in my Ipsy Bag a few months back and I fell in love and had to go buy a full-size one. I’m gonna be 37 in July and I worry about my under eye creases especially when I smile. I put this on before I go to sleep and it helps so much￼\n",
      "Line1449: I really don’t ever notice a difference with eye creams so i wouldn’t recommend buying it. I got it with a Christmas bundle it’s nice not irritating but wouldn’t spend money on it\n",
      "Line1450: I have genetic dark circles but this keeps them on the bright side. It did meet my expectations. This product is a little on the expensive side and the packaging is so cute. I’d recommend it to others.\n",
      "Line1451: I use this before I go to sleep. I keep in chilled and helps with my puffiness under my eyes.\n",
      "Line1452: I love love love this product! It is super hydrating (I only use it at night before going to bed) and helps with my dark circles in the morning when I wake up. A little bit goes a long way, so this product lasts a long time. I keep it in my skincare fridge to make it extra refreshing when I put it on!\n",
      "Line1453: This is a great eye cream! After using, I noticed that my skin felt soft. My eyes were no longer puffy and I saw a reduction in the color of my dark circles. As time goes on using this, I am certain that I will see improvement!\n",
      "Line1454: This is great stuff. I am exposed to a lot of sun. This is hydrating. I wish it lasted longer. It gives me a quick boost, but I have to re-apply quite often. It does improve the look of aging.\n",
      "Line1455: I received this product in a Sephora Play box and have been using it for about three weeks now. I don't see any difference on my eyes to be honest but I will say that it goes great under my concealer/make-up! It does not get rid of my dark circles (I use the cream AM/PM) and it doesn't build up under your eye or crease so that's nice- but it really hasn't done anything else. Looking for other eye-cream recommendations specifically for dark circles/bags!\n",
      "Line1456: I absolutely love this eye cream!! It is so hydrating and very gentle. My eyes are definitely less dry since using this product!!\n",
      "Line1457: The Moisturizing Eye Bomb is such a beautiful eye cream. It adds great moisture to the skin around the eye without being greasy or oily. I’ve purchased this a few times and it never disappoints. I prefer to use in the daytime when I’m on the go. The only reason it doesn’t get 5 stars is because I have an eye cream that I love just a bit more!\n",
      "Line1458: Such a hydrating eye cream! Helps allow my concealer to be applied evenly with a flawless finish\n",
      "Line1459: I really felt the difference when using this eye cream. It was truly one of the best eye cream I’ve used. I absolutely love BELIF products - their cream and eye creams - but it’s slightly in the higher price range for the amount it provides in the decisive gain big jar packaging.\n",
      "Line1460: This is a very smooth eye cream. It feels very high end. There is a distinct smell, but it doesn’t bother me. Belif products are very stable across the board, you know what you’re going to get. Try it to see how you respond to it.\n",
      "Line1461: I love this. Very hydrating for my super dry under eyes. It isn’t irritating. It’s not meant to help dark circles, but I don’t struggle with those. I mainly struggle with lack of hydration.\n",
      "Line1462: This is a great under eye cream.  I have used quite a few and I keep going back to this.  It helps hydrate and plump up my under eye.   I also noticed that it has lessened my dark under eye circles.  Highly recommend!\n",
      "Line1463: This is great! This product leaves my undereyes moisturized and smooth looking. I would recommend this to everyone.\n",
      "Line1464: really moisturizing. love the consistency and texture of it. no fragrance added and i haven’t noticed any negative reactions on my skin since using it. will continue to use!\n",
      "Line1465: I’m not too picky with eye creams, but this particular one feels SO good going on. It is thick/creamy and you can almost feel it forming your skin.\n",
      "Line1466: The gel-cream consistency is lightweight and easily absorbed, leaving the skin moisturized and keeping my under eye HYDRATED throughout most of the day (I do work 10-hour shifts and wear undereye concealer which can get a bit dry). It has a long list of INGREDIENTS including many plant extracts but is also on the Sephora Clean list. The slight herbal scent is from a natural origin and not artificial. It's barely noticeable but soothing.\n",
      "Line1467: This is my absolute favorite eye cream! The packaging is cute, it applies easily and you only need a little bit. It works amazing, it is super moisturizing, and I recommend this for a good eye cream. It is just awesome!\n",
      "Line1468: I have many problems around the eye I think this product is the best solution to solve my problem I really want to try it I will be happy if I got it valid for everyone and my skin will be really happy because I solved its problem I really hope and very much to get your wonderful and very beautiful product\n",

      "Line1471: i first got this product as a sample from sephora and i loved it so much i went back to buy the full size. the only flaw with this product is the price, it is a little expensive but it works super well. helped bring back moisture to my under eyes\n",
      "Line1472: If you don’t have this product then it’s time to switch. It’s a silky gel-based product. Not much of a smell and it glides on like velvet. I always notice my eyes seeming more dewy and fresh looking. It stays on nicely and doesn’t mess up my concealer at all. I have dryish skin and I live in a dry climate, so it’s perfect for me. That said, it feels a bit heavy when I travel to humid places.\n",
      "Line1473: I love this eye cream because it is lightweight while being moisturizing with a great spa-like scent. It also is a little cooling which is great for under eyes.\n",
      "Line1474: I love the scent this product has! Its consistency is amazing and it is really moisturizing. I will definitely be purchasing more once I finish mine!\n",
      "Line1475: I really like this product, it definitely makes my undereyes less dry. I personally don’t have significant undereye issues but I use this to prevent. It’s a nice consistency and doesn’t have a strong smell.\n",
      "Line1476: SO AMAZING!!  it gives my eyes that \"pop\" of color when I feel like my face looks dull somedays. I use it regularly to maintain my face moisturized because these pasts days it's been drier than normal. The scent is just oh so heavenly too;  a must buy for skincare belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb !\n",
      "Line1477: This is the only eye cream I will use now! I have dark puffy circles and this cream makes my under eyes feel moisturized and cooled\n",
      "Line1478: Tell your dark circles goodbye because this product will tighten, lighten, and soften your under eyes. Up all night studying? No worries take a little smidge of this and dab with your ring finger along your dark circles, it works wonders. Add this to your routine and I swear you’ll see progress!\n",
      "Line1479: This is the best eye cream I have used and actually seen/felt a difference. Back in December 2019, I received three Sephora gift cards for Christmas. I had been wanting to try out some K beauty for a while. I got the set that had this, the cleanser and moisturizer in it. After using it for maybe a week, I could tell a big difference.\n",
      "Line1480: This is a great eye cream for moisturizing. It’s very rich and creamy and leaves the eye area so hydrated. Definitely a favorite.\n",
      "Line1481: I love the jail feels this product the jail seems to just ignore very quickly to my skin and feel very refreshing I really enjoy this product and I would buy it again￼\n",
      "Line1482: This is the best hydrating gel eye cream I have ever used! The texture is smooth and is not irritating! It doesn’t have a smell which is good and this can be found on Ulta or Sephora website! I love love love this!\n",
      "Line1483: This is a great eye moisturizer but I got red dots under my eyes when I used it. I love the moister but the red dots weren’t good.\n",
      "Line1484: Love this eye cream! A little goes a long way. Does not irritate my eyes. So moisturizing! Absorbs quickly.\n",
      "Line1485: A great cream if you are looking for hydration.  Perfect for young skin! ✨ The cream perfectly moisturizes the delicate skin of the eyelids 🥰\n",
      "Line1486: This was pretty good.. I would definitely recommend it for normal/not as dry skin. Because I get eczema on my eyelids I get flaky dry skin and this wasn’t enough since this is a water based solution.\n",
      "Line1487: This eye cream was okay. I need something that does a bit more for my heavy bags. The small sample size did last me quite a long time though!\n",
      "Line1488: It does it's job in terms of hydration but I feel that's only initial; in the beginning of your day. But I didn't see a huge difference under my eyes. I wouldn't purchase again but if you're looking for hydration then this is the one for you.\n",
      "Line1489: It is soooooooooooo great!!!!!!!! I've been using this for over a year and I haven't even run out, it makes my under eyes feel sooo good and it lasts forever too, this is my favorite eye cream and it probably will always be my favorite eye cream.\n",
      "Line1490: This is my all time favorite eye cream. I use it every night! Belif typically makes seasonal packages where you get a full size moisturizer with a deluxe sample cleanser and eye bomb, so I always have my mini bombs handy when traveling. You can feel the cooling moisture immediately upon applying. I wake up everyday looking dewy and refreshed thanks to this amazing eye bomb!!\n",
      "Line1491: MOISTURE!!! Great products to increase moisture under eyes. Love this product and will use forever!\n",

      "Line1494: I’ve never tried an eye cream that has truly left my eye moisturized and feeling extra fresh!\n",
      "Line1495: I really enjoyed this eye cream! It’s a gel consistency but a bit thicker than i was expecting. It does really calm the dark circles but i saw a little milia forming. Only thing was that i didn’t use it for a few months and went back and feel that the gel hardened a little bit\n",
      "Line1496: Hit 27, now think it’s crucial to have an eye cream. This is the first I’ve ever tried, from Topbox. An extremely cooling and soothing cream, my skin immediately look healthier. Only a small dab of ring finger is needed, then touch that with other ring finger and apply under eyes.\n",
      "Line1497: My mother and I, we both are using this product, but for me, personally, this cream has been an irreplaceable product for 2 years. To be honest, I don't have wrinkles around my eyes to tell the difference, but it perfectly moisturizes the skin around the eyes and it is enough to apply a very small amount.\n",
      "Line1498: Great under eye moisturizer.  Very light and no scent to it.  I have very sensitive skin and didn’t cause any irritations!\n",
      "Line1499: really good eye cream! definitely doesn't compare to my favorite Laneige eye cream, but a close second. Has a really nice herbal smell, but could do with more moisture personally.\n",
      "Line1500: Love the belif moisturizing eye bomb. I have been using for quite a while and my skin used to be very dry especially around the eyes. This product has left my eye area looking very hydrated and brightened as well\n",
      "Line1501: I like this eye cream but sometimes the skin under my eyes would feel tight after using this. I ended up switching to a different product that worked better for my skin as i don’t like the tight feeling.\n",

      "Line1503: I got a sample of this eye cream and I finished using it. I liked it a lot. I was very creamy and light weight. It sinks into my skin very fast and moisturize it very well. It does not have any smell. I used it every morning and evening. I liked that even with the makeup on I did not feel anything under my eye. I will buy it again. If you are looking for a new eye cream, do try it.\n",
      "Line1504: I love this product because of how moisturized it leaves my eyes feeling. When I used this product consistently I can even see it helping my dark under eyes. It is a very gentle formula which I love and highly recommend ✅\n",
      "Line1505: This product is incredibly moisturizing. I used this for about a month every night before bed. I found that this made my skin under my eyes to be smoother and plumper while also reducing puffiness. I also thought this product felt very nice on my skin. The hydrating properties in this moisturizer are definitely long lasting and I feel that using this product has changed the texture of my skin under my eyes to be smoother.\n",

      "Line1507: I don’t think it is worth the price. It does what it says and moisturizes but that’s  all the benefits you get it seems. The smell is nice and it feels good going on.\n",

      "Line1511: This product felt really nice and hydrating on my under eye. However when using it under makeup its left greasy with kind of a film. Would recommend for night use only!!\n",
      "Line1512: Super hydrating eye cream, lasts a long time too. I just don’t feel it’s a product that’s changed my life in any way, it’s a pretty basic eye cream\n",

      "Line1517: I love this product. It's moisturizing enough to use at night while being light enough to also wear under my concealer in the mornings (just make sure to give it a few minutes to set!). It also lasts a long time!! I purchased this product in March 2019 and 12 months later I am barely running out despite using it 4-5 times a week\n",
      "Line1518: The only eye cream I have ever tried and don’t plan on ever changing! It really moisturizes the skin around your eyes, it is very helpful when it gets cold.\n",

      "Line1521: I purchased this eye bomb as part of a set￼, so it came in a smaller size, but it was the perfect amount to make me realize I wanted to purchase the full size version! Although I haven’t noticed any kind of a difference as far as dark circles go, it’s extremely moisturizing which gives a much more bright and alive look to my eyes!￼\n",

      "Line1526: I love this product. I got it in a subscription box. It's very effective and very gentle. A little bit of product goes a long way. The very first time I bought an eye cream, it was a very cheap brand and I hated it. It really turned me away from eye creams. But then I got this in a subscription bag and it made me fall in love with eye creams!\n",
      "Line1527: I liked this eye bomb very much. I thought it was quite moisturizing but also light and refreshing. I really enjoyed the way it felt on my skin. It’s a very light formula which was probably my favorite part about it. This cream was also very refreshing and I would recommend it to a friend\n",
      "Line1528: My favorite eye cream!! It’s so moisturizing and it feels really good and refreshing under the eyes. The scent is a slight fresh scent which smells so good and it’s not too much. It’s a gel like moisturizer which I love, and I would definitely repurchase.\n",

      "Line1530: Works amazing. $48 seems like a lot, but this product was honestly worth it and you do see results\n",
      "Line1531: this is the perfect eye cream if your looking to just depuff and moisturize the under eye, you only need a very small amount so it’ll last you a very long time which makes the 48 dollar price tag worth it\n",
      "Line1532: Love this lightweight and hydrating eye cream. Perfect for morning and night, works well under makeup\n",
      "Line1533: Received a travel size and I felt it did hydrate my eyes. It can be pricey for the full size but it’s worth it. Will definitely buy it again. It didn’t feel harsh or tough it was great.\n",
      "Line1534: I got a sample of this as an Ipsy member and it was a bit too watery for me skin. It almost felt like my skin absorbed it immediately. I would recommend a more thicker moisturizer for my skin type\n",
      "Line1535: I got this from my daughter in law in a sample size and I am so happy with it. I had never heard of it and I have super dry skin. So I thought I would try it out. A tiny dab is all you need and it works instantly to make my skin feel very soft and supple. It also lasts all day. My concealer lays down smoother and my eyes look and feel younger. I have severe dryness on the edges of my nose and on the bridge of my nose so I will dab a little on there as well and it's absolutely done wonders! I can't rave about this eye cream enough!\n",
      "Line1536: I can't really tell any difference when I used this because it was only a very small sample. But I like that it doesn't smell at all and easy to apply. Not oily not sticky. It didn't irritate my eyes too. I love that it has cooling effect though it was only in my room not from the fridge. Still, would recommend this to try.\n",
      "Line1537: Love love love love love love this eye cream. I use it every morning and I can totally tell a difference in my under eye area. It helps with bags and makes my skin glow and look vibrant\n",
      "Line1538: This is my all time favorite under eye moisturizer. My under eyes feel so refreshed every time I use it, and I’ve been using this for years. I don’t think I could switch to anything else.\n",
      "Line1539: I got this in a little Ipsy bag once and I’ve never really tried out eye creams but since I received this one I gave it a go and I have enjoyed it. It leaves a little cooling sensation so it leaves like my under eye area feeling new and refreshed\n",
      "Line1540: A very nice light eye cream. It goes well with the aqua bomb moisturizer. You have to be careful to use a little bit so it doesn’t pill up around the eyes. A little goes a long way!\n",
      "Line1541: Man, I wish this product could have worked out better for me. I loved it the first week I used it--the gel texture was so refreshing to my under-eye, and I definitely noticed that my skin was super hydrated! Sadly, after a week of usage, I developed an itchy reaction around my eyes, probably from the fragrance or plant extracts in the formula. Such a bummer, as the feel of the eye cream is really nice! Overall, I would recommend other options on the market over this one.\n",
      "Line1542: I love this eye cream.Super hydrating and has the same great fragrance as the moisturizer.\n",
      "Line1543: This eye cream is amazing! It’s so hydrating & makes your under eyes look so smooth.\n",
      "Line1544: I am obsessed with this eye cream. It feels sooo moisturizing and soft. It works nicely under makeup and doesn’t leave any texture or product.\n",
      "Line1545: Amazing hydration for dry under eyes, my favorite eye cream I’ve ever used! Well worth the money\n",
      "Line1546: This eye cream basically is like giving your under eyes a tall glass of water. It's so hydrating and a little goes a long way. It lasts forever! I wouldn't say it gets rid of dark circles but it does hydrate and fill in fine lines really well!!\n",
      "Line1547: This is a wonderful skincare brand. The price is reasonable and the products perform well and as claimed.  I use the moisturizing bomb at night and pair it with this eye cream.  It’s very lush and hydrating.  It hydrates and moisturizes the delicate skin under my eyes.  It’s also great under concealer.\n",
      "Line1548: It feels really nice on my eyes as it's quite watery and moisturizing.  I don't know how hydrating it is as I have very dry under eye area and I feel that it doesn't do a super great job and hydrating my dry areas.  But I really like how it feels on my eyes.  For the price point, I like it.\n",
      "Line1549: Makes a huge difference with my eyes. They’re hydrating and conditioning. Soo smooth!\n",
      "Line1550: I got a sample of this in one of my boxes. So as always I gave it a try and boy let me say I was happy I did. I always have had a problem with dark circles but after a few days of using this morning & night, I noticed a big difference. My eyes look younger and dont need anymore concealer then normal now! So thank you!\n",
      "Line1551: So far so good. I got this as a Sephora beauty reward mini and I’ve been using it for two weeks and I enjoy its soothing fresh feel and I do see my eyes much more soft and refreshed looking.\n",
      "Line1552: There is an ingredient in here that irritates my eye, even if its just on my lid. If it does happen to get in my eye it hurts like crazy. I prefer Clinque All About Eyes.\n",
      "Line1553: This stuff is amazing. It is so gentle.  I had horribly dry eyelids due to accutane and I was unable to use any type of eye cream except this.  I was able to apply this and the peeling and cracking resolved very quickly.  I have sensitive skin around my eyes and I continue to use this.  Highly recommend.\n",
      "Line1554: Loveeee this eye bomb. Keeps my under eyes so hydrated. I use this at night and sometimes before applying makeup. It is a little pricey but worth it\n",
      "Line1555: While this felt super nice underneath my eyes, I didn’t notice a huge difference. But it was super nourishing and moisturizing for my skin and I really appreciated it! I would maybe recommend to a friend\n",
      "Line1556: Beautiful product. Very refreshing on the eyes and moisturizing. After you apply and dap it in, it will take a few minutes for it to soak into your skin and when it does it is soothing and smooths put your under eyes. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb Definitely recommend this if you are looking for an eye cream. The smell is not weird or fragranced. It smells lovely.\n",
      "Line1557: Got this in my sephora play box. Absolutely loved how lightweight yet so moisturizing it was.\n",
      "Line1558: At 26 I just started using eye cream and this was my first purchase. I’ve been using it for about four months and can say the hydration is amazing! However I notice if I stray too far away from my eye area I develop bumps or pimples. Another reason why I didn’t give it five stars is because I don’t think this product is formulated with the best ingredients compared to other products. Sadly they’re also NOT cruelty free, which I found out a few months after already using the product.\n",
      "Line1559: I received this in a set with other Belif products. I have only used a few times, but it seems to be a hydrating product. I am hesitant on if I need to purchase a full size, but so far I do like the product.\n",
      "Line1560: I absolutely love this eye cream. It helps my dark circles. I put it on at night and when I wake up my eyes are not puffy and feel Amazing.\n",
      "Line1561: La crema me resulta muy agradable, se siente súper hidratante y ligera al aplicarse en el contorno de los ojos, el único inconveniente que el encontraría sería la fragancia (que aunque me resulte agradable, podría ser irritante para personas con pieles muy sensibles)\n",
      "Line1562: This is my favorite eye cream! It’s more of a gel so it doesn’t get too heavy for daytime use and I’ve noticed some improvement in my under eye bags since starting to use it. I’ll continue to purchase this.\n",
      "Line1563: Best eye bomb out there. I have used this since day one and won’t stray away from it since it’s done wonders for my under eyes.\n",
      "Line1564: I love this eye bomb and it has become a staple in my nightly routine. It has a thick consistency and leaves my undereyes feeling super moisturized the next morning. I only wish it wasn’t so expensive but thankfully a little goes a long way!\n",
      "Line1565: I received a sample of this from I think IPSY. I have been using it ever since and have really liked it. The cream is thick and it has lasted a long time. I use it almost every night. I would recommend to others.\n",
      "Line1566: OBSESSED with this eye cream. It smells amazing and goes on super thick!! I use it at night before bed and wake up with smooth under eyes\n",
      "Line1567: This eye cream is super moisturizing. It’s my favorite hands down. I reserve it for when I need extra moisture because it is on the pricey side.\n",
      "Line1568: I love the texture of this eye cream. I store it in a skincare fridge and love how cooling and depuffing it is. It sits well under concealer. Definitely recommend.\n",
      "Line1569: I LOVE belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. I use this whenever I feel like I need an extra moisture boost to my under eye. Its thick but not too thick, it soaks in really nicely and doesn't feel greasy. It makes my skin soft and smooth. It's so effective and I just keep coming back to it.\n",
      "Line1570: A very nice moisturizing eye cream indeed. Nothing too crazy about it. It does what it says it does and I do enjoy it. Wish it had more benefits to it.\n",
      "Line1571: This stuff is great!  I love how it’s like a gel so it absorbs quickly and it feels so good on your skin.  It absorbs quickly also which is a definite bonus\n",
      "Line1572: I ADORE this eye cream as a hydrator. It doesn’t have the bells and whistles of an eye depuffer or retinol cream, but it delivers so much hydration to the undereye area that it often accomplishes the same thing. It’s divine.\n",
      "Line1573: This is one os the best moisturizers that I’ve ever had, instantly my eyes look so healthy and light, no darks around or anything, it’s literally insane. And I also got the small version and it lasts long cause I only need a little bit of it for each eye.\n",
      "Line1574: This is my all time favorite eye cream. I didn't know until very recently that I had dry under eyes, and as soon as I started using this I noticed a HUGE difference. My dark circles started disappearing, makeup didn't burn anymore, and I looked fresh all the time. I absolutely love this product!! I recommend it to everyone - my mom, my friends, my (almost) husband... everyone!\n",
      "Line1575: This is a pretty standard eye cream. Very moisturizing and thick. Nice for the winter.\n",
      "Line1576: I like the texture but I don’t know that I’m getting the results I should be. However I don’t use it nearly as regularly as I should.\n",
      "Line1577: This eye cream is incredible. Will always repurchase. Completely recommend. I am starting to have fine lines around my eyes and this makes them disappear!\n",
      "Line1578: Extremely moisturizing and soothing for long days after work and school.  A little bit goes a long way and my eyes instantly look hydrated and refreshed. This product definitely exceeded my expectations.\n",
      "Line1579: I really liked the slight smell of this, but I didn’t notice any results to write home about. I prefer other eye creams but I did feel hydrated. So it did what it was supposed to. I think my expectations were off.\n",
      "Line1580: Love this eye cream so much!! It’s really rich and a little goes a long way! I love how it makes my eyes look moisturized and soft after waking up! I use this with other belif products and they are magical. Would buy again and again.\n",
      "Line1581: Used this for a few months a few years ago and recently repurchased. I love it! Don’t know why I stopped using but it’s so light weight but super hydrating and works so well under my concealer too!\n",
      "Line1582: I love it as if it were a first for eye shadows and I also apply it in dark circles, it helps to moisturize the area and makes the makeup last longer in this area\n",
      "Line1583: I love this stuff! I feel that it really helps hydrate underneath my eyes. I use it day and night along side my Belif aqua bomb moisturizer at night and my sunscreen for the day.\n",
      "Line1584: A solid hydrating eye cream that does not leave a greasy residue. Smells amazing as well. The only thing that I don’t like about this product is their packaging. I prefer eye creams to be in a squeeze tube or pump packing because it is more hygenic that way.\n",
      "Line1585: This is a great a bomb it’s very hydrating and feels great under the eye to give a cooling and plumbing affect. I like to put this in my refrigerator so it stays really cool and applies like a treatment in the morning to depuff and refresh￼\n",
      "Line1586: Love this stuff! It’s a gel texture so it’s super thin and easy to glide onto the eye area and provide really great moisture\n",
      "Line1587: It’s really moisturizing and it’s not like the essence where it just feels like water. This one is slightly thicker and stays on top of your skin until it gets absorbed and leaves it feeling really soft :)\n",
      "Line1588: This is a decent eye moisturizer - not too thick where you would get milia and not so thin that you don't feel hydrated. This was my first eye cream and while I think there are better out there, how much you love this might depend on what type of skin you have. If you need more hydration, I would skip this!\n",
      "Line1589: I really like this product. It's super light and the texture is similar to a gel. It layers nicely under makeup and it's incredibly mild--no stinging or redness. It also hasn't caused me to have breakouts or bumps under my eyes like some creams have done. I wouldn't say it's super moisturizing, but it's a good product for people with normal or oily skin.\n",
      "Line1590: Love everything about this product. My under eyes were really dry and this product brought them back to life. It’s a light weight cream/gel texture. Very effective and felt refreshing and hydrating on the under eye. No scent and I have bought this numerous times for myself and as a gift. Really great for all skin types and ages.\n",
      "Line1591: My favorite eye cream. Lasts quite a while. Very hydrating. A good value. Just take very good care of it! I once forgot to put the cap back on after using my first one and it dried up and didnt work as well so i had to toss it. 😅\n",
      "Line1592: This product leaves my eye area hydrated for hours. It’s super effective and glides on easy.\n",
      "Line1593: Great night time product for the eyes! Love the belief creams has it is very moisturizing\n",
      "Line1594: I have dry under eyes and concealer makes them look crapey and accentuates the lines, i used this before makeup and my under eyes looked great, very hydrated and smooth! Love the cooling effect this gives, it smells really good too, texture is nice as well.\n",
      "Line1595: This stuff is amazing! I saw immediate changes to my eyes-less lines, less darkness, and healthier skin. It’s so gentle. It’s also super moisturizing but absorbs quickly. It’s become my go to daily eye treatment.\n",
      "Line1596: This eye cream is great for tightening up the under eyes. It’s gentle and smooth to apply. I really like how moisturising it is. Although it doesn’t help much with dark circles it’s still a good eye cream. I would recommend this product.\n",
      "Line1597: Great for moisturizing the eyes. This did give me milia so I have not repurchased. Would work best with dry skin.\n",
      "Line1598: I’ve been using this eye cream at night before bed. It doesn’t really do anything for my skin other than hydrate, but it does that extremely well. I’m using a sample now but I won’t buy more when it’s gone\n",
      "Line1599: Amazing eye cream. Really moisturizes without leaving your skin oily. A little goes a long way.\n",
      "Line1600: This is life changing for dry under eye areas! I was so frustrated with my eye area aging me prematurely by being so dry. This makes my shape tape apply like a dream and my under eyes look hydrated throughout the day\n",
      "Line1601: If you have dry under eyes, you’ll love this. Super moisturizing, thin and soaks in quickly.\n",
      "Line1602: Not sure if it really did anything, but it felt good on my under eyes. Would but again and pay better attention to the after effects.\n",
      "Line1603: I’ve used the belief aqua bomb products before and it always sits nicely on my skin and melts in nicely. It’s soothing makes my skin feel nourished. I used this product on my eyes and out the remainder on my forehead. I then put the belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb on the entirety of my face,neck and any remainder in my chest and hands.\n",
      "Line1604: I personally found that this product wasn't much more effective than any other moisturizer I could apply near my eyes, but having it there to place in my eye area seemed to give me some good hydration. I give it 4 stars because it did make a difference, either because of it's hydrating properties or eye safe qualities!\n",
      "Line1605: Another Ipsy sample and I use this each day. I will purchase a full size. A little goes a long way and the skin of my eyes loves this!\n",
      "Line1606: I love this product. It made my under eyes feel so moisturized and smooth. I will definitely buy this again.\n",
      "Line1607: This eye cream is so refreshing in the morning! It did not disappoint. My eyes are puffy in the morning and this products help cool the under eye area. This is my first time using this product and I highly recommend.\n",
      "Line1608: I like the product but have not noticed any different, very moisturizing, and feels good around the eyes, but some other brands work better for me,will use it up\n",
      "Line1609: I don’t really feel like it does much for me and it does have fragrance which I do not like around my eyes or on my face.\n",
      "Line1610: This was the first eye cream I have ever used and it did not work well for me.  It did not make my dry patches under my eyes go away, but rather it made them worse.  The cream would not blend into my skin, but sit on top of it all day.\n",
      "Line1611: This is a great eye moisturizer. It’s very soothing and soaks right in which is great\n",
      "Line1612: This has been my favorite eye cream so far. I got is as sample in Ipsy and it has lasted me cyclist to a year.\n",
      "Line1613: This does give my eyes the drink of moisture they need, but it is way too heavy to use as a day eye cream. It does take awhile to absorb and can tend to sit on top of my skin for awhile before absorbing\n",
      "Line1614: I don’t think this eye cream is that effective. The full size product has lasted me about 4 months (and I use very generous amounts on twice a day) which is great but I haven’t seen any benefits from using it. I also feel like it pills more often than not which is really annoying.\n",
      "Line1615: Can’t say enough good things about this. It’s super hydrating, light weight, does what it says. This has been a part of my routine for about a year and I love it.\n",
      "Line1616: One of very few eye creams that did not irritate the area under my eye. I got this as a sample to try from a subscription box and was pleased with it. It glides on easily, absorbs well and doesn't leave my under eye feeling greasy or heavy and I really do feel like my undereye area is hydrated when I use it. I would recommend this product.\n",
      "Line1617: I've received lots of sample sizes of this product thanks to belif gift sets, and I enjoy the eye cream. It's hydrating and feels nice under my eyes. It doesn't claim to do a huge amount of things like get rid of bags and wrinkles, so this might not be for you if you're older, but it's a nice product. I don't think I'd go out of my way to buy it, but considering that I don't really use eye cream, that's not saying a lot.\n",
      "Line1618: I actually really love this! This is such a good eye cream, it’s not super heavy feeling under the eyes. So it’s not like a heavy cream. It’s gives you just enough hydration under the eyes to wear during the day for your morning skincare routine. However I found that for night this doesn’t work out for me, I prefer a much thicker eye cream.\n",
      "Line1619: First off the amount you get in the jar is so worth the money it’s crazy. But the produce inside is where you get the value this makes my under eyes so extremely hydrated I take a small amount and pat it in and works amazing under make up. I don’t know notice any benefits other then hydrated but that’s all I wanted when I bought this product.\n",
      "Line1620: Loooove this eye cream! It’s so rich, yet light, it hydrates and helps with lines and darkness, it plumps, and is well worth the price tag!\n",
      "Line1621: This is one of my favorite eye creams I have ever used. I use it both in the morning under makeup and at night. The on downside is that it contains fragrance which I don’t like in my skincare. However, I can look past that since I love the consistency of the product.\n",
      "Line1622: This eye bomb is sort of like a gel cream. It is super hydrating and really smooths out your under eyes. Since using it I’ve definitely noticed that my dark circles have become lighter.\n",
      "Line1623: This is actually a really good eye cream. It’s light and doesn’t cause milia. It absorbs quickly under the eye and leaves the area soft, plump and hydrated. It wears well under makeup too. Long term use does hlep with making fine lines less noticeable.\n",
      "Line1624: This makes my under eyes so hydrated! I cannot get enough! I just wish it came in a pump so I didn’t have to stick my fingers in it!\n",
      "Line1625: I got a trial size in my Ipsy bag and I use this everyday and I can really tell the difference! A little goes such a long way! This product will last you a long time if you let it! 100% recommend!\n",
      "Line1626: Love this!  My under eye never looks as tired as it feels!  I love that a little goes a long way. I use it every morning and have been using it for the last six months. It is also reasonably priced compared to other eye creams.\n",
      "Line1627: Very moisturizing eye creme. Leaves eyes feeling very fresh, and soft. Also some what affordable for an eye creme and is a good size!\n",
      "Line1628: This is a beautiful, lightweight eye cream. I wish it didn't have fragrance which is why I didn't give it five stars. It absorbs quickly and hydrates all day even under concealer and powder, which means my under eyes look better at the end of the day than with other eye creams.\n",
      "Line1629: I absolutely love this eye cream! It smells great and feels amazing on my eyes! It blends into my skin perfectly without leaving my eyes feel greasy or oily.\n",
      "Line1630: While I did not see a significant difference in fine lines and wrinkles, this was an excellent cream to restore moisture to my under eyes. Again, if you’re looking for anti-aging solutions I would get a different eye cream\n",
      "Line1631: I like this moisturizing eye bomb as a little goes a long way. It feels cooling when I apply it and does help my bags look not so puffy. I only have a deluxe sample of this, so I'm sure with prolonged use, I would see better results. I would recommend it to others.\n",
      "Line1632: Expensive but lasts forever (like, over a year!). Very hydrating. Good for night and under makeup. Love the scent!\n",
      "Line1633: Every moisturizing. I love water based moisturizers and eye creams. They are better for oily skin then the creamy ones. I love the smell. Doesn’t burn my eyes but it definitely doesn’t take away my dark circles. It is more for the puffyness\n",
      "Line1634: This is a great go to eye cream. It’s a cooling formula with a light scent and moisturizing results\n",
      "Line1635: I really like how this product hydrates my eyes, totally agree with the name lol, I tried this product because it came in my sephora box and after that I’ve buying it.\n",
      "Line1636: I just love the way this eye cream feels. It is so silly and smooth. I was afraid I was going to go through it quickly, because the sample I received is very small, but a little bit goes a long way. It has a very nice fresh scent to it. It stays true to the claim of hydration!\n",
      "Line1637: This is my favorite eye cream. I love that it smells refreshing and not heavily perfumes. It is very light and the jar lasts a long time. It is extremely effective and does not clog my pores like other eye creams have for me in the past. I consistently buy this eye cream and continue to love it\n",
      "Line1638: This is literally the best eye cream. I think this entire skin care line is great for people who have picky and sensitive skin, because it has not irritating gel moisturizers that soothe the skin. This eye cream in particular is super hydrating while also being lightweight and just amazing. I put this on before I go to bed and when I wake up in the morning, and it keeps my eyes plump and hydrated. It even layers well under makeup. Favorite product\n",
      "Line1639: This stuff is the most hydrating ever! If you have dry skin these are life savers. Try it!\n",
      "Line1640: I received this twice. From an ipsy bag and sephora play. It's not greasy under my eye or near the outer corners of my eye. I basically apple where I see fine lines for my eye. I've noticed less lines under my eyes since it's moisturizing. Definitely worth trying and I'm almost out.\n",
      "Line1641: Such a good eye cream really made my under eyes feel hydrated and plump. Made a huge difference when I applied makeup on my under eyes no more creases from lack of sleep! It fees so light on but makes a big difference I love this stuff actually the whole line is fantastic!\n",
      "Line1642: I got this as a sample and I really love it. Eye creams are super hot or miss for me. I honestly feel like some actually dry out my u set eye, but this one is super moisturizing, and I really enjoy it.\n",
      "Line1643: It’s a good hydrating and moisturizing eye cream👌 nothing extraordinary. Great for all skin types!\n",
      "Line1644: This is an amazing eye cream for the am. It’s got an almost minty feeling when you apply so it really awakens your eyes. Super gentle and you need very little product so a full sized will last you a very long time. Another great Belif product!\n",
      "Line1645: This is the only eye cream that hasn’t irritated my under eyes in any way. A little goes a long way so I think it’s worth paying $34 for. It lasts me months and it keeps my under eye area moisturizer and plump. I’ve purchased this 5x and will continue to do so.\n",
      "Line1646: Super hydrating and refreshing!  I love sticking this in my beauty fridge and putting it on cold to bring down puffy morning eyes.  My eyes are somewhat sensitive and this hasn’t caused me any issues and makeup goes on smoothly over this.  Will continue to purchase.\n",
      "Line1647: Loving this eye balm, it’s so moisturizing and gentle. Goes good under makeup. Will be buying the full size when my sample runs out.\n",
      "Line1648: Best eye cream ever. I have very sensitive eye area and so many eye creams burn the skin around my eyes and make my eyes water. This is very moisturizing, sits well under makeup and doesn't irritate my eyes. 10/10!\n",
      "Line1649: I received this in a sample size so only got to use this product for a short while. But I believe it is worth it's price tag. This reduced the puffiness of my undereyes and I love the cooling effect. It s definitely an eye product worth buying and I would definitely go out and buy the dull size of this item.\n",
      "Line1650: My boyfriend and I both use this eye cream as it is intensely hydrating and does not irritate our sensitive skin. Other than that, I don't think this product will address all of your skincare needs- i.e. reducing the appearance of puffiness or fine lines. Instead, I like to use this over another product so that my concealer doesn't crease.\n",
      "Line1651: I received this in my ipsy bag so I only tried a small size. It was non Irritating and rich in texture. Definitely made my under eyes moisturized without being oily. I would invest in the full size , for sure!\n",
      "Line1652: Pretty good eye cream. The price point is right, the scent is great, and the formula is intensely moisturizing and rich without being irritating or leaving a residue. My eyes look brighter and less creased after using this product. Also this brand is one of the best out there.\n",
      "Line1653: I only tried a small trial size of this, but I love it. I’m currently using it. I know it’s quite pricey. I’m still contemplating if it’s worth the price. Over all it is a great product very hydrating\n",
      "Line1654: This stuff is incredible and makes me feel like my eyes aren’t dry at all! I have very dry eye corners, and this almost helps to heal that as well. It doesn’t have a strong scent, which I also appreciate.\n",
      "Line1655: Nice moisturizer for under eye but I didn’t see anything else. If you expect a bit more from your eye cream go for something else\n",
      "Line1656: This is one of the best eyecreams on the market. It delivers, hydrates, diminishes puffiness, helps reduce fine lines. I love the packaging, the scent. I would use it forever\n",
      "Line1657: Not a fan unfortunately. I used this a few years ago and it made my under eye area sting and tried this again last month and it gradually made it sting. Idk what’s in this stuff but it’s...completely useless to me.\n",
      "Line1658: This is another favorite of mine from this brand. I can't say there's anything from this brand that I don't like. This eye cream is hydrating for my under eye area and I can see a difference when I don't use it. This spreads very nicely, and is not heavy. It has no scent which is always a plus. This lasts forever. One won't be disappointed if they decide to purchase.\n",
      "Line1659: I received a sample of this as a pint perm at Sephora and it has lasted such a long time. You just need a tiny bit, so it goes a long way for what you get. It doesn’t tingle like some eye creams can do. It moisturizers, but not too much that I feel like I can’t use it in the mornings as well.\n",
      "Line1660: I like this gel eye cream. It feels soothing and cool on your skin. It’s not my favorite brand but I like it.\n",

      "Line1666: This is a really nice eye cream. It has an emollient texture on the thicker side that works nicely to plump fine lines for mature skin. It’s great under makeup, so a perfect choice for a daytime skin care routine. But most people will find it rich enough for nighttime, too. It’s sort of the Goldilocks of eye creams for me: Just right.\n",
      "Line1667: This is soooo great! My favorite eye cream! It is super moisturizing and great during the winter months. Not too thick where it weighs down your eyes, but no too thin where it seems like it’s doing nothing. I really love this product and it is definitely worth the splurge. I absolutely love it!! :))\n",
      "Line1668: This smells so amazing I want to rub it all over my body but......... it makes my eyes water after it put it on. I’m very careful not to get it in my eyes but they still water... it must be something in the formula that my eyes don’t agree with.\n",
      "Line1669: This is so nice around the eyes, keeping them hydrated and refreshed while combatting darkness and puffiness.\n",
      "Line1670: This is hands down my current favorite obsession for the past 2 months. The consistency is beyond perfect! It feels so good on the eyes. Doesn’t burn or irritate. Really hydrates the eyes and it’s perfect for prepping the eyes before makeup. And it smells amazinnngggg!!!!\n",
      "Line1671: I got this sample from Ipsy and I’m in love with it. It goes on so smooth and it smells so good. I use it day and night. I’ve noticed that when I wear it under my make concealer it helps it stay longer! This cream is not cheap but I’m definitely buying the regular size.\n",
      "Line1672: I have really sensitive under eyes but this product is really gentle and hydrating.  I like it a lot to use in the morning time to help with any puffiness and dryness that can happen overnight.  It also helped to ease the small bumps I was getting under my eye.\n",
      "Line1673: Has a very nice cooling affect. Perfect for those who have puffiness under eye. Hydrating and very soothing.\n",
      "Line1674: I have never really found an eye cream I liked before this because I felt like they were all too heavy, but this one is perfect. It's moisturizing and hydrating without feeling oily or heavy under the eyes. Use it every night and in the mornings ad it makes my undereye concealer sit better on my skin.\n",

      "Line1677: I have never used a eye cream like this one. The gel consistency is sooo hydrating and it feels amazing applying it\n",
      "Line1678: The best eye cream! It’s super moisturizing but also sinks in to the skin completely. It makes my eyes look brighter and healthy. A little goes a long way! I’ll be using this for a long time\n",
      "Line1679: This eye cream is great to go along with the Belif Aqua Bomb. It is gentle but moisturizing enough to properly hydrate the under eyes. I feel like it ever so slightly de puffs and feels cooling, which is perfect for the morning. Overall it is a good eye cream and I would repurchase!\n",
      "Line1680: Very hydrating eye mask. Love using it with the other belif products. Doesn’t leave a sticky residue at all. Can’t speak to the effectiveness removing wrinkles etc because i haven’t been using it long enough\n",

      "Line1682: Omg my undereyes are always incredibly parched, and I have tried more eyecreams and eye moisturizers than I can count! The last one that I tried was the Aquabomb. I received it as a sample in a sub box a couple months ago, and it is THE ONE! Gives my undereye area SERIOUS hydration! It is very lightweight, not oily or greasy feeling AT ALL, has almost no scent to it, looks smells and feels very pure and \"organic\" and my skin just soaks it up and loves it! I also have EXTREMELY SENSITIVE skin on my face; even products that advertise as being hypoallergenic, sensitive, etc, will still badly irritate my face..But not the Aquabomb! I would recommend this product to the whole world! And the price is more than affordable as well as SO worth it! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line1683: Works well so far, I have only used a handful of times but so far so good I haven't noticed any major improvements other than it seems a bit more moisturized when I wake up in the AM, but again I just started using this and have zero complaints thus far (:\n",
      "Line1684: I can't really tell if this does anything. I mean, it feels nice going on and I can't say it's making anything WORSE but I don't really notice any difference between using this and just using a regular moisturizer. For the price, I don't think it's worth it, unless you just want to treat yourself.\n",

      "Line1687: An amazing eye cream for under concealer as it is so light weight and moisturizes the under eyes like no other. I have sensitive skin and this product does not burn around my eyes.  One jar lasts months and I will be buying this product again!!\n",
      "Line1688: Got a sample in one of my subscription boxes, and just kinda sat on it until a friend of mine was raving about it. So I finally whipped it out and was blown away. Very light-weight, perfect under makeup, absorbs quickly. Very delicate fragrance that I enjoy sooooo much. Smells the same as their True Cream Aqua Bomb, I love using them together as part of my daytime routine. A little goes a long way so it's a great value.\n",
      "Line1689: Absolute favorite eye cream! It’s so moisturizing and feels so light. I have eczema and I used to get dry patches around my eyes, but since using this the last year, I haven’t experienced any dry patches! I highly recommend.\n",

      "Line1711: I’ve tried many eye creams but I always come back to this one. I’m on my third jar. It gives the best moisture to my eyes without being greasy. It works great under makeup because the hydration seems to plump out some of my fine lines.\n",
      "Line1712: It works just fine. Got it with my beauty insider reward pts. I haven’t quite seen any difference with my eyes.. not that I ever pay much attention to it? The smell is pleasant and not over powering. Don’t want anything too heavy on your eyes and this is that product\n",

      "Line1714: Youtuber told me about this one constantly and i finally saved up for it and it is totally worth it. Every under eye cream has had me have millia over and over and i stopped using for a few months and it went away and was skeptical on trying this. It sinks in right away and give enough hydration that you need. I feel over time it will help with wrinkles as well!\n",

      "Line1720: I think this is a decent eye cream and totally understand why it’s so popular. It’s just not necessarily my favorite.  These days I’m more on the hunt for skincare that has a heavy anti-aging focus, this doesn’t really.  However it is extremely hydrating and applies beautifully.  If that’s all you are needing at this point in time I’d definitely recommend it.\n",

Of you dont like a perfumey scent in your eye cream, I'd stay away from this one. If you dont mind it, it is nice. This leaves my eye area hydrated for quite some time. I like it under my makeup. It really does work great of you need moisture under your eyes.\n",
      "Line1727: Moisture! Moisture! Moisture! My under eye area was Mojave dry and this eye cream saved it. The tub is a pretty blue, I just wish it came with a spatula.

      "Line1735: One of my top 5 favorite eye creams. It is super lightweight for day and night and helps my under eye bags stay plump throughout the day. I love the thin consistency. It produces me with hydration and a smooth base for undereye concealers I have a little baby sample jar that literally lasts forever. A little goes a long way with this product. The scent is very mild. If you’re dry or need help with creasing, I think this is a super helpful product.\n",
      "Line1736: This stuff is super! I think it’s the most noticeably de-puffing of all the eye creams I’ve tried so far. It’s extra moisturizing and it feels super going on, especially when I put it in my skincare fridge first!\n",

      "Line1740: This is a good eye cream but the price is very high. It just hydrates my skin like a basic cream and does not cause any under eye milia, which I do get easily. The amount of product needed isn’t much. This cream does have a scent and it is light and fresh. I have hereditary dark circles that can only be helped with sleep so I am unsure of the effectiveness for dark circles.\n",

      "Line1747: This is pretty good, it is a gel eye cream and feels really hydrating when you apply. I don’t think it’s the most moisturizing eye cream I’ve ever used but it does the job. There are other eye creams that I prefer over this so while I think it’s acceptable, I probably won’t repurchase.\n",

      "Line1756: Truthfully one of, if not, the best eye bomb I’ve used. As the name says, it’s a moisturizing bomb with moisture being the primary goal. I have been struggling with dryness under the eyes which leads to increased lines and wrinkles, puffiness and just heavy looking bags. This has helped combat all of that. The only thing it hasn’t touched on is dark circles which is almost impossible to do being THEYRE genetic. I will continue to repurchase this product\n",

      "Line1773: This stuff is amazing and I can’t believe it’s not as popular as it deserves to be. It removes my dark circles, isn’t slimy feeling on your face and leaves my skin as velvety as the cream when it’s in the jar. Definitely an A+!\n",
      "Line1774: I am on my second jar of this for my nightly eye cream. It does not irritate my eye region at all, and is so great!\n",
      "Line1775: You will be in love with this eye bomb. The texture is amazingly silky and you can feel it absorb and lighten your eyes. A little goes a long way and this stuff lasts forever!\n",
      "Line1776: This is 1 of the best eye creams I have tried so far.  Love all of the products I have tried from Belif. Good moisturizer and soaks right in. I dont have wrinkles or dark circles so cant say how it works for them...\n",
      "Line1777: This eye cream is super hydrating. The skin absorbs the cream immediately. There is almost a cooling sensation from it.\n",
      "Line1778: My eyes are not as puffy and the dark circles and fine lines almost disappered. The smell is great. Helps my makeup go on better.\n",
      "Line1779: SO MUCH SILICONE that after a few days of use it made the wrinkles around my eyes WORSE. It caused my concealer to crease and I couldn't go anywhere near my eyes with powder. It took a couple of weeks to eliminate the dryness and my skin never really recovered from the wrinkles. DO YOUR RESEARCH and avoid silicones around your eyes! They form an occlusive barrier and dry you out!\n",
      "Line1780: Perfect to use under your eyes to keep that area moist and hydrated! Super light weight and you can use during the day and right before you sleep. Does not leave your skin sticky but this is not water base like how the sleeping mask is.\n",
      "Line1781: Tied for my favorite eye cream.  Need such a small amount and eye area feels amazing and moisturized.  Highly recommend.\n",
      "Line1782: I was hesitant when I first heard of this, for the price I was iffy. But man this changed the game for me. My under eyes are so moisturized and soft I couldn’t belif it. I’ve bought a few bottles and will continue repurchasing.\n",
      "Line1783: I've received this undereye moisturizer probably a dozen times from different subscription boxes and I'm a fan! I use it on both the undereye and lid areas before bed and before applying makeup and it keeps those areas from feeling dry and helps under eye makeup apply smoothly. I'd recommend you give it a try!\n",
      "Line1784: For the amount of product and the price, I feel like this is a good value. I did think that it moisturized my skin well but I did not notice a difference with elasticity. I usually prefer eye creams that also brighten and minimized wrinkles, so I don't think I will be repurchasing this. If you are only looking for something that is moisturizing though, it is a good product.\n",
      "Line1785: this  product moisturizing skin under eye very good💙                                                                      its very effective dor my  dry skin.    i recomend it\n",
      "Line1786: This is an amazing eye gel.  Absorbs quickly, restores moisture quickly and does the dishes when it's done.  Ok, maybe not the dishes, but it does the job and then some.  It's one of my absolute favorites and I highly recommend this product to others.\n",
      "Line1787: I love this eye cream so much. I got it as a sample and it was amazing but I couldn’t bring myself to purchase because of the high price tag.\n",
      "Line1788: OMG IT'S SO GOOD. It's honestly so cooling to the eyes. In a good way, it's a light cream that doesn't suffocate the under eyes. In addition to it's post-application cooling effect, it's really hydrating and smells really fresh like some fresh grass herb.\n",
      "Line1789: The best combination is this product with the belief moisturizer. My skin has completely transformed since I got it. Recommend this!\n",
      "Line1790: I just started using this.  I received a small version through a subscription box.  It is really lasting a while, which is great as I can judge over a period of time if it is indeed helping.  I have extremely dry under-eyes, so if this helps it will be a miracle worker.\n",
      "Line1791: I usually only get this in sample form because my money goes to the aqua bomb, the moisturizer and the cleanser. HOWEVER: even the littlest jar of this goes a long way and really helps my under eyes. 100/10.\n",
      "Line1792: This stuff is good.  Though I did not see significant improvement, it really does plump up the skin and leaves it hydrated. I would only recommend for nighttime use, as it's too thick/too much for day and could not be worn under makeup. Belif does eye creams well.\n",
      "Line1793: Great brand and a great product. I don’t usually use eye cream/moisturizers but this one is great! It does help with darkness around the eye and gives you a refreshed look. I’d buy it again. And I’d recommend it!\n",
      "Line1794: Wow!! I am in my kid 30’s and have some fine lines under my eyes and crows feet. My left eyes crow is much more noticeable than the right. I’ve been searching for an eye treatment that will plump up those lines for longer than an hour or two. I was immediately impressed with this product!! My skin was soft, moisturizer but not greasy or shiny. My lines appeared filled in 12 hours after applying. Will continue using this for sure\n",
      "Line1795: This is a very moisturizing eye cream while still absorbing quickly. It didn’t do much for dark circles, but that isn’t one of my bigger problems. It is very hydrating but still works well under makeup. I have very sensitive skin under my eyes and this didn’t cause any negative reactions at all.\n",
      "Line1796: Really refreshing cream, keeps my undereye really hydrated and it last a long time. I would like the cream to have less fragance but feels nice on skin\n",
      "Line1797: After trying the moisturizer I had to get their eye cream. It’s pricey but it works well! Saw a movie improvement immediately. It also lasts me a while so I can justify the price. The packaging is a little heavy on the plastic. I would love to see them condense the size of the container.\n",
      "Line1798: A go to eye cream for me.  It is creamy but after it sets into the skin is not greasy and does not separate makeup on the face.  It truly feels so hydrating on the gentle skin around the eyes.  I especially like to use this product at night time but works during the day as well\n",
      "Line1799: This was the first eye cream I have ever used - so I do not have much to compare it to - however I love it! It has a cooling effect that is great for the mornings and leaves my under eyes feeling refreshed. I have noticed slight change over time in the brightness of my under eye area! I think comparable to other brands the price is right as well. Would recommend!\n",
      "Line1800: Amazing eye cream! I often suffer with puffy eyes with dark circles and this cream has helped these issues and absorbed well into the skin! I didn’t experience any breakouts or eye stinging. Plus, the cream is slightly cooling!\n",
      "Line1801: Love this one from belif. Light weight, high moisturizing, fast absorbing - essentials in an eye cream (a side note: I don't expect any of my eye cream to do more than hydration)\n",
      "Line1802: This is literally the bomb when it comes to keeping your under eyes hydrated. I've used this product since it first came out and I will keep repurchasing!\n",
      "Line1803: I wanted to love this SO BADLY, but alas, it was giving me milia too, which is also what I read from other reviews. The light, cooling, and refreshing gel feels absolutely amazing going on, but it also made my lids feel a little too slick during the day - heads up to my oily lid friends.  I don’t have particularly sensitive skin, but when that first clogged follicle/pore showed up on my eyelid margin during the week of using this, I couldn’t continue forward with it.\n",
      "Line1804: Very moisturizing! I usually use this product during the day to moisturize the skin under my eye and prevent creasing!\n",
      "Line1805: I love dabbing this eye cream on before I go to bed. It really helps keep the skin around my eyes moisturized and bright, especially during fun the harsh winter months.\n",
      "Line1806: I really enjoy this eye cream and I’ve been through a whole one so I feel like I truly “know” it, for the price and the amount you get, you can’t beat it. In reality, I don’t think it’s all that special, but that’s kind of what I like too, just something simple that does the job. The only thing I noticed that was negative was that you need to be careful with how much you apply because it can pill up a little bit.\n",
      "Line1807: I got this as an add on from ipsy. I use it daily as an under eye moisturizer. It works very well. I have dry skin and this keeps my under eyes hydrated.\n",
      "Line1808: Definitely very moisturizing like it says but it didn’t do much for my dark eyes; and as a mom; I definitely need an eye dream that will help me not look like a mom who hasn’t slept in 2 years. If your eyelids/eye area is dry, this is a good eye cream; but if you’re looking for something to help dark circles, this isn’t it.\n",
      "Line1809: I usually wake up with bags under my eyes. Not with this under eye cream. It goes on light and absorbs well into my skin. 10 /10 would recommend.\n",
      "Line1810: Got a sample size in one of my subscription boxes. It is a nice under eye moisturizer. My biggest skin concern is dryness, but usually my moisturizer does good job as well.\n",
      "Line1811: Got this as a sample in an ipsy bag and fell in love with it. A little goes a long way and it definitely keeps my eye area hydrated in winter. I would recommend anyone with dry skin try this in the 5mL version before committing to the larger version as that bottle lasted me 6months\n",
      "Line1812: This eye cream delivers rich, potent moisture without feeling greasy, and a little bit goes a long way. It also did not irritate my sensitive skin. This product is well worth the money.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line1813: Got a sample of this and only used it 2 times now. I’m starting to get into eye creams and this is the first product that I was able to try. This smells wonderful just like the aqua bomb. It does a great job at moisturizing my under eyes which is why I’m thinking about purchasing the full size.\n",
      "Line1814: Super hydrating eye cream. Lightweight formula smooths under eye wrinkles and gives a healthier, more awake look to the eyes. Super gentle and safe for all skin types. Ideal for any clients looking for a little under eye pick me up!\n",
      "Line1815: One of my faves! Purchased full-size and has a lot of product! My under eyes are not crepey when I wear my makeup and I do think this has helped retain the moisture. It’s pricey but I’d recommend. Skincare is worth the markup whereas makeup is not necessarily, I am loving my drugstore over my high end makeup products.\n",
      "Line1816: This eye cream is pretty decent. I don’t think there is much to write home about aside from it being moisturizing but it does exactly just that, moisturize. This didn’t help my dark circles but it did make my under eye area a lot more moisturized.\n",
      "Line1817: Absolute best eye cream! Not sticky, lays perfectly under makeup, and absolutely worth the higher price point!\n",
      "Line1818: I love this moisturizing eye bomb! It immediately made my eyelids feel so hydrated and the hydration lasts all day and night\n",
      "Line1819: I've been using this eye cream for 3 years now and absolutely love it!!  Super moisturizing and great to use in the morning under concealer.  [product:belif-moisturizing-eye-bomb]\n",
      "Line1820: This stuff is amazing! Not greasy super hydrating. It smells and feels nice my only complaint is that it’s a little pricey but a little goes a long way so it’s worth it\n",
      "Line1821: Very moisturizing but is no better than the moisturizing cream from Belif. I’d recommend just getting that and putting a little extra around your eyes\n",
      "Line1822: The best eye cream for extremely dry eye area. I use it in the dry and frigid winter months - it is the only thing that works for me in the windy depths of northeast winter. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Line1823: Amazing. Love the smell. Formula is great, and effective. A little pricey, but worth it.\n",
      "Line1824: Talk about moisturizing!!! I LOVE this product! As a teacher, I feel like I always have tired eyes and when I put this on - it gives life back to my under eyes 😍\n",
      "Line1825: Fantastic eye cream! This cream is refreshing and just thick enough for nighttime wear. I love to apply this and watch my eye area look instantly brighter.\n",
      "Line1826: Really want to love it seeing how a lot of people hype about it. But it doesn’t work for me for some reason, I applied it at night and I tried to even put a lot more on to see if it actually made a difference. Sadly no, my eyes weren’t moisturizing, pretty dry in fact.\n",
      "Line1827: I love all of the belif products. You just need a little dab of it and man does it work. I have dry skin and use it 2x a week.\n",
      "Line1828: This is the most hydrating eye mask you can find. I use it morning and night. It’s amazing!\n",
      "Line1829: Received this in my ipsy bag.   I find it to be light and works pretty well to keep my under eye area moisturized throughout the day.  It has a nice lemony scent that while strong is not unpleasant.  I would definitely purchase this again.\n",
      "Line1830: This eye cream is very moisturizing and a good de puffer! I like to use it at night before bed to avoid puffy eyes in the morning! My only critique is that it is on the more expensive side. I highly recommend if you want to splurge.\n",

      "Line1841: After getting this as a sample from ipsy, I fell in love. This is my everyday morning and night eye cream now, replaced by a retinol twice a week.\n",
      "Line1842: This product is super hydrating and great for under eyes! I didn’t notice a huge change in the appearance of fine lines, but my skin felt well moisturized. It was gentle and seemed to soak into my skin.\n",
      "Line1843: Best eye cream ever! Leaves the driest skin feeling moisturized!! I love for this stuff\n",
      "Line1844: Probably the most hydrating eye cream you can get! Love this stuff and love the smell\n",
      "Line1845: Great day eye moisturizer! It works really well with or without makeup. It adds great hydration and smooths the under eye. Its still not as comparable to some night eye creams but it’s perfect for day use. Also the size of the container is huge! 25ml the standard is usually 15ml. Love it!\n",
      "Line1846: This product is small but mighty! I have terrible dry under eyes and I noticed when I used this my concealer and powder (to set) applied so much nicer the next day! I usually apply this at night to receive the maximum benefits.\n",
      "Line1847: This was an okay eye cream, I had heard so many great things about it, I think I was expecting more. I didn't see what the hype was all about. I think it's an over priced eye cream.\n",
      "Line1848: I love this product. It definitely helped with the puffiness around my eyes. It feels great, very light and doesn't make your eyes feel heavy.\n",
      "Line1849: I love this eye cream. It’s my new fav. I feel like I saw a difference after a couple uses\n",
      "Line1850: This eye cream was very hydrating and not to heavy under my eyes. There was no scent and did not irritate under my eyes. I never noticed any huge improvement with my under eyes and I think that it was overpriced. I think that belif has much better products than this eye cream\n",
      "Line1851: It’s like adding gallons of water under your eyes. I always find that I wake up very refreshed and and hydrated specially if I’m going to use a dry concealer like shape tape\n",
      "Line1852: So far I am liking the product but I don’t know long term how effective it has been. My under eyes aren’t as dry as they were, but I feel that throughout the day it wears off relatively quickly compared to other eye creams in this price range.\n",
      "Line1853: Really bomb,works well, smooth, love smell, not bothering, good value, good over night, would recomend,i get it in ipsy and love it\n",
      "Line1854: Great eye cream for super hydration. Does not irritate my sensitive eyes at all. I've purchased one jar so far and it seems to have no end to the jar.\n",
      "Line1855: I have young sceen and right now my under eye skin doesn’t need special care, but for future to avoid wrinkles and fine lines I started to moisturize them. I like Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. Right now I am happy to using it.\n",
      "Line1856: Wow! This is an eye gel that I find myself reaching for every night. It is a nice texture, moisturizes great, and has a good smell. I apply this every night and sometimes before I apply make up. It has kept my under eyes hydrated and looking youthful! Love this!\n",
      "Line1857: I recently received this in my Ipsy bag and omg. Best eye cream for under makeup ever! It absorbs quickly making my concealer just glide under my eyes. The eye area feels plump and soft and moisturized. Even my concealer won't crease as much when I use this. I feel this is good for night time use although I like my night eye creams to be more heavy.\n",
      "Line1858: Love the smell of this product. It’s great for nighttime use and helps me wake up looking more refreshed and less tired. A little bit goes a long way. So while the container may be small, it should last you a while.\n",
      "Line1859: I have such sensitive eyes and there have been creams I love the result of, but they make my eyes burn or cause milia bumps. This cream is light, but still very hydrating. It absorbs quickly which is great especially for wearing makeup. I noticed a difference in the hydration of my under eyes within 3-4 days of using morning and night.\n",
      "Line1860: This is a slightly thick eye moisturizer so it’s best to be used at nighttime but it can work during the day if you’re not planning on applying makeup right away. It’s super moisturizing and cool to the skin.\n",
      "Line1861: It feels very light on skin, it has a nice scent. It leaves my under eye feeling cool for some reason, I recommend this product if you’re on your 20’s\n",
      "Line1862: This is a pretty good eye cream. It had the same signature scent of the aqua bomb. I apply a thin layer all over my under eye and lid every night before bed. It definitely moisturizes but I’m not 100% sure about what’s it’s doing for me. But the best methods of skincare are preventative!\n",
      "Line1863: This eye cream is super hydrating under the eyes. You use so little that it a great value. I love the gel water texture and my skin absorbed it so well and the eye remains hydrated all day.\n",
      "Line1864: This is my favorite hydrating eye cream!! It is the only product I’ve found that gives my dry under eyes all the hydration they need which also improves my dark circles. The product is a mixture between a gel and cream in texture and has a very cooling soothing effect. It smells great also! I use this product in the morning and evening to get these benefits. I would definitely recommend!\n",
      "Line1865: I adore this eye cream. It absorbs quickly which makes it easier to apply my moisturizer on top without displacing it. The texture is kind of a gel-cream hybrid. It’s cooling and it really does soften my fine lines. I will definitely be purchasing the full size.\n",
      "Line1866: Doesn’t help my hereditary dark circles but it does leave my skin soft and hydrated.\n",
      "Line1867: This is my favorite eye cream by far. It helps keep my under eyes refreshed and brings new life to them. It feels cooling, even without having to put it in the fridge.\n",
      "Line1868: I love how this leaves my skin feeling dewy. It does not irritate my sensitive eyes. It does not help along with tiredness but it great under makeup.\n",
      "Line1869: This eye cream is nice and lightly moisturizing. I love the gel texture. I was having an issue with milia before I started using this product, but once I switched to this, it cleared up. My under eyes still feel moisturized but it’s still light!\n",
      "Line1870: Really liked this eye cream in a first moment, though I find it too heavy even for my dry eye area. The price point is great though.\n",
      "Line1871: I have dryer under eyes and this eye cream is one of the best I’ve ever tried. It gives you 72 hrs of hydration under the eye. Also belif is an all natural brand as well.\n",
      "Line1872: I recieved the velof, moisturizing eye cream as a sample in my topbox and will definitely be adding it into my daily face care routine. I can already see the results after using it for a week\n",
      "Line1873: Nice hydrating eye cream. Didn’t do anything extra like brighten or reduce wrinkles but it does a good job of what it advertises which is moisture\n",
      "Line1874: Moisturizing indeed. This lightweight eye cream is wonderful. No residue, absorbs quickly and leaves the eye area looking refreshed. No sleepy eyes here! The cream is formulated so that a little goes a long way. Definitely a solid investment for the price.\n",
      "Line1875: This is my one and only product for eyes. I don’t use it regularly. Only one or two times in a week. It has thin consistence and feel very nice after applying.\n",
      "Line1876: This stuff is so good especially if your undereye is super dry like mine i like it because its not irritating and it gets the job done it doesn't make my concealer crease.\n",
      "Line1877: I initially liked this stuff alright. Still probably not worth the buy (I got this in my ipsy bag). After a week or two though, my under eyes were a mess. Dry, creased, and I had a bunch of milia which I don't usually have. It didn't help my dark circles at all. Definitely went way downhill.\n",
      "Line1878: This is my absolute holy grail eye cream and I will never stop using it!!! I have these weird lines under my eyes from a severe allergic reaction I had years ago, and now without a hydrating eye cream, they look so cracky under makeup. I’ve tried so many popular, highly rated ones and the only thing that worked before was the Kiehls Creamy Avocado which I used for years, but I didn’t love the consistency. But omg when I found this I’m never looking back. Gel cream is my favourite consistency in products and there is nothing to complains\n",
      "Line1879: This Eye Bomb is like magic to me. I use it every night. Even just after one use, my undereyes feel softer and the puffiness was gone the next day. That’s how I fell in love with it and continued to purchase it. A little goes a long way so it lasts you for months.\n",
      "Line1880: I received a sample of this product using points from Sephora, and after using it for a week I knew I had to purchase the full size. I normally don’t incorporate an eye cream into my skincare routine, but this is a staple for me now. It totally eliminates puffiness, makes my under eyes super smooth, and prevents creasing from my makeup. The value is long lasting and very much worth the money!\n",
      "Line1881: Je suis totalement fan de cette marque de soin ! Je les trouves tous parfaits, que ce soit les crèmes de jour, celles de nuit, celle pour le contour des yeux ! Je vous conseille de vraiment tester ces soins les filles ! Elles font des miracles sur la peau\n",
      "Line1882: Use this every morning after I take a shower . And cleanse my face. And makes me feel refreshed. And don’t have heavy bags under my eyes\n",
      "Line1883: I received this in my past Ipsy bag. I immediately fell in love with it. It is so moisturizing and sinks into the skin soo well. I am definitely going to be repurchasing it in the future!  This is a new holy grail for my nighttime skin routine. I would definitely recommend this to a friend!\n",
      "Line1884: Super refreshing to put on after the shower when your face feel like it needs quenched. I use it on my forehead as well where I have fine lines. LOVE this stuff. Great value.\n",
      "Line1885: This is a super light and moisturizing eye cream! Over the winter, I suddenly found my under eyes very dry, to the point where it was slightly flakey. However, after one treatment, my under eyes were rejuvenated again! A little definitely goes a long way with this product. I highly recommend this under eye treatment, especially over the harsh winter!\n",
      "Line1886: Love this product. I got it in my Ipsy bag a few months ago. A little goes a long way so even if you get the sample size it will last a while\n",

      "Line1888: Love this eye cream! so hydrating and light! i use this under my makeup and before i sleep. its not stinging my eyes either\n",
      "Line1889: This eye cream is great for many reasons. It helps to hydrate and moisturize the area but I also find that it's amazing for taking down puffiness. I have super sensitive and sometimes very dry eyelids and using this eye cream you immediately see the swelling go down. I recommend this for anyone who needs hydration and depuffing\n",
      "Line1890: This has been a lifesaver for my dry under eyes. For the longest time my eyes would look crepey underneath no.matter what I used and this smoothed, hydrated and plumped under my eyes for the day without re application. I would buy this product again.\n",
      "Line1891: This stuff is awesome. I love how a little goes a long way. I got this free as a sample along with some other stuff I purchased and I'm so glad I did. Its my new favorite eye cream. Its so hydrating and helps with puffiness and improves fine lines and its lightweight. Makeup goes on great over it.\n",
      "Line1892: I love the texture of this a lot! It has a thick gel consistency that feels really plush and hydrating. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a runny gel, but it’s not a thick cream. I feel like it hydrated so well and sits great under makeup as well if you want to use it during the day. A little goes a long way\n",
      "Line1893: my favorite and go to daily eye cream. I'm obsessed with the smell of this line. obsessed. I feel refreshed and wide awake once it settles in. the smell alone can do it. moisturizes that delicate area all day and night even!\n",
      "Line1894: Really love this eye moisturizer! Makes my eye area feel so moisturized and refreshed. This product lasted me for months and I used it to the last drop. I have yet to purchase again but absolutely will\n",
      "Line1895: This eyes moisturizer let your eye areas hydrate. You can used before your makeup or for daily used.\n",
      "Line1896: I love this eye moisturizer it is gentle and I noticed a huge difference in hydration. Skincare is pretty expensive but this ones worth it.\n",
      "Line1897: I like this product, but don’t love it. It’s very hydrating, but my biggest issue is that it leaves a sticky/tacky residue that’s still present in the morning when you wake up... I don’t like that feeling.\n",
      "Line1898: This is great because it is very light, almost watery but absorbs quickly. It has sort of a lavender scent which is very nice. I feel like my undereye concealer and powder work well over this too. I will take some and dab it on my cheekbones for extra glow after my makeup is done and set.\n",
      "Line1899: this is really nothing spectacular but I love it anyway. My main eye concern is moisture, and this provides moisture and doesn’t creep into my eyeballs so it’s a winner.\n",
      "Line1900: This eye cream is super moisturizing! It feels very soothing going on and definitely hydrates the eye area. Only reason I’m taking one star off is I don’t love that it has added fragrance and I don’t feel like it does anything for fine lines. But overall if you are looking for moisture this will definitely do it for you!\n",
      "Line1901: This eye bomb was definitely moisturizing and ALL the works. I tried a sample size from an Ipsy bag that I received, however I’m not sure that I would recommend this because I’ve read online that comfrey leaf may not be the greatest for humans to be putting on their delicate eye area. It’s in this moisturizer. There is another main ingredient in there too that I’m not too sure about. Maybe these ingredients are okay.. I just don’t want to take my chances. I wish I could give this five stars though, because it really was bomb!.\n",
      "Line1902: The price of this eye cream saddens me because I genuinely love it so much. It's so hard rating for my dry under eye area and it really gives my under eyes a plumped appearance. I have been using it to daily and have noticed a difference in my under-eye area. It really feels like a drink of water for your under eyes. I wish it was more affordable\n",
      "Line1903: I love this moisturizing eye balm. I have dry under eyes and this really keeps them hydrated. I highly recommend.\n",
      "Line1904: This is a very nice eye cream! Feels nice in the skin and moisturizes very well! Doesn’t irritate my eyes at all\n",
      "Line1905: I love this eye bomb. A small amount goes a long way. It creates a cooling, tingly effect when applied. Really works\n",
      "Line1906: Okay this product is a true lifesaver! I developed eczema round my eyes last winter and this cleared it up after so many other products failed. I will forever be grateful for this product.\n",
      "Line1907: I received a sample of this eye cream from Ipsy. I was a little bit apprehensive to try this as I’ve read a lot of reviews about people getting milia around their eyes. I’m happy that hasn’t happened to me (yet) but I haven’t noticed a difference around my eyes after about a week of daily use. I will continue to use the sample until it runs out but I don’t think I will be purchasing a full size of this.\n",
      "Line1908: A little goes a long way! I really like the gel consistency of this product. I find that I can dab as little or as much as I want and it doesn’t go on feeling greasy or oily. It is a bit pricey but considering how little I need, I’m not surprised that this product is lasting me a long time. It has a light, refreshing smell to it — nothing too strong.\n",
      "Line1909: This ice cream has a really nice texture and blends well underneath the eyes without tugging. It is also super hydrating so that’s definitely a plus! it doesn’t have any crazy sent either so that’s really nice!\n",
      "Line1910: just as the moisturizing bomb, this works great. but i don;t know how much different it is from it's flagship product (more concentrated?) it was pleasant to use, though im not sure how much it did other than keep my eyelids moisturized.\n",
      "Line1911: I received this eye cream in my Ipsy Glam Bag Plus Box. I purchased this as a sample as an add-on. I have been using this for ten days twice daily in my skincare regimen. This is such an emollient moisturizer that makes the eye area feel hydrated all day. There is a faint light scent that I enjoy as I do not like scented products, but this is light and lovely. Thus far, this beautiful gel moisturizer is wonderful and the first product I have tried from Belif. I am anxious to see the skincare benefits of this product over time and will purchase the full-sized product in the future. I recommend this eye cream for someone seeking hydration without the oily and greasy feeling.\n",
      "Line1912: Love it, such a simple hydrating eye cream, I use it once in a while when my eyes are feeling extra dry and this hydrated them right away! Love it keep it handy all the time!\n",
      "Line1913: A pretty good eye cream! Did make my eyes tear up a bit even though I didn’t get it into my actual eyes.\n",
      "Line1914: This works well for your under eyes! If you have dry under eyes like me this does work pretty good. I liked it. This is a great brand that’s for sure. I don’t know if I would buy this again because it was kinda expensive. But it is good.\n",
      "Line1915: Absolutely love this eye bomb! It is the biggest drink you'll ever give your eyes. You only need a little bit and your eyes have moisture all day! Never have you makeup cake or settle into your creases again with this moisturizer ♡\n",
      "Line1916: An affordable eye cream that helps moisturize the under eye area! This is great for someone that experiences dryness under the eyes and to prevent aging!\n",
      "Line1917: I’m happy with this product and I would buy it again. Not greasy, lovely under makeup and doesn’t sting at all when it goes on. I have huge dark circles, and some hollows, so nothing is going to fix that, but it plumps my undereye and I feel moisturizer. I’m saving my 5 stars for a miracle under eye dark circle remover from the heavens that doesn’t exist and maybe never will. Until then 4 is my highest and hard to beat.\n",
      "Line1918: I reallllly love this eye cream. It is lightweight and feels great on my skin. Very hydrating.\n",
      "Line1919: Received this as part of a Belief holiday pack. Will repurchase. Works good. Does a nice job of hydrating the skin around my eyes.\n",
      "Line1920: One of the only eye creams that i have used that doesn’t irritate my eyes or feel heavy in my skin. This moisturizer quickly absorbs into the skin and leaves my eye area moisturized the next morning. The jar also lasts forever - a little goes a long way so the price is well worth it!\n",
      "Line1921: This has a lightweight feel and is very moisturizing. It layered nicely under concealer and did not cause caking.\n",
      "Line1922: I love Belif and this product is amazing. Leaves you eye area moisturized all day long.\n",
      "Line1923: Non greasy feel and seems to do a great job hydrating my undereye area. I hope it helps with the fine lines. A bit pricey.\n",
      "Line1924: In love with this moisturizer! This moisturizer brings my face back to life and makes it so supple and glow. It does not leave my face sticky after applied. The smell of this product is great. It is not over whelming. Overall I would recommend this product to a friend.\n",
      "Line1925: This is extremely moisturizing and soaks quickly into the skin. It doesn’t leave any greasy residue and makes my under eyes look great!\n",
      "Line1926: Love this eye cream. I received this from my Ipsy subscription as a add on. I use this every morning and night and it reduces the dark puffiness around my eyes. Plan on purchasing the full size.\n",
      "Line1927: I love this product especially at this price! My undereyes are not in major need or hydration and I don’t have deep dark circles and this is just the right amount of hydration for my skin.\n",
      "Line1928: Belif  makes beautiful hydrating products. This eye bomb works well in the mornings and under makeup. It leaves the eyes bright and soft.\n",
      "Line1929: This is one of the few and only eye creams I’ve used that doesn’t burn my eye after application. I LOVE IT! It’s a bit pricey but it works and you get your money’s worth. It keeps my eye area feeling soft and moistened. A little goes a long way with this!\n",
      "Line1930: This is seriously my go to eye cream. There is no other eye cream that I use this is the only one that I’ve used for years. It leaves my under eyes looking nice and hydrated without being greasy and oily\n",
      "Line1931: I've only been using this for about a week and I notice such a difference. A little goes a long way with this product! Feels great too\n",
      "Line1932: Kind of irritated my eyes and I didn’t notice anything special while using it.  No improvement in wrinkles or fine lines\n",
      "Line1933: If you like aqua bomb, you'll like the eye bomb. They are pretty much the same.. Both great. A little bit goes a very long way\n",
      "Line1934: Nice to apply. Nice packaging. Buce scent. Feels nice but don’t think it does anything for my skin\n",
      "Line1935: I love this eye cream. It relieves puffiness and the appearance of dark circles. It builds really well with the rest of my skincare too.\n",
      "Line1936: Smooths my under eyes like a dream! Will repurchase. I got this originally as a sample in an Xmas kit, but I love it and have repurchased it a few times now.\n",
      "Line1937: I love the texture of this eye cream, and how quickly it absorbs. It leaves my under eyes looking plump and hydrated.\n",
      "Line1938: All of the products I’ve purchased from the Belif line-I absolutely love!  They have also become favorites & repurchases! This is no different & one of my very favorite eye creams! It has a clean, soft scent & creamy texture. Gives great moisture & hydration for hours, melts in right away & feels fabulous on my skin! Perfect for under my concealer & my evening skincare routine. I only apply this around my orbital bones as I have heard from many people that this has caused Milia on their skin. However, this has never been an issue for me.\n",
      "Line1939: I absolutely love it. I recieve a sample in my ipsy glam bag, just like most of the products i have tried, and i love it. I put it on at night....and i wake up looking like i actually got some sleep.\n",
      "Line1940: I recieved this product in a deluxe sample size with my August 2019 Ipsy glam bag. Ive been using it for two weeks now and i really like it. My eyes look much better. The dark circles are clearing up and the puffiness going down. I like the packaging. I think its simple but pretty. Quite pricey...i think its possible you could use a cheaper product and get the same results. It feels nice on the skin. Its super lightweight BUT it doesn't dry down that well/fast which ia a bit confusing. I have to make sure i use this as my eye cream and night or only on days that I'm not going to do my makeup because even after all my skincare when i get around to applying my concealer and foundation, my under eye is still damp no matter how much i pat and rub.\n",
      "Line1941: I have eczema and often get it under my eyes and on my eyelids.  Most lotions, eye bombs etc make it worse.  The belif eye bomb is the only product that helps with the eczema and tightens and firms my under eyes.  My dark circles and puffiness had also decreased leaving my eyes looking younger!\n",
      "Line1942: This product is amazing. This nourished my under eyes like a dream! It truly does what it says it will! Love it!\n",
      "Line1943: I love this Marquette I like this product👍👍 he is my best Marquette 💗💗 I love it he is a good and perfect 👌👌\n",
      "Line1944: So I just started using this and so far it’s working well. My eyes feel moisturized. Hopefully with long term use I’ll see a difference and stop having creases under foundation 😁\n",
      "Line1945: This product is amazing. I have extreme dry under eyes and when i apply this product in my night time skin care rountine, and when wake up in the morning with my under eyes are hydrated. This product has a thick consistency but i does melt in the skin nicely. Doesn't do well under makeup. I would reccomend this product.\n",
      "Line1946: I recived a small sample of Belif moisturising eye bomb and I really needed a eye cream and its really nice it helps keep my eyes nice and soft and soft. Its really good stuff.\n",
      "Line1947: I received this in my Ipsy bag and initially I was skeptical that it would provide the moisture that I needed. Upon application,  it didn't feel as moisturizing as I would have liked, but once it fully absorbed,  I was amazed.  My eye area was smooth and extremely well moisturized. What a fantastic surprise!\n",
      "Line1948: Love this product!!! A little goes along way and I swear it gets rid of under eye circles\n",
      "Line1949: I Love this brand's products so much!  This eye moisturizer is light weight, smells amazing, and instantly brightens and moisturizes!\n",
      "Line1950: Love this ! Light weight and absorbs quickly without residue. No Oder and feels so nice on the skin. Wouldn’t recommend for discoloration but great for hydration and reliable moisture for sure. Decent price and great amount\n",
      "Line1951: Love this product for puffiness and darkness under my eyes! Brightened my eyes in a short time. Absolutely love the feel. Not sticky and glides right on. If u haven't tried this product I suggest you do so!!\n",
      "Line1952: One of my holy grail eye creams before I switched to the current one I’m on now. My eyes can tend to get very dried out especially being a makeup wearer. Every time I used this, and I’ve gone through 4 of these, my under eyes feel hydrated and good for makeup prep. It’s light weight and very hydrating.\n",
      "Line1953: My under eyes are my worst feature ; its dark and puffy.Not cute!! I tried the aqua bomb and let me tell you ITS THE BOMB!!!  From one eye area to the other you can see a difference..First time user who is hooked.\n",
      "Line1954: I received this in an Ipsy bag. A little goes a long ways. It is not heavy or greasy. I love it. I will be repurchasing this eye cream.\n",
      "Line1955: Nice lightweight daytime eye cream. This cream isn't heavy and absorbs quickly into the eye area. This is very gentle for my sensitive eyes. I feel it is a great moisturizer but it did not work any miracles it just kept my under eyes hydrated. It would be nice if it did diminish wrinkles.\n",
      "Line1956: I really love this eye cream. I have never been able to afford a full priced container (which is the biggest con in my opinion). However, everytime I have an option for the sample size, I go for it. (I think I've gone through 2-3 of the sample jars). It is soft, leaves skin feeling moisturized and dewy. Hydrates my eyes and helps me not get crazy under eye bags even when I don't get a lot of sleep. Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "Line1957: I’m a huge fan of this brand. The eye cream is gentle and hydrating for my (very) sensitive skin. It provides a great dose of moisture in a very dry climate.\n",
      "Line1958: I wish this wasn't so pricey, but it is so good that when I feel the need to splurge on an eye cream, this is my go to luxury-ish brand. It really makes my dry under eyes look hydrated and refreshed. It absorbs into the skin nicely. It also layers under concealer really well too.\n",
      "Line1959: Love this product, I always use it in the morning and what I love the most about it is that is cruelty free!\n",
      "Line1960: Creamy, but could be more rich. It’s easily absorbed and light, great every day eye cream.\n",
      "Line1961: Ok first I love all belief product! This eye balm was amazing! So hydrating and feels so nice going on. It leave you feeling hydrated and refreshed in the morning. I will definitely be buying this when I run out!\n",
      "Line1962: I only have a sample size of this but it works wonders. I have bags under my eyes that are dry and this product has really helped with that!\n",
      "Line1963: Only eye cream that I use. I have extremely dry under eyes. This eye cream really moisturizes the under eye but is not heavy. This eye cream is also great under makeup as well.\n",
      "Line1964: I was pleasantly surprised with this product. It was a small sample that I received as a free bonus from Sephora and I love it! This review is not sponsored.\n",
      "Line1965: This product has rave reviews but I'm not sure if I can get behind the hype. It certainly moisturizes the under eye area, but I don't think it's anything to write home about (especially for the price). It does a fine job, but I don't really miss it when I swap it for something else.\n",
      "Line1966: I decided to splurge on an eye cream a few months back and let me tell you this is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made!!!!\n",
      "Line1967: This eye cream is great for sensitive skin. I used a lash serum that irritated the skin around my eyes. This was the only eye cream, out of several, that didn’t irritate that skin and actually soothed it. I will definitely be repurchasing it!\n",
      "Line1968: In love with this product, my under eye are feels 100 times better than before. Super gentle and refreshing\n",
      "Line1969: I originally got the sample size in an Ipsy bag two years ago, and I loved it so much I had to buy the full-size. This is all I’ve been using ever since around my eyes. It leaves your skin hydrated for a whole day. It’s a little pricey but in my opinion completely worth it. I suffer with dark circles under my eyes, and unfortunately it does not get rid of the dark circles. It just takes care of the skin around the eyes.\n",
      "Line1970: I've been helping for a long time. An unusual product. love it very much❣❣❣ It is a necessary product🥰🥰🥰\n",
      "Line1971: The Greatest eye bomb ever! Texture nice and hydrating. Easily sinks in the skin. Great feeling on skin\n",
      "Line1972: This eye cream is so nice. A good layer of moisture for at night or during the day under makeup.\n",
      "Line1973: One of my top three under eye creams. The packaging is so cute with the blue and black. I love the way this cream feels. So smooth and luxurious under the eye. Really does hydrate and plump up any fine lines or wrinkles.\n",
      "Line1974: I have few trial size if this eye bomb and been using it daily. It is light but hydrating enough to remove fine line underneath my eyes.\n",
      "Line1975: My favorite eye moisturizer! It really is extremely hydrating. If this was a product I could afford on the regular I would definitely buy it every time. Highly recommend this eye moisturizer! It glides so nicely and a little goes a long way!\n",
      "Line1976: I only tried this product as a sample from Sephora when I first started experimenting with eye creams. I can’t speak much for the long term results, but if you are looking for an eye cream that provides a TON of moisture that actually lasts through the day, this is your eye cream. Probably the most moisturizing I’ve ever tried and I’ve tried many. So I’m giving 5 stars based on the moisture, also that a little really does go a long way. My small sample lasted almost 2 weeks which was nice!\n",
      "Line1977: I really enjoyed using this product. My under eyes felt more hydrated after the first use. After a couple months of use, my fine lines plumped up and are not as visible.\n",
      "Line1978: I love how smooth and refreshing this feels! A tiny amount goes a really long way. Makes my makeup look very smooth.\n",
      "Line1979: My favorite eye cream! I've tried many eye creams and this one is the most hydrating. I have some find lines under my eyes and rather than treating it with a firming cream, I use this because it really hydrates and pumps my skin and in return, fine lines are less noticeable. The texture of my skin looks so much better. I'll continue to repurchase.\n",
      "Line1980: Its a good eye cream just not as thick as I would like mine to be. I prefer a thicker consistency and this one is very lightweight. It would be very good for people who wear eye cream under makeup however. It did a good job moisturizing my undereye though.\n",
      "Line1981: Really good! I bought mine a few months ago in a trip to Boston and I haven’t stopped using ever since. Light weight, my under eye skin feels smooth and I’ve started to notice that my eye bags are improving. Love it!\n",
      "Line1982: I love this eye product. I notice a huge difference when I use it. My only complaint is that it doesn’t work well as an under eye primer. But otherwise awesome!\n",
      "Line1983: Reduces fine lines and wrinkles under the eye, and is very moisturizing! It plumps up the skin, and the scent is light and fresh.\n",
      "Line1984: A lightweight, refreshing eye cream that smooths fine lines with a 26-hour burst of moisture, boosts elasticity, and increases the resilience of the skin for flawless makeup application.\n",
      "Line1985: I like how this product is so smooth and creamy, it makes your skin feel relief and fresh!\n",
      "Line1986: This was a good eye cream. It worked well and got the job done. Nothing special about It tho could be replaced with any other good eye creamn\n",
      "Line1987: I can just drink this product up! After a night routine, the next morning my eyes feels like I’ve never worked or been stressed the week before!\n",
      "Line1988: one of the best eye contours that I have tried, I love it, it also moisturizes a lot and my eyelet is very dry, and it is not a heavy contour quickly absorbs yes gel type, it is my favorite\n",
      "Line1989: I love this eye cream. It’s so moisturizing and it feels like your getting a facial every time you use it. It does have a slight citrus scent so if you’re sensitive to scents, this may not be the eye cream for you. But it’s thick so you barely have to use a lot, I recommend it.\n",
      "Line1990: Keeps under eye area hydrated and healthy looking. Ive been using twice a day for over a year now. There's a good amount in the container and you don't need to use a lot. I usually try to buy when Sephora has a VIB sale.\n",
      "Line1991: I am giving this 3 stars because I really didn’t see any improvement. I will say it smells great and feels great. It really hydrated the skin but I wouldn’t say it’s only just for the eyes, it’s just lotion to me I would say.\n",
      "Line1992: After reading the rave reviews I decided to purchase this eye cream. Well, it was not the Holy Grail status cream for me. The skin around my eyes is sensitive and dry. While this cream is super lightweight with gel like consistency,  it irritated the skin around my eyes and I got small red bumps underneath my eyes. This cream also did not provide any moisture to my parched under eye area. This was just a miss for me.\n",
      "Line1993: I love this eye cream. It’s very nourishing. I find it effective. I’ve even taken it on vacations since they have travel sizes that are very convenient. Packaging is really good.\n",
      "Line1994: I love using this product. I have repurchased it a few times. I think it really makes a difference for my under eyes. It is luxurious and refreshing. So gentle! I recommend it for sure.\n",
      "Line1995: This is a really good eye cream. It's so hydrating and lightweight. It sinks in easily and leaves my skin feeling plump and moisturized. I also feel like the more moisturized my skin is the less noticeable my dark circles are. Highly recommend\n",
      "Line1996: Another winner by belief. I don't generally buy eye creams as I can't really tell a difference after using them. However, this brand is amazing when it comes to hydration which is what my very dry skin needs. My under eye area both looked and felt more hydrated after using overnight. I definitely recommend!\n",
      "Line1997: So I loved the way this went on face. But my the morning I was broken out all over my face.  I was disappointing.  I wanted to love it so much.\n",
      "Line1998: I love this eye cream for under makeup. Its works great under concealer. When I’m using a formula that’s drying I love to apply this eye cream so that It doesn’t look cakey.\n",
      "Line1999: Love this product and how much is in it for the price! The packaging is sleek in shape and minimalist in design. I love that this isn't a heavy cream! It also feels so refreshing, gentle, and cooling. Definitely one I will buy again as I'm pretty picky on eye creams.\n",
      "Line2000: I LOVE this eye cream. It keeps my undereyes but doesn’t cause too much milia, which I can get if my eye cream is too heavy. I think that it’s a little pricey and wish the packaging was a little bit smaller,but overall I do really like it.\n",
      "Line2001: I love this eye cream. It leaves my under eye super hydrated and it absorbs quickly. I don't mind that it comes in a tub, a little goes a long way. I wouldn't change anything about this eye cream. Very good eye cream, just wish it was a little cheaper.\n",
      "Line2002: I really love this stuff. It is really effective at hydrating your under eyes. I am a new user of this product and I have used a few by different companies. It definitely met my expectations in an under eye product. I definitely recommend this product.\n",
      "Line2003: My favorite eye moisturizer, it has the perfect consistency and makes me feel very hydrated. It’s perfect!\n",
      "Line2004: This eye cream is the bomb. My under eyes used to be dry but this was gentle yet hydrating enough.\n",
      "Line2005: YASSS! Must buy. I use the aqua bomb facial moisturizer along with this eye cream and they are literally a dynamic duo. Must add to your daily regimen!! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line2006: I received a mini version of this as a sample or something, so I didn’t use it consistently. I did find it leaving my undereyes with a very cooling effect though. And not too heavy like a lot of eye creams I’ve experienced\n",
      "Line2007: I love how hydrating this belif moisturizing eye bomb is yet it doesnt feel heavy or tacky. It is not overly fragrant and i think it works very well.\n",
      "Line2008: I bought a tiny size of this to try and i love it. It is light weight and absorbs quickly . My makeup lays very nice over it\n",
      "Line2009: Not one to normally even use eye cream but I love this stuff! My eyes are super sensitive and this has been one of the few eye products that haven’t irritated them! I love it!\n",
      "Line2010: This eye cream is perfect for day time wear but I feel like I need something more heavy duty for nighttime. It works well under makeup but I have not noticed a huge difference in the overall appearance or hydration of my skin\n",
      "Line2011: This is the most refreshing eye gel! It’s so cooling when you apply it & really moisturizes the under eye. It doesn’t do anything for brightening but for just cooling and moisture this is perfect. I would really recommend this if you have dry under eyes. I haven’t tried it under makeup but this is awesome for night time.\n",
      "Line2012: Love this eye cream. Very moisturizing and I love the texture. Definitely see a difference when I am using it to the lines around my eyes and my bags.\n",
      "Line2013: I’ve been using this for 2 years and I swear by it. It use it morning and night in alteration with other skincare as well. But this is one I always go back to. It moisturizes well and my eyes are very sensitive and this doesn’t make my eyes water like crazy like slot of products do. It plumps and hydrates the eye area very well. Recommend this as a must have!\n",
      "Line2014: Big fan!!!!!!!!!!! Worse it of trying !!!!!!!!!! Pretty simple and gentle  Easy to use Feel hydrated and fresh after couple used  Easy to travel with\n",
      "Line2015: Great eye cream!  I only gave it three stars because it's a bit pricey for the amount you get. This creme does leave your skin feeling more greasy and doesn't blend easily into the skin.\n",

      "Line2017: Super light and hydrating - and you only need a tiny amount as a little goes a long way. It's pricey, though. I got a mini version as part of a Belif set, so it was essentially free. I wouldn't shell out $48 for 0.84 oz.\n",
      "Line2018: Absolutely LOVE this product. It is the one I use every night before going to bed. It helps with my puffy eyes. During the week I tend not to sleep as much, around 4 to 5 hrs, so I usually have a tired face the next day... until I used this product. Highly recommended! And the best part is that it gives you a refreshing sensation when you apply it.\n",

      "Line2021: This is the most refreshing eye gel! It’s so cooling when you apply it & really moisturizes the under eye. It doesn’t do anything for brightening but for just cooling and moisture this is perfect. I would really recommend this if you have dry under eyes. I haven’t tried it under makeup but this is awesome for night time.\n",
      "Line2022: Love this eye cream. Very moisturizing and I love the texture. Definitely see a difference when I am using it to the lines around my eyes and my bags.\n",
      "Line2023: I’ve been using this for 2 years and I swear by it. It use it morning and night in alteration with other skincare as well. But this is one I always go back to. It moisturizes well and my eyes are very sensitive and this doesn’t make my eyes water like crazy like slot of products do. It plumps and hydrates the eye area very well. Recommend this as a must have!\n",

      "Line2025: Great eye cream!  I only gave it three stars because it's a bit pricey for the amount you get. This creme does leave your skin feeling more greasy and doesn't blend easily into the skin.\n",

      "Line2032: Your eyes are just as important as the rest of your skin. This was great for night time! Loved how my skin feels when using this.\n",
      "Line2033: This is amazing if you have fairly dry under eyes or even super dry. The scent is so good and it’s so light weight. It instantly hydrated and gives my under eyes a plump appearance and feel. Definitely recommend.\n",
      "Line2034: It does exactly what it says but my skin is very oily so sometimes I don't need that moisturizing of an eye and it can still tend to be a little oily so I always recommend maybe padding off excess or using less than you normally would for an eye cream. But for dry skin I think this would be amazing\n",
      "Line2035: It was a little to thick for me because my eye bags prefer a gel or lighter cream.  It did feel moisturizing but also too heavy for me and wasn’t easy to spread.  I think it might be better for someone with slightly more mature skin as I’m in my mid 20s.\n",
      "Line2036: This is one of three eye creams that I use. It’s great for moisturizing under the eye and it isn’t sticky nor does the moisture disappear after 5 minutes of it being on my skin. It works great under makeup and helps reduce fine lines due to dryness.\n",
      "Line2037: I received a deluxe size sample from Sephora. This is very moisturizing and feels really good in the under eye area. It felt like it was also depuffing, which means it's great to use in the morning. I would never purchase it though since it's not cruelty free.\n",
      "Line2038: This eye cream is pretty good.  It is nice and light, which I like for under the eyes.  It does not have an overwhelming scent and does not burn my eyes like some creams do.  It works well both and night and in the morning under makeup.\n",
      "Line2039: This is a good normal Eye cream. I wouldn’t say I have really dark circles or creases or wrinkles or anything so I just use this as a normal eye cream to just help with moisture\n",
      "Line2040: Moisturizing that’s about it. I don’t believe in miracles when it comes to eye cream that’s why I’m happy that it only claims what it actually claims to do. Plus you get a enormous product in a giant tub.\n",
      "Line2041: Love this a lot! I started having eczema around my eyes a few months ago. Wasn’t sure what to do about it and tried several eye creams. After  using this I haven’t had eczema since! Makes my undereyes so hydrated!!!!\n",
      "Line2042: Love this for when you need a little extra moisture and rejuvenation for your undereye\n",
      "Line2043: I wanted to like this so badly. Unfortunately, belif eye creams make my eyes tear up for days. I think it has to do  with the fact that they are very highly scented. Most highly scented skincare isn't for sensitive skin and even worse around the eye area...\n",
      "Line2044: I've been using this product for months. It has helped with the puffiness and coloration. I think it has improved my eyes. It is pricey but a little product goes a long way.\n",
      "Line2045: Excellent product. The areas around my eyes are dry and sometimes patchy. The belif eye bomb really helped moisturize and locked in moisture for the entire day. It is expensive for a small amount of product. But the small jar lasted me around 2 months.\n",
      "Line2046: One of my favorite products received, and it is now a staple in my skincare routine. Works really well, and provides a lot of moisture since my skin is normal/dry.\n",
      "Line2047: I typically apply this product under concealer if i know I’ll be wearing it so that it isn’t drying. This is a very good moisturizer and good for the eyes\n",
      "Line2048: I received this from a box and I absolutely love it. It is extremely hydrating and has a silky texture. I have purchased a few times since. It is a must try.\n",
      "Line2049: I got this product after seeing good reviews about it. I had hoped it make I dark eyes a little brighter but it didn’t do much. I might come back to this product when I get older as it might be more helpful then\n",
      "Line2050: I've liked every product I've tried from belif so far. I really like the texture of the belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. It's both rich and light at the same time, with a nice cooling sensation. I'm hoping to try the belif True Cream Moisturizing Bomb soon, and I think the two products together would feel very luxurious, at a reasonable price point.\n",
      "Line2051: Super moisturizing and isn’t greasy. Goes on lightly and lasts all day. A little definitely goes a long way with this product.\n",
      "Line2052: I use this with the Aqua bomb moisturizer from Belif and I'm obsessed. This stuff is amazing and I can't get enough. It's so soft and feels silky I just want it to be all over my face which I've done a time or two. Anyone with dry under eyes I would 100% recommend.\n",
      "Line2053: 10 of 10 would recommend! I bought the eye bomb during holiday season to test out and immediately was hooked! it hydrates your under eyes like crazy and I totally recommend\n",
      "Line2054: This feels great and smells great but is very slow to sink in for me- I can’t put make up on over it. It also made me oily around my eyes. It may be good in dry climates or for dry skin but was just more moisture than I need.\n",
      "Line2055: I just started using this eye cream. Put mine in my mini fridge for a super cooking effect. This really helps with my puffiness, I love how beautiful it absorbs, and can’t wait to see more from this product.\n",
      "Line2056: My favorite eye cream! A little definitely goes along way with this product and the consistency is more like a gel so it feels super lightweight and hydrating once applied! Almost instantly tightens under eye skin leaving no more bags, must try!\n",
      "Line2057: I’m now on my second jar and I am loving this. I have extremely sensitive skin and it’s hard to use any skin care line. But this stuff does the trick. I also use the moisturizer as well and together they are an amazing pair.\n",
      "Line2058: It’s a nice eye cream but I didn’t notice a difference from any of my fine lines.  It was hydrating enough, smooth enough, but I would not purchase this again.  Perhaps a more luxurious feeling would sell me.\n",
      "Line2059: This eye cream has helped my under eye bags completely!!! Also, it has helped my undereye concealer application tremendously! This is the best creek I’ve tried in a while❤️\n",
      "Line2060: Great for my undereye area!! I out this on before bedtime and let it soak on in. It soaks in and moisturizes my undereye area so well. A little goes a long way and too much builds up and get greasy so just use a bit\n",
      "Line2061: Un contorno de ojos de textura suave casi como un gel. Hidrata bien el contorno, no deja residuos y se absorve fácilmente. Dura bastante tiempo hidratado. Muy bueno para uso diurno o antes del maquillaje\n",
      "Line2062: I love this brand.  It is not very affordable, but worth the price.  It has a nice smell, is not sticky or tacky, helps add moisture to a very dry area of your face.  I find it to be effective, and I will continue to use this line of products.\n",
      "Line2063: Not hydrating enough. Still got some dehydration wrinkles even after apply this one. Little amount of product imo. Won't buy again.\n",
      "Line2064: This is my ultimate favorite eye cream. It is super moisturizing and a little goes a long way. It does not have an over powering scent nor does it make my skin react in a bad way the way it has with other high quality moisturizers. All in all Belief products have been my favorite moisturizers that I’ve used.\n",
      "Line2065: I loved this product. However, It was on the more expensive side. I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to prevent signs of aging, or who has very dry skin. It is a little too thick for people with oily skin to use. I use this product every night before I go to bed and I love it!\n",
      "Line2066: Never tried eye creams before and I'm in the process of building my skin care routine and decided to try this based on the reviews  it goes on light and did a bit of blurring.\n",
      "Line2067: Another eye cream with good reviews that I don't get.I actually didn't finish my sample size because this was doing nothing at all!If you don't naturally have plump undereyes and really need a good moisturising cream don't get this.From the texture I get it's  probably for people with puffiness issues.\n",
      "Line2068: Amazing texture! It's not heavy like all the other creams, but it's not too sheer that you think it's not working. It's like Spring, when the rains come and everywhere is dewy. You feel hydrated. Also, it can be used an eyeshadow primer. The price is high but it's worth it. Scent: super light.\n",
      "Line2069: I have a dry eye area and this eye cream was perfect, effective for my sensitive eye area, I was really impressed by this cream. It would be perfect if it came in a bigger size. The packaging not very practical I don’t like to put my fingers inside the cream because of my long nails but I would definitely recommend this product\n",
      "Line2070: Very moisturizing! Helped fill my under eye and helped with dry patches. The packaging was cute but simple.\n",
      "Line2071: The BEST eye cream I have ever used... too bad I have ran out of a sample I was using.\n",
      "Line2072: It’s so good! But so expensive! If I had money I would definitely purchase the full size!\n",
      "Line2073: My favorite eye moisturizer ever! It’s moisturizing and doesn’t leave any residue. It’s pricey but it lasts me a very long time! I have very sensitive skin and it’s not irritating.\n",
      "Line2074: Great eye cream if you are looking for hydration! Feels like you are splashing water under your eyes (in a good way!) or applying a cold spoon that is so relaxing. Also dries down almost like a balm.\n",
      "Line2075: This eye bomb is so moisturizing. It has a water-like consistency and applies smoothly. It leaves my under eye hydrated. However I didn't see much difference in the lines or dark circles under my eye. And it's pretty pricey for the amount of product.\n",
      "Line2076: This is a nice eye cream. It has a refreshing feeling and isn’t too thick or thin. My eye area feels much more moisturized after using this product. I would recommend!\n",
      "Line2077: Super hydrating and smoothing. Does NOT crease under makeup but definitely keeps the eye area from feeling too dry under products. It also doesn’t sting if it gets in the eye which is a huge plus!\n",
      "Line2078: This container contains a good amount of product!   It feels great under the eye and wears well under makeup! It is hydrating...but doesn’t necessarily fix my super dry undereye days that nothing else helps either. Overall recommend!!\n",
      "Line2079: It’s just way too good, and I haven’t found a good replacement for it. Of course there are other creams or serums that brighten or tighten or depuff for the day, but this feels like it long-term changes your face.\n",
      "Line2080: I truly wish I could give this a 4.5/5 because it is so close to being perfect, but just not quite there. It is so incredibly moisturizing, which is my entire pursuit in an eye cream. Lovely texture, nice dry down, doesn’t stay tacky for too long. I do need to be careful with this before eye make up - if you use too much or don’t wait long enough, it will pill and crease with eye primer or eye shadow. The only things that would make this perfect for me are better packaging (some kind of squeeze, very annoying to constantly use a spatula), and if it was more gel and less cream (less thick).\n",
      "Line2081: My favorite eye cream - I keep getting samples of it and am about to bite the bullet and get the full size. Many eye creams are too thick and occlude the skin under my eyes, even causing milea, but NOT THIS ONE! It is light and has a cooling sensation and works year round. I even put it on my eyelids, which I'm usually careful about as they are sensitive. The scent is really nice too.\n",
      "Line2082: This product is very moisturizing, however I’m not sure I see results better than layering my normal moisturizer under the eye. It has a tingling feeling and a pleasant scent upon application.\n",
      "Line2083: I really like how thick this product feels, super moisturizing and a little goes a long way. I only used this before bed because the product is really thick and takes a while to dry. Feels lovely!\n",
      "Line2084: This cream is great uplift for your eyes! It isn’t sticky and it helps with wrinkles and bags!\n",
      "Line2085: This eye cream is great for dry skin as it hydrates a lot and it's gentle as well. A small amount goes a long way! I've had the sample size for awhile now and been using it almost every day.\n",
      "Line2086: they are NOT joking when they call it a BOMB!!! this product FLOODS my eyes with moisture, one dot goes a long way, and i can always always ALWAYS turn to this guy for a good pick me up in the eye area\n",
      "Line2087: This is a great moisturizing eye cream, I was very happy with this product! I also love that this brand is cruelty free!\n",
      "Line2088: I love belif brand, this eye cream has truly helped improved the skin around my eyes, and it is really moisturizing, you really only need a little bit of product, I definitely recommend it!\n",
      "Line2089: It’s fine - it’s a nice eye cream with a gel-like consistency.  Absorbs fast and smells pretty good.\n",
      "Line2090: It’s a little expensive but a little goes a long way. It’s super soothing and I’ve noticed a huge improvement in my under eyes\n",
      "Line2091: Great smell and very moisturizing! It's not incredibly expensive compared to other stuff, so it's good that this actually helps to reduce eye bag size, and is more affordable! I would buy again, I received mine as a present.\n",
      "Line2092: I AM OBSESSED WITH THIS EYE CREAM! It is so light and hydrating. When you put it on, it doesn't feel thick or creamy. The packaging is blue and black and very chic. I think this product is great morning and night. It helps tighten the undereyes and remove dark circles.\n",
      "Line2093: Once again, Belif knocked it out of the park with an awesome product! This eye cream is a dream for puffy, under eye circles and feels so nourishing to the eye area. I feel that it did noticeably help with dry areas around my eye the next morning after use. I prefer to use this at night. Love!!!\n",
      "Line2094: I love this eye cream so much. It’s very hydrating and the moisture lasts all day for youthful and rested eyes.\n",
      "Line2095: This actually ended up drying me out and causing a lot of flaking under my eyes. My skin is pretty oily, so it’s not like I lean towards dry skin. With moisturizing right in the name, I expected a lot more. Pretty disappointing.\n",

It is pricier than the drugstore brands but on the lower end of the high end brands so depending on your personal budget, this is a good product. I prefer something with some antiaging properties as well, but they have another product with firming so that can be an option for those that arent just looking to moisturize\n",

I had a dry patch on my eyelid and made eye shadows look no so cute. This product really hydrates the skin and actually made my dry patch disappear.\n",
      "Line2124: This is a really cool and refreshing eye cream. I’ve found very few eye creams I actually like because my eye area is very sensitive, and most tend to be irritating. But I’ve had no issues with this one and it definitely does a good job of adding moisture to my eye area.\n",

It was cooling to my eye area and seemed very gentle which is a very good thing since you putting it on your delicate eye area. Sadly, I did not see any results, my wrinkles laughed at the cream and the tears I cried as I saw no results just washed it away. I am sad but I have moved on to try other things. I am sure that others may see results it just wasnt the product for me.\n",

I prefer something with some antiaging properties as well, but they have another product with firming so that can be an option for those that arent just looking to moisturize\n",
      "Line2144: I didn’t feel like this was very hydrating under the eye but also didn’t cause any milia.\n",
      "Line2145: The best thing ever! If you want something that cooling and that makes your eyes feel super hydrated then this stuff you will love. It is on the more pricey side but it’s worth it.\n",
      "Line2146: This stuff is literally the bomb. You can tell just from opening it that it will be a nice forming cream, but it’s also moisturizing. I seriously LOVE this stuff and cannot recommend it enough.\n",
      "Line2147: this is so good, so hydrating, i bought two different sets from belif, each included eye bomb, loved using both 5ml, i would repurchase full size after i go through my current ones\n",
      "Line2148: This is my fav! I use it every night it just leaves your eye area feeling so moisturized and tight\n",
      "Line2149: I have been using this eye cream for a while and a little goes a long way. It’s really hydrating and creamy and I really like the texture. The scent is subtle and really pleasant. It isn’t my holy grail eye cream but I will gladly use it till my jar is gone.\n",
      "Line2150: I bought this product about a month ago recommended by my dermatologist and I am so pleased with the results.  It feels more hydrated and nourished.\n",
      "Line2151: This product is amazing! I love the packaging the product everything. It smells amazing on top of being very moisturizing and cooling to the eye area which is important for the depuffing. I would recommend this for anyone looking for an eye cream\n",
      "Line2152: I love this product! Anything to hydrate the area around my eyes is a must for me! I feel less wrinkles and very smooth when I use this product! The package is nice and sleek!\n",
      "Line2153: If you have dry patches around your eyes or you’re concealer doesn’t try smoothly around your eyes. This product will definitely fix these problems. I had a dry patch on my eyelid and made eye shadows look no so cute. This product really hydrates the skin and actually made my dry patch disappear.\n",
      "Line2154: This is a really cool and refreshing eye cream. I’ve found very few eye creams I actually like because my eye area is very sensitive, and most tend to be irritating. But I’ve had no issues with this one and it definitely does a good job of adding moisture to my eye area.\n",
      "Line2155: I use this eye cream daily. I like that it doesn’t feel extra heavy and it is more of a gel-like consistency. It’s very hydrating for the under eyes!\n",
      "Line2156: I’m obsessed with all things Belif! This eye cream feels so smooth and keeps the skin under my eyes feeling and looking hydrated.\n",
      "Line2157: Fave daytime eye cream. It’s deeply moisturising, creates a great base for makeup and I love how my under eye feels when I use it. It’s generously sized and worth the price. I’d repurchase for my am routine.\n",
      "Line2158: I trusted belief because I love their aqua bomb. And was in search of an eye cream. This product is the most affordable high end eye cream and it works Amazing.\n",
      "Line2159: Love this product so much, it leaves my eyes very moisturised and is good value for money. The crepe was nice an lightweight-not to harsh on my skin- and it was nicely packaged. Really looking forward to trying more Belif products in future belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line2160: I don’t think I’ll use a different eye cream ever again! This is AMAZING! It makes your skin feel so smooth and hydrated. When you put it on at night, you can see/feel the results the next morning!\n",
      "Line2161: I've been using it for four months and it hydrates the area around my eyes well. I find that eyeshadow glides on more smoothly since I started using it, but nothing too extraordinary. The price is kind of high for being a regular cream.\n",
      "Line2162: Love this I have repurchased this product although it is a bit pricey completely worth it\n",
      "Line2163: I love this moisturizer. It is amazing! The texture is water like and refreshing to the contact. I could wear it for night and day routine. It is super good on sensitive skin. I highly recommend. No scent at all. Just perfect.\n",
      "Line2164: Absolutely love this moisturizer. It keep under-eye hydrated and it doesn’t feel oily. I also the texture. I usually put it on before I go to bed. It’s a nice balance for your skin and leaves my eyes less puffy in the morning.\n",
      "Line2165: Thought I was going to love this product, but wasn’t a must have for me. Formula felt nice and was a good consistency, and a little definitely went a long way, but didn’t seem to make a difference on my eye area.\n",
      "Line2166: I use this morning and night. This is a great product for sensitive skin. It is very gentle and has no real smell to it. I love the packaging and how long the product lasts! This is my go to eye bomb!\n",
      "Line2167: Love, love, love this product! Very lightweight and not greasy at all! Has a cooling effect. It reduced some wrinkles and fine lines I had undereye. I got it for the first time and will get it again!\n",
      "Line2168: Extremely moisturizing product! I love the texture and consistency of this eye cream. Its very light and it absorbs to the skin really quickly. This product is great even for oily/combination skin. Highly recommended. I would definitely buy it again.\n",
      "Line2169: My skin is dry and love the belif products. This eye cream definitely works and hydrates my skin.\n",
      "Line2170: I got this in box of skin care items from Sephora. I wanted to start my anti-aging skin care early on in my life because it takes a while to see results. The thing I like about this is that it is really moisturizing. However, I feel like that’s the only thing it is good for. I would not go out of my way to buy this again.    EDIT: after using this for several months, I DO NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT. Yes it is moisturizing BUT it caused little non-irritating tiny bumps under my eyes. ALSO, the veins near my eyes starting becoming more apparent. Has it reduced wrinkles? I see NO DIFFERENCE. I’m more self conscious about my under eyes now more than ever. I’m only keeping 2 stars because it is actually very moisturizing.\n",
      "Line2171: Great eye cream that hydrated and moisturizes the under eye! It’s very gentle and feels like water. It’s so thin and sits so beautifully under make up. I always have a jar and have repurchased several times!\n",
      "Line2172: Very very very moisturizing, a great consistency, thats very easy to apply and use. Even a little dab of this gives off so much moisture, so it lasts a while, considering it’s size. I use it after I cleanse, tone, and put on my spot treatment. 😍😍😍\n",
      "Line2173: I love this eye cream it makes my under eye soft. Nice packaging the only thing is you need a small spatula.\n",
      "Line2174: This is my most favorite eye care product. The way it applies and dries onto your skin perfect. I absolutely love it\n",
      "Line2175: Pretty good product. A little bit goes a long way, as the formula is very thick. I was expecting something lighter, as the aqua bomb is so airy. However, my eyes looked pretty good afterwards.\n",
      "Line2176: I love how hydrating this eye cream is! A little goes a long way and it does a great job at making the eye area feel plump and moisturized.\n",
      "Line2177: I have a fairly dry t-zone, so I use this under my eyes and on my nose at center of forehead. My skin was so much smoother and nourished when using in those areas. My under-eye concealer applies smoother with less creasing when using as well.\n",
      "Line2178: If you are willing to splurge on an eye cream this is the product you need to get. It absorbs super quickly, it's not too thick and leaves your eyes feeling nice and cool. I like it especially for the hydration factor and how it helps with the puffiness. It is a great eye cream and I'm so glad I made the plunge on purchasing it.\n",
      "Line2179: Love this eye cream it’s so light and hydrating it doesn’t feel sticky at all. I don’t have wrinkles but I’m just using it for preventative care! I got a free sample so why not?!\n",
      "Line2180: Nice to have, but not really necessary unless you have an overly dry eye area. Feels nice and is definitely different from the face cream. It feels refreshing and cools off dry eyebrows especially. Worth a try!\n",
      "Line2181: I always use this right before bed, it helps depuff my eyes and is great for the sensitive skin around my eyes. I will definitely repurchase and use again! It’s really great, I recommend it to all my friends\n",
      "Line2182: I’ve gone through two of these and I just love them! It’s a thick, hydrating gel formula that works well for daytime under makeup or at night to hydrate your under eyes for the morning. There’s a reason this had such a cult following.\n",
      "Line2183: Amazing eye cream that hydrates and smooths the texture under the eye with tons of hyaluronic acid. Absorbs quickly into skin so it’s perfect underneath makeup.\n",
      "Line2184: Love this eye cream! Super hydrating but it is not heavy feeling at all. Can be used in the morning time and night! You also don’t have to use a crazy amount since it is thin and spreads pretty far.\n",
      "Line2185: I bought a sample size of this and loved every use of it. It goes on so well and is extremely lightweight. It almost feels cooling under the eyes. You only need a little and it goes a long way. I will say the only thing this eye cream did for me was hydrate my under eyes. As far as it reducing dark spots or fine lines i didn't see.  If you suffer from dry under eyes this is a must have for you. At least worth getting a sample!\n",
      "Line2186: This product is so nice and light, but really gets the job done without irritating my sensitive eyes. I use this every night before bed and have noticed that my under eyes seem so much more refreshed. I love this product and will definitely be repurchasing.\n",
      "Line2187: Really nice product that definitely helps dry eyes. Very gentle and creamy. Also a really great price for the amount in the tub. This product would probably be best for people in their 20s that are just starting to use an eye cream. Beautiful packaging.\n",
      "Line2188: Super easy to use and work into your skin. I have oily skin and this product definitely works wonders for me. Leaves my skin moisturized without looking greasy.\n",
      "Line2189: This has been my favorite eye cream. I had dry flaky skin on my lids and used this eye cream in my morning and nightly routine. After 2 days my dry patches were gone and under eye fine lines less noticeable!\n",
      "Line2190: I love this eye cream so much. I have really dry, sensitive under eyes so this is a night time must for me. I’ve been using it for over a year and would highly recommend.\n",
      "Line2191: I received a sample size of this eye cream in an ipsy bag a few months ago and I LOVE it. My under eye area gets dry very easily, especially when I wear concealer more than 3x a week. I put this on at night after I wash my face and it's lightweight enough to not feel greasy but delivers so much hydration that I have been able to see a visible difference in the skin in as little as a couple of weeks\n",
      "Line2192: OMG! This cream is amazing! I ultra moisturizer, light and smell super good!! I bought the travel size and I can’t wait to buy the full size!! I loved it!!\n",
      "Line2193: I’ve been using this for months and months. It’s really is moisturizing and nice. I have haven’t had dry skin under my eyes or around my eyes in ages. I don’t really feel like it does anything for fine lines or wrinkles, but it’s a good moisturizing eye cream.\n",
      "Line2194: Love love love this product I got it to pair with their moisturized and I now I cant live without it , it is a little on the pricey side but I always reccomend paying more for your skincare ! It's very effective and has made my under eyes more hydrated and brightened !\n",
      "Line2195: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is my absolute favorite! Since I started using it it has lightened my dark circles and has improved the overall look of my under eyes. I love it!\n",
      "Line2196: Its the in name! It truly serves its purpose and does a great job in ensuring my eyes stay moisturized through all seasons. I find myself using this porduct over and over again! It makes me feel light and more bright when its needed :) its a must try!\n",
      "Line2197: Really hydrating and moisturizing eye cream - I use it in my AM and PM routines and noticed a difference in how “fresh” and “awake” my eyes look.\n",
      "Line2198: I just started using this one. It’s really moisturizing and my wrinkles and dark circles do look better. I would highly recommend.\n",
      "Line2199: It definitely does its job at moisturizing your eyes, but that’s about it. I’m sure you could find eye creams that do more for less. It does come with a lot of product compared to most other brands so it’s still a pretty good value.\n",
      "Line2200: I am obsessed with this belief moisturizing eye bomb! It is so hydrating and smooth on the skin. I suffer from dry under eyes and I apply this twice a day in the morning and night, I have noticed a huge change in my under eye, less dry and no puffiness. This is a must have for all skin types!\n",
      "Line2201: The feel of this product is positively delightful; lightweight, slightly cool-feeling, spreads very easily. As someone in their mid-30s, I am looking for something with some wrinkle-fighting power and sadly, this isn’t it. It does a dynamite job hydrating, but did not notice wrinkle fighting or lifting power.\n",
      "Line2202: Love this to death!! Gonna need more soon, you can tell the second you put it on that's it's good! I love it so much, I bought the face moisturizing bomb, which was pretty pricey, but that's how much faith I have in this brand.\n",
      "Line2203: This is a really great eye cream for hydration, but I suggest only wearing it at night because it’s very thick and takes a long time to soak in. I live in a very cold dry climate in the winter time and they’re saved my eye area. I will definitely be re-purchasing this every winter and I highly recommend it for people who live in really cold places.\n",
      "Line2204: I love this eye cream. It really smooth the under eyes. Very moisturized. A little bit goes along way.\n",
      "Line2205: I wanted this product to be my solution for dark circles, but after finishing the sample size, I can honestly say that I do not see a difference in the appearance of my dark circles. It's moisturizing and refreshing, but that's about it. I will not be buying the full size.\n",
      "Line2206: Ohhhh... I love Aqua Bomb and wanted to like this so much!  I ordered it as soon as it came out, and after using it for awhile, I can only work up an unenthusiastic \"meh\" when reviewing it.  Let me start by saying my under -eye area is dry and I use Retin-A.  So....I need a really rich moisturizer.  This feels good when applied, but quickly dries up on me after just a few minutes.  Then my under -eye area feels like I have applied nothing.  And, when using under concealer.... forget it.  My concealer creases pretty badly.  That being said, if you don't require alot of lasting moisture, this may work great for you.  I am going back to my Sheseido Benefiance.  Ugh!  SO EXPENSIVE!\n",
      "Line2207: AH-MA-ZING. I had really liney under eyes. I'm young and smile a lot, I don't know how many I had for sure but dang. I've been using a sample of this for about a month or two, and I pretty much have no fine lines under either eye now. It's so moisturizing and plumps them up too!\n",
      "Line2208: I bought this eye cream about a week ago. I was excited to use it based on all the good reviews. And best believe this product is worth the hype! I have a few fine lines under my eye and VERY sensitive skin so I was slightly concerned that I wouldn’t be able to use this product because I can’t use most products because they break me out. But this didn’t! Also, my fine lines are fading and my skin is very hydrated. Definitely a must buy.\n",
      "Line2209: I’ve actually haven’t used eye creams much before so I didn’t know what to expect but WOW. This product is so hydrating and I actually noticed a difference within just a few days. It’s lightweight too so it feels amazing on the skin and you just need a tiny amount.\n",
      "Line2210: This is the best eye cream I have ever tried. It’s so moisturizing and light. I use it twice a day as my skin area around eyes gets dry a lot and looks excessively wrinkly. It does a great job moisturizing the area and therefore minimizing the wrinkles.\n",
      "Line2211: One of the best eye creams I have ever used! I use this nightly because it is kind of thick, but that is why it’s amazing to use overnight for me. I wake up with the most refreshed eyes and they are so hydrated, I sometimes struggle with dry under eyes and this has changed the game for me. Holy grail product!!!\n",
      "Line2212: I always use this one my eyes after Botox injections. It is soothing and doesn’t get sticky. It’s a good, basic eye cream. It hydrates even the most sensitive of eyes without irritation or residue. It’s a staple for creaseless concealer application.\n",
      "Line2213: Recently I purchased the a Belif skincare set at Sephora one of the items in the set was theBelif Moisturizing Eye Balm. I LOVE this product I can't emphasize it enough. This cream is not too heavy or light it has the perfect consistency. I have normal / slightly dry skin this absorbs quickly into the skin. Be careful not to get it in your eyes it will BURN!\n",
      "Line2214: My holy grail eye cream! I use it every morning and it really hydrates my under eyes and helps with any puffiness I may have.\n",
      "Line2215: A good product for the eye care. Since im using it I feel my eyes less dry and with less rides. The packaging its nice, but it's really big, there is not full of cream. I also love the smell and sensation it gives to my eye skin. I really recommend this product.\n",
      "Line2216: Been looking for an eye cream forever that won’t be too greasy or heavy, but will also actually do something. This one is it! I know it is impossible for a cream to really help undereye circles but for keeping that area moisturized this is fab.\n",
      "Line2217: Didn’t do anything for my dark circles, hydrating but that was all. I think it’s a great product for anyone looking for hydration!\n",
      "Line2218: I really wanted to love this product I felt like it made my under eyes hydrated however it gave me tiny white dots under my eyes so I had to stop using it which was super disappointing I wish it didn’t clog my poors\n",
      "Line2219: I use the Moisturizing Eye Bomb in my nightly routine and love it. I apply a layer under each eye after the AHA/serum portion of my nightly routine to help prevent irritation or dryness in my under eye area. The extra moisture really helps minimize my fine lines and textural issues.\n",
      "Line2220: So moisturizing under the eye! It sets quickly too so it’s great to wear under makeup to help your concealer go on and stay on even and smooth\n",
      "Line2221: I must say that this eye bomb is definitely hydrating, i only got the mini sample one and i cant stop using it, i’ll definitely for sure buy the big one once im done with my mini sample. Definitely 100% recommend it.\n",
      "Line2222: Nice moisturizing product.  I received a deluxe sample in a subscription box.  Didn't provide any other benefits that I noticed.\n",
      "Line2223: I have never been an eye cream lover as the ones I've tried have felt heavy and oily. But THIS ONE. This is the one. The holy grail. I use it with my  belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb and it is a match made in heaven. Extremely cooling and light, and instantly de-puffs. 100% worth the money!\n",
      "Line2224: Yes! This eye cream goes on light but keeps your eyes hydrated. I have very puffy and dry undereye and this performs very well. This is a staple item for me.\n",
      "Line2225: This eye cream is amazing. SO moisturizing and it lasts forever! 10/10 would buy again.\n",
      "Line2226: Received it in my shepora monthly subscription sample. Very cooling feeling! Loved how smoothly it glides on. Not a thick consistency very light.\n",
      "Line2227: You guys really need to try this BOMB! I use this to moisturize my eye area before my makeup and it works amazing. Love the packaging, good price, it works very good! My concealer is always in place it gives a natural look an long lasting  ❤️\n",
      "Line2228: I absolutely love this stuff! I started using this while on accutane because my skin and eye area got so dry. This helped a lot. I usually get milia from eye creams but not from this. I think the price is good because it lasts a very long time. I had a sample size which is the size of a penny, and an inch tall and it lasted me for months and months.\n",
      "Line2229: Whenever I used this eye cream at night I would wake up and feel very refreshed under my eyes but it doesn’t do much for discoloration under the eyes. I think it would be best used as a preventative treatment against wrinkles and to refresh your eyes but if you have any kind of more severe issues this wouldn’t be for you\n",
      "Line2230: This stuff is really bomb! I have extremely dry skin and even dryer under eyes which is why I almost never wear concealer but this stuff has really helped with that. It’s so juicy feeling haha I love this stuff\n",
      "Line2231: I seem to always come back to this eye cream. It feels really good on the skin and I’ve never had any problems with it.\n",
      "Line2232: This is probably the best eye cream I've tried.  I still have lines and dark circles, but it goes on smoothly and doesnt irritate my skin.  It's very moisturizing .\n",
      "Line2233: I love this eye cream. Its super moisturizing and it absorbs so quickly! It doesn’t leave any residue behind. I bought this product in last april and I haven’t had to repurchase yet. One little tub has lasted me an entire year.\n",
      "Line2234: It was moisturizing and had a nice feel, but it gave me some bumps on my eyes. It was disappointing because my under eye area felt sensitive after using it a few times.\n",
      "Line2235: I love how this soaks into my skin. I get very dry right under my eyes, so I apply this 20 minutes before my makeup and it helps my concealer from creasing/looking dry. I would recommend this!\n",
      "Line2236: I really like how lightweight and moisturizing it is, especially under my eyes. It absorbed quickly and play very well with my make up. A favorite of mine last summer. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is just looking for an eye moisturizer that is lightweight and works under make up. Since I need more than just a moisturizer I have moved on from this product.\n",
      "Line2237: Really great product for simple hydration. It comes in a gel/water-like texture and a little bit of product goes a long way!\n",
      "Line2238: I have always been very dry underneath my eyes and my concealer would crease no matter what i did. This product has been a game changer. My concealer and skin has never looked better. I will definitely be re-purchasing.\n",
      "Line2239: Super moisturizing. You don’t need much product so it lasts a really long time. It did a good job in moisturizing\n",
      "Line2240: This product is definitely water based and you can tell when you apply it. It’s very light on the skin and absorbs quickly. I like using it at night before I go to bed. Be careful to not put it too close to the actual eye because it can irritate your eyeball if it gets in it.\n",
      "Line2241: This is a great product for its price. It's definitely hydrating because my eye area feels so happy after using. With some eye creams, it still feels tight and dry or the cream is sticky, but this applies smoothly, absorbs quickly, and is definitely hydrating for this desert girl!\n",
      "Line2242: This is the bomb of eye creams. Just saying. Its so hyrdrating and awakes my eyes and senses. I will definitely repurchase this again.\n",
      "Line2243: I like this eye cream. Love thr smell and texture. It provides a decent amount of hydration but i am getting to the age where i need a bit more than just hydration in my under eye area. I did not feel like it provided any benefit to deep under eye wrinkles. Would recommend this product for someone really only wanting to target hydration of the under eye area.\n",
      "Line2244: After trying many eye creams for years I've finally found the one that works for me. This really gets the job done. It hydrates, primes, depuffs, and lessen fine lines. My concealer goes on much smoother when I have this on my eyes. This is the only eye cream that really absorbs into my skin when applied, not like other creams that would just sit on the skin. It's very light formula and only need tiny bit. Use it for Am and PM. It's a #musthave in my #skincareroutine\n",
      "Line2245: Feels hydrating, but I haven't noticed any big change. I have sensitive skin, so it's gentle and doesn't sting. I'd buy again!\n",
      "Line2246: This product is amazing I have the worst under eye circles and this cream has helped moisturize my eye continuously. I love the belief products and I highly recommend using them!\n",
      "Line2247: I refrigerate this. I like this product a lot, it feels moisturizing and goes on nicely. A little pricey in my opinion but is a good product. I use it morning and night, it helps wake you up in the morning if you refrigerate.\n",
      "Line2248: I really loved this when I first used it because it is really moisturizing, but over time it didn't diminish signs of aging and that is what I'm looking for in an eye cream now that I'm in my 30's. If you are looking for something just super moisturizing, this is it. If you want anti-aging I would choose another product.\n",
      "Line2249: I absolutely love this eye moisturizer. It is moisturizing without being greasy. It has a very light velvety feel.\n",
      "Line2250: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb I received this in a beauty box and have to say like all the other belif products I have tried I am really enjoying the quality of this product. It goes on so smoothly and feels deeply hydrating and silky in texture without being too heavy or oily feeling.  Quite unique.. Never tried another eye product like this... Would defo consider repurchasing.\n",
      "Line2251: Definitely moisturizing. I little goes a very long way with this eye cream. Keeps my under eyes nice and moisturized all night long. I do feel like it helps with the fine lines I have but I’m not sure about my dark circles.\n",
      "Line2252: Amazing product. Works really well to hydrate your under eye area. I don't think it lasts the whole timeframe that they state because I do end up putting some more on later in the day. However, I'm in Wisconsin and the cold weather does dry my skin out pretty badly.\n",
      "Line2253: It’s My favorite running eye cream. It goes very smooth with concealer. no under eye milia problem with this product, otherwise I faced this problem with other products.\n",
      "Line2254: I love this product it keeps your eye super moisturized and helps with puffiness. I recommend this to my best friend as well\n",
      "Line2255: Works amazing! My eyes immediately felt so hydrated. I not only looked awake, I felt awake. A little goes a long way so the price tag is not an issue. It’s a worthy investment.\n",
      "Line2256: This is a nice moisturizing eye cream. O have not noticed any other benefits, but it has a nice weight and wears well under makeup.\n",
      "Line2257: I love this line of products! This one in particular gives a good amount of hydration under the eyes. I like to use it before I apply makeup to avoid dryness throughout the day. For an extra bonus, pop it in the fridge so it remains cool and refreshing!\n",
      "Line2258: Eye cream is super lightweight, hydrates the under eye but it does not leave an oily feeling. Formula absorbs fast into the skin wich makes it perfect before makeup and helps the concealer to look amazing.\n",
      "Line2259: I received this as a sample from Sephora. I have been using this every night before my moisterizer and it really hydrates my undereye area. It has no fragrance and a light formula. I think it would play well under makeup. I use something different in the am. I will purchase the full sized version when my sample is gone. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Line2260: This eye cream is wonderful. It's not too heavy and is not heavily fragranced. Soaks right in and leaves the skin around your eye so soft.\n",
      "Line2261: I received a sample for this and loved it so much, I have it to my mother and bought the full size for myself. It's wonderful! So creamy, moisturizing and soothing. But it's not heavy at all--just like the rest of the line. Great stuff that I definitely recommend\n",
      "Line2262: It doesn’t NOT work but I expected better hydration from the product. My eyes got really dry this winter and this was not a good solution for that.\n",
      "Line2263: I love this bomb. It’s super hydrating and makes a great base for under eye concealer once it’s fully absorbed.\n",
      "Line2264: Always \"believed\" in my belif products! Got a sample of this from Sephora and brought it with me on my travel to Japan. Since then, I've been using this and I bring it with me on my trips. Extremely moisturizing and love the scent. I combine using it with my belif face moisturizer. Overall, a great product!\n",
      "Line2265: This eye cream is so cooling and great for early mornings when you feel a lot of puffiness. It's a gel-cream formula so it's a bit lighter but my undereyes always feel moisturized. You do need a little extra during wintertime though, I find.\n",
      "Line2266: The formula is very refreshing and keeps the under eyes quenched and hydrated. It is a water based formula so it is not too heavy on the eyes and gives a smooth finish. The jar goes a very long way and it’s worth the money. I have not noticed the product reduce discoloration however it does keep the area refreshed and bright. I would definitely recommend!\n",
      "Line2267: This saved my eye skin, which was getting so dry it was painful. I use it under my eye and also on the lids and it keeps my delicate eye skin soft and supple and looking younger. So worth the price, which is reasonable to begin with.\n",
      "Line2268: I really like this product! Definitely hydrates and extremely gentle on my sensitive skin! A product that does what it says it will, absolute plus!\n",
      "Line2269: This product smells light and pleasant, it isn't too heavy or greasy and helps to minimize fine lines and wrinkles. I haven't been using this cream for very long so I am eager to see the results from regular use.\n",
      "Line2270: It does a good job moisturizing, but I don’t see much improvement in any other way. It has a more watery consistency than most eye creams. I think this eye cream is best suited for younger skin and not those in need of wrinkle reducing or dark circles.\n",
      "Line2271: I got this as sample in my Sephora Playbox then bought a full size after I finished it. This cream is most effective when it is put in the fridge! IT WORKS SO MUCH BETTER!!! It is definitely good for puffiness but not much effectiveness for dark circles, which is why I'm giving 3 stars.\n",
      "Line2272: Received a sample of this recently and will probably be purchasing the full size! Worked well,  just was slightly slick under my concealer!\n",
      "Line2273: I was pleasantly surprised by the belif Eye Bomb. I got a sample of it from Sephora not thinking I was going to feel any particular way about it. I've used a few other belif products and enjoyed them a lot, so I shouldn't have been surprised by how creamy and moisturizing the Eye Bomb was. Normally my 'low-end' eye cream is Fresh Black Tea and my absolute favorite eye cream is by Cle de Peau which is uber-pricey, so I was pleasantly surprised to find an eye cream I liked that was even more reasonably priced!\n",
      "Line2274: I love most every Belif product I've tried, and this is one of my favorite eye creams. It's lightweight and not greasy, but it provides and impressive amount of moisture. I smooth it on both under my eyes and on my eyelids, but I never have problems with it creasing in conjunction with concealer or eye shadows. I don't have issues with puffiness, but I do find that it helps soften my skin and seems to help keep the appearance of fine lines at bay. I really adore the light herbal scent that Belif uses in their products, including this one. A solid eye cream within it's category.\n",
      "Line2275: Love this belif moisturizing eye bomb. Feels really rich and smooth going on and it's so moisturizing - it feels like a tall drink of water for my eyes. Definitely on the creamy/heavy side but that works well for me. Pairs well with the moisturizer.\n",
      "Line2276: I have extremely sensitive skin, especially on my face and even more so around my eyes which makes me tend to be nervous whenever trying a new eye cream, I had zero issues with this one though! I really like the gel texture and would repurchase.\n",
      "Line2277: I had a small sample from Sephora and I'm still currently using it. It's effective, but still not what I'm looking for. It burns my under eye area when I apply it, but I also have very sensitive skin. Moisturizes the area well, though. I won't purchase this for myself.\n",
      "Line2278: One of the better eye creams I have tried. I do have to say though it is not for dark circles but otherwise it is amazing for the texture under the eye, smoothing and plumping.\n",
      "Line2279: Got this in a travel pack! A little bit goes a very long way. It’s really gentle on the under eyes but I don’t think I’ve noticed any difference. Good old value for the price since the product can last you long\n",
      "Line2280: I freaking love this eye cream. I've been having a really bad come with my under eye skin being super dry lately, and this stuff turned that right around. The texture is great, it feels soothing on the skin, and I definitely noticed a huge change in the hydration in that area. Love it.\n",
      "Line2281: I love this product! I got it as a sample size  from Sephora (for 100 points). I ended up getting 2. I was worried because the Sephora skincare consultant told me that she had a bad reaction to it because she’s allergic to an ingredient in it but I decided to give it a try any way because I want something hydrating. It’s definitely hydrating and goes on smoothly. Doesn’t leave an oily residue or film on the skin. It also works well under concealer. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it doesn’t claim to address any other skin concern but dryness and for the price point I’d rather buy a product that addresses multiple concerns.\n",
      "Line2282: I am addicted to their face moisturizer and was delighted to try the eye cream. Gentle, calming, smoothing.  I’m not quite sure it does enough to merit the price, but more active ingredients usually make my eyes water.\n",
      "Line2283: I’ve been using this product for a couple of months now and I’ve seen a difference. My under eyes no longer feel so dry very hydrating. I sometimes even put this around my nose because I can get very dry in that area\n",
      "Line2284: This is one of the best eye creams I’ve found. I have dry, sensitive under eyes and this is perfect. My other two favorites are from amorepacific and La Mer, but this is comparable and is the most affordable of the three.\n",
      "Line2285: Absolutely love this!  One of my favorite eye creams!  I will be repurchasing!  This was my first time using it & I found the formula to be light, cool & gentle.  It is comparable in price to other prestige brands.\n",
      "Line2286: Believe the hype! This products works wonders. I’ve noticed the puffiness I’ve had has been improved. Helps keep my under eye area well moisturized.\n",
      "Line2287: I LOVE this, I love how moisturizing it is on my under eyes. It really prevents crepiness, especially with makeup. I find that it really helps my concealer look smooth and even under my eyes. Would recommend to a friend!\n",
      "Line2288: OMG, I love this stuff! It is like a tall drink of water for my under eyes. It feels so good, and seems to smooth out my fine lines a bit.\n",
      "Line2289: I love the Aqua Bomb, I love the Hungarian water, and the gel oil and this is no different. I don’t think I’ve ever disliked a Belief product so far.\n",
      "Line2290: When it comes to the skin around my eyes, I have to be super careful about sensitivity. The belief eye bomb is literally my saving grace. My under eyes are ALWAYS dry, and this cream helps with that tremendously. A little goes a LONG way, so the price point is worth it for the benefits.\n",
      "Line2291: Love love love love this stuff! It is so hydrating under the eye and a little goes a long way. I got the small sample size from Sephora points and it lasted me almost a month! So spending your money On the big size is totally worth it! It has helped my fine lines under my eyes when I apply twice a day.\n",
      "Line2292: Haven’t used this for that long but I do like the texture and moisture it brings. I do feel it plumps my skin but I think I’m using too much because I’ve been noticing it has been pilling on my skin. It could be a mixture of serums as well so I have to play around and maybe use it and night . Anyone else having this issue? I do like it so far. Just wanna play with it more.\n",
      "Line2293: I love this! It didn't burn my eyes which is a miracle because half the eye surums and moisturizers out there do! I used the whole little jar that I got because it hydrated my eyes really well and helped with some eylid flaking that I'm prone too. I haven't bought a full size because of the price yet but I probably would some day . I didn't see any results as far as helping with fine lines or puffiness or any of that but it is very thick and hydrating and not irratating at all .\n",
      "Line2294: Love this product! It delicately moisturizes my under eyes and makes them feel and look very hydrated in the morning.\n",
      "Line2295: Very hydrating for the under eye area!! Nice packing and easy to travel with. I have very dry under eye areas and it helps keep my concealer looking nice and fresh not cakey! Doesn’t do too much for brightening but excellent for hydration\n",
      "Line2296: The best eye cream I’ve tried so far. Application is nice and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. A little goes a long way so the jar will last a while.\n",
      "Line2297: One of the best eye cream/moisturizers I have ever tried. I have very dry under eyes and this stuff was amazing. It’s a thick clear gel like consistency but it definitely moisturizes. It was also great under my makeup and make my concealer slide right on. I highly recommend and will be repurchasing when I can.\n",
      "Line2298: Only eye cream I’ll ever use now ! It’s so moisturizing and gentle on my skin which is super sensitive. It isn’t too expensive and it’s lasts so long , worth the price.\n",
      "Line2299: I love how soft my skin is after this product! It doesn't make me more oily, and gives a great base under my makeup. I am a frequent user of these products and I really enjoy the smell and packaging. I have not been disappointed by any Belif product\n",
      "Line2300: Extremely hydrating on the eyes. It layers well under my make up which I was happy about. because many eye creams I have previously used do not layer well with my make up. I like how it is a gel formula because it feels very refreshing on the skin to really plump it up.\n",
      "Line2301: I just recently bought this product and I already love it so much. The formula is so moisturizing. I love it so much\n",
      "Line2302: Got it as a sample size once, so not a repeat user. Liked the formula but didn’t last super long. Kind of a waxy texture— nice that it wasn’t too creamy or watery but might not be for everyone! Got the job done but not convinced it’s life-changing!\n",
      "Line2303: This is a great eye cream. It has diminished my under eye wrinkles decently. It’s not a “magic” product by any means. However it makes the under eye feel moisturized over all looks/feels better. I recommend to only use this at night. It does take a long time to soak in, so I wouldn’t recommend using before makeup. Overall, I like it!\n",
      "Line2304: I love this! It helps keep my undereye looking bright and takes away dullness. Provides adequate moisture without being greasy.\n",
      "Line2305: I love the way this eye cream feels when applying and the way it soaks into my skin. I’ll be 33 in a couple of months so I have some creases under and around my eye. This cream plumps my skin so well and leaves it so moist that I’m able to bake under my eyes without worrying about the creases being accentuated when makeup cakes in them.\n",
      "Line2306: I have been using this eye cream for over a year and absolutely love it. I use it at night and find that my eyes look more awake as opposed to when I don’t use it. I do find that I still have dark circles, however this cream is extremely moisturizing!\n",
      "Line2307: Love this eye cream so far. Very moisturizing and thick without irritating my eyes. I really like to put this moisturizer on before bed, and then when I wake up and put makeup on my under-eyes look and feel very hydrated and plump instead of dry and settling into fine lines.\n",
      "Line2308: I love this eye cream!!! I have a sample that has lasted for weeks because you only need a little product to obtain the necessary hydration. It's super moisturizing, absorbs quickly, leaves skin soft, does not irritate, feels good under makeup and the moisturizing effect has lasted all day even if I washed my face. I feel comfortable with this moisturizer, plus it brings a lot of product for the price. Honestly, I intend to buy this great product!!\n",
      "Line2309: This is a really great eye cream! I received a small sample size which lasted two weeks. I didn’t think I would be able to see results from such a small tub but I was shocked to see results! I have genetic deep eye bags that are purplish blue. After ten days I saw a huge difference in my under eyes. They were bright and not as puffy. While you can’t change genetics, this product certainly helps the under eye look great. Definitely worth the price !!!!!\n",
      "Line2310: BEST EYE CREAM! I fell in love with this eye bomb when I noticed how smooth my makeup went on above it. You need to try this product because you will not be disappointed.\n",
      "Line2311: It’s creamy but gel like at the same time. It really moisturizes my under eye. It gets the job done. And my makeup sits perfectly over it\n",
      "Line2312: I love this product it makes my under eyes less dry and look awake and decrease the fine lines\n",
      "Line2313: Loved the consistency! So creamy and felt like it would be super moisturizing but I didn’t see a huge difference around my eyes. I get very dry around my eyes and this did not do the trick. Great smell too but not for extra dry eyes.!\n",
      "Line2314: Obsessed with this product! I have trouble with insomnia and get eye bags easily but this product does wonders. It is a bit pricey but a staple piece in my skincare routine.\n",
      "Line2315: Best eye cream for dry eyes. After continuous, my eyelids no longer flake because of this product. The formula is lightweight and q little goes a long way. This is pricey for an eye cream, but it's worth every penny. I just wish the container was in a pump with an applicator, so that it would be easy to apply.\n",
      "Line2316: Oh my gosh!! This was recommended to me at Sephora and I’m in love! I picked up a sample and saw results after the first couple days. I used to get the worst dry patches under and around my eyes that my foundation and concealer would cling too and look cakey no matter what I did. When I started using this it reduced the appearance of dryness a LOT. I want to go pick up the full size but the only downside is the price tag or I would have been on it immediately! But a little goes a long way so I would say this is worth the investment. It’s so soft too and makes my skin feel So good! I have to be careful what I put on my face considering I have combination Acne prone skin but this worked for me!!\n",
      "Line2317: I can't say if using this eye cream has made much of a difference because my eyes are not my trouble area, but I will say that this is a very soothing cream that seems to absorb well into my skin\n",
      "Line2318: Lifesaver. Game changer. Bag-breaker! Literally fixes under eye bags instantly and plumps up tired hangover eyes! On par with La Mer’s the eye concentrate/creme.\n",
      "Line2319: This product is lightweight and doesn't have any smells that would be unpleasant. It does have one of those fool packages though - a small container disguised as a larger one. It definitely hydrates, but I can't tell if it's a historically different change than when I began using it.\n",
      "Line2320: Purchased early December it does what it promises, very moisturizing. Can’t give a full opinion on it since I haven’t been using it regularly.\n",
      "Line2321: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is instantly hydrating and soothing. After trying many other brands, I've settled on this product because it is quickly absorbed and restored my dry skin during the cold winter. Ive even noticed a reduction in lines around my eyes.\n",
      "Line2322: This is a very moisturizing eye cream that keeps my undereye moisturized all day and doesn’t crepe under concealer at all. Great value for the price. I look forward to trying other products from this brand. So far everything I’ve tried has been top notch.\n",
      "Line2323: I can’t honestly tell if this works because it burns my eyes. I feel like it never penetrates my eye area and moves around. I do like the packaging it’s attractive, but I’m disappointed & wouldn’t buy again.\n",
      "Line2324: This is the most hydrating under eye cream I’ve ever used. I use this day and night and I can always tell when I don’t use it religiously. It is a bit pricey but I think it is totally worth every penny.\n",
      "Line2325: This stuff is the most moisturizing product I've found in a LONG time. It works so well. I use it on my eyes everyday twice a day and even on dry patches on other places on my face when needed. My eyes are significantly more moisturized when I keep up with this routine and I can definitely tell how much dryer they are when I forget to use this. I will be buying this over and over again for a while.\n",
      "Line2326: This eye cream is amazing.  It immediately adds intense hydration to my eye area.  It truly moisturizes my skin and makes it feel plump and bouncy.  It is gentle and the formula is not sticky.  The product absorbs quickly and it comes in an adorable blue jar.  I am already in the process of repurchasing it.\n",
      "Line2327: I have tried this in the past a few times when it came in a kit with my belief true cream for my day time eye cream. This eye cream seems to really moisturize the under eye area and I would recommend it.\n",
      "Line2328: It was not as good as I hoped. I liked the texture but it doesn’t seem to absorb well so I didnt see it making much of a difference.\n",
      "Line2329: This is my daily eye moisturizer. I love it. It’s a great price and works great. I’ve tried so many, but this is definitely one of my favorites. It always makes my concealer look amazing!\n",

      "Line2333: Super moisturizing, and a great base for concealer. Keeps my undereyes hydrated and keeps concealer looking great all day. Still young so I use as a precautionary product, so can’t speak to reduction of fine lines.\n",
      "Line2334: I love this line from belif, but I do admit the eye cream is my least favorite product. It seems like it’s not as concentrated as I prefer. The scent also makes my eyes water a little bit, but nothing bad. It’s not a bad product at all, but there are eye creams I like better.\n",
      "Line2335: If you love the aqua bomb moisturizer, you will love this! It’s like a drink of water for my under eyes. You only need the tiniest bet and it layer nicely under my concealer without it moving around.\n",
      "Line2336: Yasssss!! By far the best eye cream I have used! I’ve worked in skin care for many years and I don’t think there’s anything on the market that compares! Great smell! Super moisturizing! Helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles instantly!\n",

The undereye cream is thick with immediate results. Its extremely moisturizing and soothing. The smell is amazing as well.  The 0.84 fl oz bottle retails for 48$... its very pricey, but worth it!

      "Line2493: Works really well for under the eyes very hydrating and I love using this every morning and night. Very effective !\n",
      "Line2494: I got a sample size to try of Belif Moisturizing Bomb. Packaging was standard for eye cream. It had a nice fresh scent. I found it to be a little tacky after I applied it, but my eyes felt refreshed. I would try a variation of Belif’s eye creams again.\n",
      "Line2495: Sometimes I wake up feeling my eyes look tired but when I use this I can see the difference\n",
      "Line2496: At first when I started using this product it definitely helps with moisture under the eyes but ghasnt really done much for the lines under my eyes\n",
      "Line2497: This is scentless and comes in an easy to open plastic jar. The formula soaks into your skin and helps wake up your eyes. Over time it will help to minimize wrinkles. The directions say to use morning and night so that is what I do. I would definitively recommend this for an eye cream.\n",
      "Line2498: I love this stuff! I think itsthe higher end version of neutrogena’s hydrating under  eye cream. it feels very lush and gel-like under the eyes. i would buy again. it also is hydrating and smells pleasant!\n",
      "Line2499: This is very hydrating and does not leave any residue. It does not feel heavy. I find that it does smooth out my creases\n",
      "Line2500: Love this eye cream. Not too heavy. Very hydrating. I’m glad I tried this and will repurchase again.\n",
      "Line2501: Super light weight yet it still hydrates my under eyes! I’ve noticed that my fine lines underneath my eyes are not at noticeable either.\n",
      "Line2502: I absolutely love Belief products. Have used Aqua Bomb since it came out, so I had to give this a shot and I was not disappointed\n",
      "Line2503: Love love love this product!!! It’s part of my daily routine and I can’t live without it! I think it’s well worth the price and works very well on my dry skin during the winter. Currently travelling and had to bring my mini size with me!\n",
      "Line2504: This is def bomb! Just like the name! Locks in moistures and soaks in the skin! Belif products does not disappoint. Love that it’s light weight and does not have a heavy fragrance. My skin is a bit sensitive but belif products does a great job always!\n",
      "Line2505: Hydrating, cooling, and not to thick! Everything you could want in a under eye moisturizer\n",
      "Line2506: Keeps your under eyes looking fresh! Got this in the Merry Moisturizer kit and i love it!\n",
      "Line2507: i do agree that this is the most moisturizing and hydrating eye cream i have EVER used, and hydrated under eyes means no circles or crows feet around the eyes so this helps with that a lot. HOWEVER....it doesn’t help with dark circles and puffiness which is a major concern of mine. it is good, just doesn’t meet up to the expectations i wanted. i do think it’s great if you don’t have those problems and just want really moisturized undereyes however.\n",
      "Line2508: Hydrating. I love using it under my concealer it makes the area smooth and ready for makeup. It’s in the pricey side, so keep an eye on it during sales.\n",
      "Line2509: I received a sample with my online order from Sephora about a month ago - and I'm SO happy I did! I finally found an eye \"cream\" (this looks and feels different from your average cream) that isn't gooey or too creamy, and doesn't get into my eyes or irritate them - I have very sensitive skin and my eyes would get a red rim on the lower lash line with other eye products, but not this one! If you've had similar issues and are looking for something that actually hydrates (and well!) then you should definitely give this a try!\n",
      "Line2510: Absolutely love! Keeps my under eyes hydrated and firm without making my skin greasy! Perfect for daytime and nighttime\n",
      "Line2511: This is the only eye cream I’ve ever used and it’s what got me started with the brand belif. I love the water based formula, it absorbs so we’ll and makes my skin feel really light and refreshed. Being that I’m young I don’t have anything under my eyes but I really believe using this will keep my under eye area healthy and smooth!\n",
      "Line2512: I have mixed feelings about this product I wanted to love it but it was just meh. I felt like it never absorbed into my skin no matter how little I used it was always wet.\n",
      "Line2513: I have used many I products over the years and I have really grown to like this product a lot. It keeps my eyes from looking crepey and also cuts down on the look of Fine Lines around my eyes\n",
      "Line2514: So much moisture! A tiny bit gently dabbed on your under eye truly goes a long way . It’s great for overnight or during the day. It’s nice and cooling so it’s good for depuffing I’m the morning prior to makeup\n",
      "Line2515: I'm a believer now! Unfortunately, it's a bit outside my price range to continuously purchase this. It is so effective for under eye dryness and discoloring. In the morning, my under eyes feel firm and hydrated.\n",
      "Line2516: It is a pretty light moisturizer that lasts you quite a long time, you only need a small pea size amount and apply it with your ring finger. I use it morning and night after cleansing my face and also before putting any makeup on to keep my under eyes hydrated.\n",
      "Line2517: Imagine...as you get older you get wrinkles!  I havent been good to my skin over the years (58)  but now is my time!  I am trying different products and reading alot about skin care. I like this eye bomb and wish I had taken an interest in eye care in my 20's. I have not used this bomb enough to give more info.\n",
      "Line2518: I am new to this product and I absolutely LOVE IT. Its sooo hydrating and moisturizing on my dry sensitive eye area especially in the winter! It feels so soothing on my skin. No greasy feeling. Absolutely recommend!\n",
      "Line2519: I absolutely love this product, it is by far one of the best products I've tried. It is a fantastic Moisturizer and helped with dark spots under my eyes.\n",
      "Line2520: I am huge \"belifer\". All of their products are flawless. This does exactly what its suppose to do and makes my eyes feel great and well rested.\n",
      "Line2521: It feels amazing and cool when applied. It absorbs very quickly and is very hydrating. I got a sample and will be getting the full size soon.\n",
      "Line2522: I got this as a free sample from Sephora and now I’m investing in the full size! This product is definitely hydrating - especially after a night on the town. This product makes my eyes look bright and helps with my dark circles!\n",
      "Line2523: I’m definitely a belifer 💦 This under eye cream is amazing. It’s packed with moisture and absorbs quickly. It doesn’t leave your skin feeling greasy or it has a fresh smell. A little of the product goes a looong way.\n",
      "Line2524: I really really love this eye product! It is so light and not greasy at all and a little dot goes a long way. I applied this eye bomb before my concealer and powder. And when I did apply my makeup, it went on smoothly and my puffiness was diminished. My wrinkles were not noticeable. The best thing is that my eyes are not irritated or teary. This product is worth  the money I spent, $48.00. It may be pricey but I am not complaining.\n",
      "Line2525: This is hands down the best eye cream you can try! Fine lines, dark circles, puffiness completely gone. Apply before bed, and wake up completely transformed.\n",
      "Line2526: I think this eye cream is fabulous. In the past other products have given me tiny bumps around my eyes but this hasn't. It is super moisturizing and luxurious. My makeup even seems to sit smoother and nicer under my eyes. I love this stuff and need to order another as mine is starting to get low!\n",
      "Line2527: This is a really nice eye cream to help plump and hydrate the under eye. It is a nice gel like consistency that really helps to draw in moisturizer, and does an amazing job smoothing fine lines and puffiness under makeup.\n",
      "Line2528: Hands down my favorite eye cream! Leaves my under eye feeling hydrated and smooth. It's very lightweight and a little goes a long way!\n",
      "Line2529: For the money I really enjoy this eye cream. My skin is dry and this is incredibly moisturizing.  I first received this in my play box and decided to buy after I used the sample.\n",
      "Line2530: I received it as a sample and after using it I was completely convinced to buy it as a full sized product. It’s extremely hydrating.\n",
      "Line2531: Very moisturizing under eye cream. I apply this every night to the entire eye area and again in the morning with another eye cream if my eyes are extra dry. It really helps prevent flaking and diminishes the look of fine lines - even after makeup application! The formula is lightweight, non-greasy, and applies like a dream. Although it’s described as a cream, it feels more like a gel. There is subtle, fresh scent and a pleasant cooling sensation upon application. This really is a value product because you get so much in the jar (25 ml) and only need a pea size amount to cover the entire eye area. I don’t see myself running out any time soon but I will definitely re-buy when I do!\n",
      "Line2532: Only thing that keeps my under eyes from looking dry and cracking!! super hydrating and makeup applies beautifully over top\n",
      "Line2533: Keeps my eyes feeling awake and moisturized without being heavy. Would recommend to any skin type.\n",
      "Line2534: This is my favorite eye cream to wear on my no makeup days. It is perfect for winter. Normally, the area under my eyes gets immensely dry and chapped in the winter, but I started wearing this in the winter at night and on my no makeup days, and I haven't experienced that at all! It is super creamy so if you do plan to wear it under makeup, make sure to wait at least 30 minutes while drinking some coffee or eating breakfast or something to let it absorb into the skin and dry down a bit. This will help prevent it belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb  from compromising your foundation.\n",
      "Line2535: I use this every night and my eye bags seem to look better finally LOL lack of sleep . But I love using this in the am and pm ! It’s great and belief is one of the best brands out there !\n",
      "Line2536: It’s ok. It does moisturize but I don’t see any other difference. So I’d rather not pay this much for something that does not have that much effect.\n",
      "Line2537: Great eye cream, doesn't interfere with concealer or other makeup application! It's a light, gel texture but surprisingly hydrating. Sinks into the skin quickly!\n",
      "Line2538: I really like this eye moisterizer better than most I've tried. At first it made my eyes look brighter but over time the effects have lessened.\n",
      "Line2539: I like this product and love the way it feels going on.  It's almost like a gel (which I really love around my eye area).  It did a good job of moisturizing, but I was really looking for a little more help from an eye cream.  I did not experience any sensitivity while using this product.\n",
      "Line2540: Have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and can’t say that I see a huge difference with my eyes but it is definitely super comfortable and hydrating! Will be purchasing again as it is one of the better kinds I’ve tried!\n",
      "Line2541: My favorite eye cream for the day time! It hydrates without being too heavy and my makeup glides on like a dream overtop\n",
      "Line2542: This is a wonderfully light formula that absorbs well into the skin. It’s perfect for morning routines as the finish is smooth and not sticky. This plumps the skin around my eyes, and this jar lasts for forever!\n",
      "Line2543: The price is affordable but I am not in love with this product. I would prefer a creamier eye cream. I use it for bed when I do use it.\n",
      "Line2544: I use this every single day before I go to sleep. This keeps my eyes from getting puffy in the morning, reduces the darkness under my eyes, and also keeps my fine lines hydrated while I sleep. It lasts the entire night and I wake up every morning still hydrated.\n",
      "Line2545: I love this eye cream. It’s definitely worth the price and a little goes a long way!\n",
      "Line2546: It made my skin flakey and dry. It also changed the texture for a while. I quit using it soon after I realized what the reason for these things were.\n",
      "Line2547: I got a sample size of this in a Sephora Play bag a few months ago and I just now got around to using/finishing it.  This is a nice eye cream and I really enjoyed using it. However I didn’t find it to be better than other eye products that I’ve used before so I’ll probably keep it moving and try out other creams versus purchasing the full size.\n",
      "Line2548: it’s great for what the name says it does. It’s very moisturizing but don’t look for it to help with under eye bags etc. but if you are looking for a moisturizer that’s safe and effective look no further.\n",
      "Line2549: I got this product because I love Belif Aqua Bomb moisturizer and this is a very similar formula. It applies like a nice water gel and doesn’t irritate my sensitive eyes. I would have given it 5 stars but it is a little thinner/lighter than I prefer my eye creams.\n",
      "Line2550: This stuff is good for puffyness and wrinkles but broke me out where I put it so I stopped using it. It’s too heavy for me I think.. I prefer lighter\n",
      "Line2551: I love this balm! It smells amazing and leaves my eyes moisturized without feeling too heavy. You get a good amount for the price.\n",
      "Line2552: this is the nicest eye cream i have ever tried!! SO SO hydrating, i apply it once a day and my undereyes look perfect (and not like i'm only getting 4 hours of sleep a night). it's expensive but lasts for so long.\n",
      "Line2553: I got this in a travel size when I bought another full sized belif product, and I was pleasantly surprised! It is very hydrating and it goes on well and absorbs into my skin without making it feel to thick. I’m definitely considering buying the full size when I run out\n",
      "Line2554: My end all be all eye cream! This is my holy grail eye cream. I have VERY dry, textured under eyes and this has made a huge difference in the appearance. I still can’t “bake” my under eye because of the dryness, but this cream has much such a significant difference! I always have a back up because I can’t go a day without it. For reference to see if this might work for you...other eye creams that work well for me are drunk elephant and it cosmetics bye bye under eye cream.\n",
      "Line2555: I honestly  fell in love with this product and the brand when I was having the worst skin year   Everything that I was putting on my face burn Except this product. It help me out  so much because my under eyes were so dry that I couldn’t even  wear concealer because it would just look all dry and patchy . this literally saved me I put this on right befor I go to sleep and wake up with flawless undereyes\n",
      "Line2556: This is okay. Feels light, doesn’t moisturize that well. Dries really quick. Smells great though!\n",
      "Line2557: This is one of the best eye creams out there!! It is much more affordable than other eye creams in sephora. It really moisturizes your under eye. It makes concealer applied under the eye look amazing and very healthy. I would recommend this eye to almost everyone since its also not too heavy.\n",
      "Line2558: This stuff is amazing! I use the face cream every day morning and night and this is part of my routine as well!\n",
      "Line2559: The eye bomb was very moisturizing and also cooling, so I felt that it de-puffed the under eye area well. The smell is very nice, and I love belif's packaging. I love jars for my under eye products because I can scoop my ring finger in easiest.\n",
      "Line2560: Oh boy I love this stuff, I got a sample size and it lasted me almost a whole year with consistent application. What I love about it is that it is not greasy and it helps my eyes stay moisturized. My mom is 52 and she said this helped with her crows feet. The best part is that it doesn’t leave little white bumps under my skin around my eyes. Also for the price, you are getting two times what you would get for a standard eye cream from a department store. Highly recommend!! I love belif.\n",
      "Line2561: feels smooth and light. I have sensitive skin, but this product works well for me and does not irritate my eyes.\n",
      "Line2562: I love this product so much. I honestly use it all over my face not just my eyes. It is VERY moisturizing but also doesn't make my skin oily. the only thing i will say is that a few minutes after you put it on it might make your skin feel a bit sticky until it absorbs. It is a little expensive but i would buy again.\n",
      "Line2563: Haven’t really notice a difference just yet, as I just started using it this week. It apply’s well, smooth and not tacky/sticky.\n",
      "Line2564: This worked so well! It made my under eye so smooth and soft and also helped get the wrinkles out from under my eyes! It also smells great! I would recommend using it!\n",
      "Line2565: I am now obsessed with this product. I've never really felt like I needed an under eye product (except I'm chronically tired so I do have some puff) so every time I tried one it was just disappointing and didn't do much for me. Once I tried this, I became a believer. This is so moisturizing, smoothing, depuffing, and lightweight! You don't need a lot which makes the price pretty worth it, because it does last a good while even if you use it daily! It has no smell or weird texture, just a simple eye cream that packs a great punch.\n",
      "Line2566: I use this eye cream nightly and keep it in the refrigerator so it feels nice and cool when I apply it.  I don't see any major difference other than my skin feeling nice and hydrated...but I don't think there are any other major benefits.  I don't think I would repurchase.\n",
      "Line2567: Seriously saw improvement with my under eye creasing overnight. I pair this with Vaseline during the winter months and it never disappoints. A definite HG purchase!\n",
      "Line2568: This product was GREAT!! It provided so much moisture to my under eyes it was phenomenal! The jar comes with a ton of product so I think it's definitely worth the higher price tag for an eye cream. The only drawback I have is that the packaging is so bulky, it's not all that great to travel with.\n",
      "Line2569: Ok so I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and i am obsessed! I apply at night and in the morning my eyes feel 10x less puffy and they are way more hydrated. It’s helped with creasing I’d make up in my under eyes which is something I’ve always struggled with! So amazing for real guys. Glad it lived up to the hype!\n",
      "Line2570: This feels absolutely amazing under my eyes! I have a very problematic under eye area and this helps to hydrate and gets rid of my fine lines. I only have a trial size of this but will definitely repurchase when I run out!\n",
      "Line2571: Excellent under eye product. Absorbs quickly! Lightweight but very moisturizing. Simple packaging. I’d repurchase again.\n",
      "Line2572: I absolutely love this I cream! It really moisturize my face and is soft to apply. I have noticed a more firm skin in my eyes.\n",
      "Line2573: I receive this from influenster for trial purposes. I have only skin and if I use during the day it can make my skin even oilier than usual, however, I learned that the best time to use it’s during nighttime. I apply prior going to bed and I wake up feeling reinvigorated.\n",
      "Line2574: This is a great product. I suffer from dry under eyes and this is very moisturizing. It is great worn alone or under makeup\n",
      "Line2575: Very soothing, cooling feeling, seemed to reduce eye bags slightly so would purchase again\n",
      "Line2576: This is probably my favorite eye cream that I have ever tried. I’m in my mid 20s so my main concerns are hydration and preventing wrinkles. This hydrates my under eyes really nicely and I can notice a difference in my skin when I don’t use this. The jar is worth the price because it lasts a long time since you only need a very small amount.\n",
      "Line2577: Está crema es muy buena para los ojos sobre todo cuando estoy cansada me ayuda a reducir el color oscuro de mis ojeras la recomiendo\n",
      "Line2578: A little greasy for daytime but great for nighttime use. I suffer from dry eyelids during the winter and this has helped immensely without burning like other eye creams have. Both my undereye and eyelids feel better and softer and less dry.\n",
      "Line2579: This product is amazing. It is extremely lightweight and very hydrating. I also like that it is not greasy.\n",
      "Line2580: I LOVE this product! The lightweight, gel-like texture feels great on your skin! It’s a nice change up from heavy moisturizing cremes!\n",
      "Line2581: I absolutely love Belif products and this product has become part of my nightly routine! I love how clean this feels, it's a gel-like texture but very water-like feeling. It's so easy to apply and blends like a dream and leaves your under eyes feeling nice and moisturized before bed! It is super affordable especially for the quality you are getting! If you're in the market for an amazing eye \"cream\" give this a try!\n",
      "Line2582: I love this eye cream! I got it in a monthly subscription box but I am definitely going to get a full size to purchase when this is out. I am at the age where I have fine lines so this is a great product to use.\n",
      "Line2583: A staple in my skincare routine! I apply at night and wake up feeling refreshed. It is gentle, has a mild smell and easily melts into your skin\n",
      "Line2584: Very great eye mask! Gentle and super hydrating. I love how I don’t need much of the product and it’s cooling on my eyes so it hydrates as well as reduces my eye bags.\n",
      "Line2585: This is an okay eye cream. Got a few samples in my Ulta order and used it for about a couple weeks. Didn't see any changes but I like that it was not too greasy and it didn't sting my eyes.\n",
      "Line2586: This was one of the first eye creams that I ever tried and I was in love. It is not harsh on the eyes and it’s very effective. The packaging is so nice. I dabbed my finger in there. You only need a tiny amount and you’re good. It gives so much moisture. It’s a definitely staple in your routine.\n",
      "Line2587: Bring my under eyes to life! My friends gave this to me because she knew I was having skin troubles and it was perfect timing!! This stuff is rich, yet refreshing and gives the skin plumpness. Love! Can’t wait to buy it for myself.\n",
      "Line2588: Very hydrating. Helps plump up the under eyes to make fine lines less visible. I got this in a set with their moisturizer which is my favorite. I don’t know if I will repurchase when I run out, may try something new.\n",
      "Line2589: Very hydrating and smells nice. I can’t really see any difference on the appearance of my under eyes, but my under eyes always feel moisturized!\n",
      "Line2590: Been using this eye bomb for a while now. The jar with last you a while since a little goes a long way! It’s a good value for how much product you get. I love the way it makes my under eyes feel and how it wears underneath makeup!\n",
      "Line2591: This is my first eye cream. I got a sample with a holiday pack of their moisturizer. I was not disappointed. You can feel it working right away. A little bit goes a long way. It’s a 5mL sample and I know I’ll get at least 3 weeks of use out of it. I’m using it night and day. I’ll def buy the full size when this finishes.\n",
      "Line2592: I was honestly hoping for more. Yes, it moisturizes, but like.... so do drugstore products. If I’m paying this much for a product, I expect it to make more of a difference. Also, I just purchased this in December  and don’t even use it every day but it’s almost gone. Not much product and not enough of an impact for me to repurchase.\n",
      "Line2593: I am trying to judge this the best I can because I don’t deal with severe undereye dryness or huge dark circles on a regular basis. However, I went through the entire trial size of this using it every morning and night and my undereyes were always moisturized. It has a gel texture and soaks in nicely. Does not leave a sticky residue. Recommend! I got this as a sample in my Sephora Play box!\n",
      "Line2594: Best eye cream ever. Totally worth the price and makes a huge difference in color, skin texture, and overall appearance of eyes!\n",
      "Line2595: Loved using this before putting on my makeup! It is so smooth and light. Doesn’t cake up at all!\n",
      "Line2596: i got a little version for free bc i had gotten another product but i dont believ this actually did anything? or at least i did not notice anything also i didnt use it for a couple days (i used it a couple times to see if there was a change) and i opened it and it was hard??? wouldnt really recommend but also i know people swear it helps them\n",
      "Line2597: This is my favorite eye cream that I’ve tried so far. It’s very moisturizing, and I have seen improvement in fine lines.\n",
      "Line2598: I use this product every day and it has kept my face refreshed and glowing for the day. I definitely will buy it agin!\n",
      "Line2599: Best hydrating eye cream for daily use. I apply this in the morning, it is gentle, non irritating and keeps my eye area smooth and plump. It exceeded my expectations.\n",
      "Line2600: This is amazing! Some eye creams give me milia but not this one. The area around my eye was so dry that it was flaking and this cleared it right up. This is the best winter eye cream\n",
      "Line2601: Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is an extremely refreshing gel type moisturizer. This gel texture leaves the delicate eye area well hydrated.\n",
      "Line2602: Love the hydration this product gives me! I have been receiving sample sizes of this product and even the sample sizes last me a while since a little goes a long way! I apply it before my facial moisturizer step in my skincare routine and I have found that it brings life back around my eyes. Would definitely recommend and I will be purchasing the full size once I am through my samples.\n",
      "Line2603: Este hidratante de ojos es realmente maravilloso, su textura es muy ligera, pero hidrata muchísimo, es uno de los contornos de ojos que más me ha gustado y clara que seguiré utilizando. Súper recomendado.\n",
      "Line2604: Love this eye cream! Not as thick as the firming one so great for more everyday use. Love the way it glides on so smoothly. This paired with the aqua bomb face moisturizer is amazing!\n",
      "Line2605: I love how hydrating the belif moisturizing eyebomb is however I’m not a fan of the gel like texture and consistency. When it drys if kinda balls up and flakes off and feels really strange on your face. Even if you put cream over it. Not my fav\n",
      "Line2606: Lightweight moisture that doesn’t ball up under concealer. Not sure it has any anti-aging effects, but I use other things for that — this is mainly my daytime eye cream.\n",
      "Line2607: The best moisturizing eye cream! It makes your under-eye area so smooth. Makeup sits so well on top of this product.\n",
      "Line2608: This eye cream is expensive but definitely worth the money. I love how it makes my under eyes feel. I use it before I apply makeup and I find that my concealer goes on flawlessly. It really is very hydrating.\n",

      "Line2610: I have extremely dry under eyes, and eczema prone skin. I had given up on eye creams until I tried a sample of this. A little goes a long way and definitely helps keep my under eye and eyelids hydrated all day. Definitely will be a repeat purchase for me!\n",
      "Line2611: I love this product. My eyes have dark circles but they have lightened a bit. I got a sample from Sephora so it is a great value. It is gentle and gets rid of some lines. i have sensitive skin and it doesn't burn. I like the color and the shape and that it looks like lip balm. I might buy the full size.\n",

      "Line2613: Favorite eye cream! It’s so moisturizing and makes my under eyes smooth. I use in my night routine. You get a good amount of product for the price. I would recommend giving this a try if you are looking for a new eye cream\n",

      "Line2615: This product retains moisture up to 26 hours is dermatologically tested and is a true herbal cosmetic brand.\n",
      "Line2616: Leaves my under-eye area plump and hydrated. Doesn’t feel greasy and it is lightly scented! Great stuff!\n",
      "Line2617: I love the feel and texture of this eye cream. I consider it to be affordable compared to other brands. It has a nice fresh clean scent and it absorbs nicely without feeling greasy. I would highly recommend it. It has a 12 month shelf life which is great!\n",
      "Line2618: This product does an amazing job moisturizing your under eyes and eye lid. This is a go to for me when my eyes feel dry and dehydrated.\n",
      "Line2619: I received this product free for testing purposes and fell on love. I recently ran out of my complimentary one and went out and purchased it on my own. It leaves my under eyes feeling smooth and soft and keeps them hydrated. I would recommend this product.\n",
      "Line2620: Bought this as part of a mini travel set Sephora was selling and I really love it. It helps to moisturize my under eyes and I'm starting to use it during the day to help with the dry winter.\n",
      "Line2621: I use this twice a day and it works to moisturize my undereyes. My husband uses this twice a day too and also loves the product! A little goes a long way and the product has a lot of good value for the price. I also love the packaging!\n",
      "Line2622: I received this in one of my beauty subscription boxes and I have been absolutely LOVING it!! It’s been lasting me quiet a while because a little of bit goes a long way! It keeps my undereyes so moisturized and hydrated! And the scent of this product is so refreshing ! Highly recommend !\n",
      "Line2623: I cannot rave enough about this ! I needed an eye cream and i got a sample at Sephora. Truly life changing. My concealer goes on so smoothly after using the eye cream. It’s so moisturizing especially in the winter and is just amazing!! Spend the money and get it!!!\n",
      "Line2624: It has a great texture and smells really good. It moisterizes really well I’m not sure if it helps with wrinkles or puffiness cause I don’t see a drastic change when I started using it since I’m still young\n",
      "Line2625: Holy grail of eye products. I use this every night and every morning! It is a beautiful and lightweight texture that is very gel like. I’m definitely going to buy it again when I run out, but so far it has lasted me over 4 months and I’m only half way through. So you definitely get a lot of product!\n",
      "Line2626: Love this stuff! Won’t break the bank and is super hydrating. 100% recommend, especially to those of you who have dry under eyes.\n",
      "Line2627: I have never been a skincare junky but this definitely kick started my skin care journey. I love how it feels. I usually put it on at night before bed. I wake up with super soft under eyes. (I’m prone to dry skin).\n",
      "Line2628: This stuff is the bomb. I noticed a difference in texture after the first use. My under eyes get quite dry and this moistened them right up.\n",
      "Line2629: LOVE LOVE LOVE this moisturizer. Extremely light on the skin and absorbs super fast. Love the light fresh scent as well. I can definitely feel the hydration the next morning when I apply it at night. I would've never tried this product if it wasn't for influenster. Now I am hooked and buying a full size!\n",
      "Line2630: I love this gentle soothing eye cream. I use it whenever my eyes get dry - particularly on those harsh cold days as winter approaches. I only need a little product and it goes a long way! Finally, my eyes are just as moisturized as my face!!\n",
      "Line2631: This eye bomb works well for me. It  didn't remove my dark circles but they were much less visible. I like the texture a lot\n",
      "Line2632: I love this eye cream. The results could be a bit better, but i love how it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.\n",
      "Line2633: This is probably one of the most hydrating eye creams I have ever used. The ingredients are great and it’s not overly scented. First time user and a lifelong one now.\n",
      "Line2634: This product is hydrating and light weight. I see a difference between using this daily and trying something new. I tend to always go back to the eye bomb.\n",
      "Line2635: This product isn’t awful, but it’s also not life-changing either. The packaging is nice, the scent is nice, & feels hydrating when you put it on; it feels hydrating when you first put it on, but my under eyes are still somewhat dry when I wake up in the morning. I’m just using this product up until I finish it...probably will not be repurchasing :(\n",
      "Line2636: Has a really nice feel on the skin. I didn’t notice any major change in bags or darkness but definitely was moisturizing to the skin and added softness\n",
      "Line2637: This is my holy grail eye cream. It feels SO extremely hydrating and refreshing under my eyes. I love putting this on morning AND night. I’ve seen such a difference in my eyes as well!\n",
      "Line2638: I got this as a sample size from Sephora and immediately became obsessed with it. It is so hydrating. I am not sure if it’s cooling or if it just feels cold to me because of where I store it, but it’s incredible. I use it at morning and at night. My concealer goes on so smoothly, and I don’t have to worry about cakes or dry/tired looking eyes anymore!\n",
      "Line2639: This is one of my favorite skin care products! Super light, non greasy, and absorbs quickly. It’s great to use before applying makeup, I’ve noticed when I used it as an eye primer it makes application much smoother and reduces makeup caking in fine lines\n",
      "Line2640: I really love this eye cream, perfect for priming under eyes for make up. I wouldn’t say it’s the best eye cream I’ve ever used but it is worth using\n",
      "Line2641: I love this stuff!! I haven't tried a belif product yet I did not like, and this one didn't disappoint!  Would purchase again.\n",
      "Line2642: This is currently my favorite eye cream. My main areas of concerns are my under eyes which tend to get super dry. This eye bomb works best to keep my eyes hydrated. I noticed improvement in my skin the first week I tried this eye cream. I highly recommend this.\n",
      "Line2643: Favorite eye cream. So smooth. Light. Sinks into skin. Doesn’t cause bumps under my eye. Doesn’t irritate my eyes either.\n",
      "Line2644: This is a very moisturizing cream. I love how it feels under my eyes. It doesn’t feel too heavy but not too light either. Really hydrates my under eyes. Sometimes, I put it all over my face and it feels great.\n",
      "Line2645: When using this as an overnight eye cream, I found that it just made my under eyes sticky and didn’t do much for hydration. It did not meet my expectations for such a pricey product\n",
      "Line2646: I got this in the sample size and I don’t think I’ll be repurchasing it but mostly due to the fact that I don’t want need more moisturized under-eyes. It did little to nothing to brighten my eyes and if you have a good moisturizer I don’t think this product is necessary\n",
      "Line2647: Nice eye cream, very moisturizing (lol I mean, it's in the name), but outside of being a decent moisturizer, it's nothing extraordinary. I like the texture and the way it absorbs, so if all you need is that, this would suit your needs fine. I'm getting to the point where I need something that would plump up fine lines around my eyes, and this doesn't really do the trick, so perhaps a good fit for someone in their early to mid twenties that wants a nice hydrating eye cream with a smooth, light texture.\n",
      "Line2648: This is a pretty good eye product. Very hydrating. I use it every other day because I use alot of face products. Good buy.\n",
      "Line2649: it really does moisturize for a long time! i dont have much experience with eye cream except for an eye cream i used years ago from wish (dont recommend buying skincare from wish, dont know what they put in there) this is very moisturizing and smells pretty good! i received a small sample in my sephora birthday gift. the cream smells fresh with a minty vibe\n",
      "Line2650: This whole line is my new favorite. I love this eye cream. It keeps you hydrated but not oily\n",
      "Line2651: I really, really like this product. It feels light on the skin and fairly moisturizing. I think I'm going to try one of their other eye products though, so I can find one that works better for anti aging and fine lines.\n",
      "Line2652: A great eye cream its moisturizes without clogging pores. I saw noticable different in my skin after using it\n",
      "Line2653: I am almost running out of my first pot of this product and need to get a replacement ASAP. It leaves my under eyes baby-soft, and helps my under eye concealer go on smoothly.\n",
      "Line2654: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is the bomb! I got this sample in my iPSYbag & love it. It is slightly greasy but is very moisturizing for my tired wrinkly eyes. It doesnt burn like many eye moisturizers & a little goes a long way. I definitely want to try more products from @belifcanada !\n",
      "Line2655: This is my most recent addition to my skincare routine line and pile of skincare products. I decided to splurge on this during the Sephora Holiday promotion sale. I've been thinking about purchasing an eye cream and started adding it to my skincare regimen. I'm in my twenties so at this age, I do not have any wrinkles yet. But I wanted to start working on prevention. I did a lot of research while deciding which eye cream brand to get. I've used this for a while now and while I like the product, I have to be honest and say the results aren't apparent. I mean, I don't have eye wrinkles so I guess the results won't be instant like some who say they saw differences in their wrinkles or dark circles. I do have dry skin in the winter, so this product is good at keeping my skin hydrated. While I don't think this product is giving me instant results, I do think this will help my skin in the long term and work on prevention of wrinkles. When I apply it after my moisturizer, I feel a cooling sensation. This might feel good for those with tired eyes. This product is definitely a splurge at $48 for a tiny bottle. This product does go a long way since it's only used in the eye area, which is a small area. A little product goes a long way!\n",
      "Line2656: My undereyes feel moisturised but didn’t do anything great for my dark circles. Didn’t irritate my eyes.\n",
      "Line2657: Muy ligera. Yo tengo muy seca el area de las ojeras y por eso no me gusto mucho. Creo que seguiré probando otras\n",
      "Line2658: Great for my eyes. I always wake up with little Crustees and dry around my eyes. This instantly gives me moisture\n",
      "Line2659: I received this eye bomb from Influenster a while back and have been using it every night ever since. It makes my eyes feel refreshed and I have noticed a slight reduction in my wrinkles. I plan to keep it as a part of my nightly routine.\n",
      "Line2660: This is very creamy and moisturizing. It feels good on my under eyes.. I can tell a big difference in my under eyes when I apply concealer. It applies nice and smooth. Wish it was a little cheaper, but it is nice.\n",
      "Line2661: Really enjoyed the intense moisture provided by this product! It kept my under eye area hydrated throughout the day and improved the appearance of fine lines. I felt like my concealer still slightly creased when layered on top though, and it didn’t do anything for the appearance of dark circles.\n",
      "Line2662: simple eye cream....but the simplicity feels like it makes this eye cream very effective! skin around eye area is moisturized and it's not too heavy where i would get milia\n",
      "Line2663: I tried this as a sample and a ton of product came in it! I use this everyday as an eye cream and usually eye creams will break me out but this one does not. My eyes are hydrated as the product claims to do.\n",
      "Line2664: very hydrating. i love this stuff. i have very dry, dark under eyes so i put this on before bed every night and it has definitely made my under eyes softer and more hydrated, would recommend to those with under eyes like mine.\n",
      "Line2665: This eye cream is thebomb.com. I love using it under my eyes to avoid any dry or flaky skin issues during the cold winter months. And there is a ton of product in this size!\n",
      "Line2666: This is a very refreshing product. I used it for a while but never really saw a difference. I am not disappointed because it felt good when I put it underneath my eyes at night. Which I could have seen results to give this a better review.\n",
      "Line2667: I find that if I don’t use this product, my under eye cakes. This could be because I’m dry throughout the winter. I make sure to add this around my nose as well as I tend to get cakey there as well\n",
      "Line2668: This product is great for when I want to brighten up my under eye area. This product is light and soaks in quickly so you don't need to worry about your makeup moving around on top of it if you apply in the morning! I would recommend this product to those who want a great hydrating eye cream.\n",
      "Line2669: I love how light this eye cream is. The consistency is closer to a gel. I can’t use rich eye creams as I get a lot of milia around my eyes.\n",
      "Line2670: Love this eye cream! I have super sensitive skin and over the winter my eczema tends to act up, so when I did start using this my skin got a little irritated around my eye. I let my husband use it instead and it made all the difference for his eye area! Super hydrated!!\n",
      "Line2671: Creamy and lovely - I wear it overnight, especially in the winter, to keep my eye area bright and refreshed.\n",
      "Line2672: Super moisturizing and i never have to worry about it clogging my pores. It's also very light weight and never feels heavy\n",
      "Line2673: I love how this actually soaks into my skin. It feels hydrating and lightweight. It also wears well under makeup. I’m not sure if it does what it advertises since I only had a sample size but I would purchase.\n",
      "Line2674: The texture this product has is so perfect. It feels amazing, refreshing, it absorbs right away, it leaves your skin feeling so moisturized, and makeup applies beautifully on top. Highly recommend it for anyone with dry skin under their eyes.\n",
      "Line2675: This is one of the most soothing and moisturizing eye creams I’ve used. I love belif’s products and this one is no exception. I’ve had the same tub for over a year. A little goes a long way. Definitely a repurchase when my skin needs hydration.\n",
      "Line2676: The best lightweight moisturizing eye cream! I recommend this to everyone. Affordable as well. Doesn’t leave the greasy feel\n",
      "Line2677: WOW. I've been looking for an under eye moisturizer that fights dryness, doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, and reduces the appearance of fine lines (I'm only 22, where did these even come from??). So far no luck - that is until I received this sample from Sephora. I used it at night 4 times so far and I really see a difference. The lines under my eyes aren't as noticeable and the color of my dark circles appears to be lighter. It's really made me feel better about my skin in only four uses. I wouldn't recommend using it under makeup even though it is light for two reasons. One, its still a moisturizer and doesn't dry/sink in very fast. This can clash with your concealer or foundation and look oily or streaky. Second, the first night I put it on I stayed up for little bit and noticed  that it got clumpy and looked like scales, by touching it it rolled off...pretty gross. However, when I put it on before bed I wake up bright eyed with smooth skin. Overall, the price point for the actual product is a real pain. If you can get it on sale I DEFINITELY recommend. if you don't mind dropping $50 on an eye cream it's worth it as well.\n",
      "Line2678: I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product. It was my first time using this brand and the price point is fair. Also my skin hydrated and glowing and the product stayed put. More than I can say for my higher dollar eye cream. This is my new fave.\n",
      "Line2679: It’s one of my everyday skin care products, it’s my first time using it and I really love this product, my eyes looks more hydrated. It’s a very effective product and i highly recommend this, I’ll buy it again\n",
      "Line2680: I love this product! Not only does it smell great but it is super hydrating. You only need a tiny bit and your eyes instantly feel moisturized and good to go! I apply it every night before bed and I definitely have noticed that the bags under my eyes are less noticeable in the mornings!\n",
      "Line2681: This product is awesome!! Super hydrating and really notice a difference in undereye circles.\n",
      "Line2682: This is a very moisturizing product , however I think it is too heavy for the under eye area. It can cause milia and heaviness under there instead of brightening . I like the moisture it brings although I wish it was lighter. However i just use this in the winter on my face instead !\n",
      "Line2683: I love this eye cream! It feels amazing on my eyes every night before I go to bed! It’s a great value with the size of the jar and the quality of belief products is always high!\n",
      "Line2684: This is hands down my favorite eye moisturizer! This product lasted so long as well! Kept my eyes moisturized all day, especially during the dry months here in the Midwest! I would recommend this product to anyone!\n",
      "Line2685: This eye cream is nice and hydrating but it didn’t blow me away. It would be good for someone who is just starting to use eye creams since it is pretty basic.\n",
      "Line2686: Got this in a kit and really enjoy the hydration it gives my eyes during the colder months. Moderately priced-honestly about the same as play\n",
      "Line2687: I use this on my under eyes everyday and it definitely helps with hydrating this delicate area. I definitely use it when I use a foundation and/or concealer that may dry out the skin in this area. It keeps my under eye area from looking creasy and dried out. I also love the way it feels when you first apply it, it has a cooling affect. Love using this product and will continue to buy it.\n",
      "Line2688: So moisturizing and not greasy at all. Leaves my eyes feeling awake and refreshed. Frangrence is subtle\n",
      "Line2689: This is a nice eye cream for dry skin and tired looking eyes. My skin can get a little oily, so I prefer to use this at night. It’s got an incredible moisturizing gel-like texture. Goes on smooth, easy to apply, and you really feel your skin soaking up the moisture after use.\n",
      "Line2690: I don’t know how much I got my sample from the makeup even and I love the feel of this cream leaves my eye refresh after washing off all the make up.\n",
      "Line2691: I took 1 star off simply for the price. This stuff is amazing. I’m prone to extremely dry skin under my eyes (and hand area) and this stuff is awesome. My under eye area was plump and extremely hydrated the next morning.  I had received this in my Sephora Play! Box and wish the price wasn’t so steep to purchase the full sized version.\n",
      "Line2692: This is nice and light weight. Hydrated and doesn’t break me out. Can’t beat the price!\n",
      "Line2693: Very nice moisturizing cream for the eye area. Lightweight yet effective. My eyes get very dry during fall/winter season so this product helps to replenish the moisture. I would recommend this product.\n",
      "Line2694: I’m in love with this eye bomb. It works wonders.   My under eyes look so much better every single time I use it. I love the packaging is super gentle on my eyes it doesn’t burn or anything like that.\n",
      "Line2695: Love this product!! I used it at night all over my face and woke up to glowing plump skin\n",
      "Line2696: Really good! I bought mine a few months ago in a trip to Boston and I haven’t stopped using ever since. Light weight, my under eye skin feels smooth and I’ve started to notice that my eye bags are improving. Love it!\n",
      "Line2697: The most moisturizing eye cream I've ever used! And it says so well under makeup. I have definitely repurchased multiple times.\n",
      "Line2698: Freaking obsessed with this eye cream! First time I tried it I wasn't into it because I thought it caused milia but after trying it again months later, no milia! Must have been caused by something else. This eye cream is super moisturizing and helps with fine lines that I get due to dehydration around my eyes.\n",
      "Line2699: I generally don't use eye creams but received this in a subscription box and now I am hooked. My undereyes are less dark and less puffy in the mornings.\n",
      "Line2700: I'm not super into eye creams; I'd rather use a great face moisturizer and serum. But then I tried belif's moisturizing eye bomb and I'm obsessed! The texture and smell are divine, and it seems to have real staying power overnight compared to other eye creams I've used. I wouldn't normally spend that much money on an eye product, but I'm considering splurging on this again soon.\n",
      "Line2701: i love this eye bomb. not exactly sure if it removes the appearance of under eyes, but definitely makes my under eyes moisturized which is what the products main purpose serves.\n",
      "Line2702: Great smell, and liked the texture however it left my undereyes dry. I was disappointed, as this product was harsh. Leaves a flakey texture on my face. I think the price point is good. But there is room for improvement!\n",
      "Line2703: Very creamy and light. Putting it on your face is cool and feels refreshing; in the morning especially it helps to wake me up a bit, and reduces any puffiness in my eyes from very obvious to not noticeable.  It lasts a long time as well - it spreads easily so you don't need to apply a lot to cover both eyes. Using makeup on top of it hasn't been an issue. I use it in the AM and sometimes PM, but that may be unnecessary considering how elastic and smooth my eyes feel up to a day or so after applying it.\n",
      "Line2704: I love this eye cream! I use everyday because it’s not too greasy. It sinks in really well and restore moisture to the skin around your eyes. It doesn’t have a harsh fragrance so it doesn’t sting my eyes. I would definitely purchase this again! Well worth cost!!!\n",
      "Line2705: This is your very basic eye cream. It’s nothing out of this world but gets the job done. It did seem to decrease puffiness but not drastically. The packaging is very simple and I love it! Perhaps if it were more moisturizing with antiwrinkle properties this would be better.\n",
      "Line2706: I really like this eye cream super hydrating and lightweight goes well under my make up will repurchase this product\n",
      "Line2707: One of my favorite skincare brands. I love the products because it does what it claims. Hydrating and moisturizing. Their products are worth every cent.\n",
      "Line2708: THE BEST EYE CREAM!!! I love how moisturizing this is under the eyes. You only need a small amount of product so it lasts for months! I always had dry under eyes but this product has eliminated it! Don't let the higher price point detur you! Its the best!\n",
      "Line2709: Love this product and have repurchased multiple times now. Its moisturizing without being too heavy so I can wear makeup over top. Doesn’t irritate my eyes at all. Some other eye products can cause a burning sensation.\n",
      "Line2710: I loved the Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. The product smelled great and the packaging was nice. I would definitely use it again. Since I received a sample I would love to see the size of the product sold in stores. It went on smooth and left my skin feeling refreshed.\n",
      "Line2711: This product is great. I received it complimentary for testing purposes and really enjoyed using it. It's super smooth and gel-like and really imparts long lasting moisture. Plus it has a really nice, subtle, spa-like scent. Only con is it's a little pricey for a pretty basic moisturizer.\n",
      "Line2712: This product works great! It offers lots of hydration to my under eyes. A little goes a long way, so I don’t feel like I’m using all my product every time I use a little. The smell is great as well. Well worth the purchase.\n",
      "Line2713: This product is very good and I use everyday at night. It did meet my expectations and I’m very excited about it\n",
      "Line2714: I got a sample of this. The product is a gel like texture. It soaks I’m pretty well and feels moisturizing. I wish it didn’t come in a jar packaging. Too early to see results.\n",
      "Line2715: Creamy, thick, and goes a long way. Has no scent so it isn’t overwhelming. A little greasy. Very moisturizing.\n",
      "Line2716: I spent way too much time in the pool and sun this past summer, which made the skin around my eyes dry and tender. I first received this as a sample from Sephora and immediately fell in love after my first use. This eye bomb does everything it says. My sensitive skin felt improvement after just 2 uses. I was hooked and bought the full size. One of the best moisturizing eye creams I've ever used.\n",
      "Line2717: I really love how moisturizing this eye cream, however that is ALL that it does - which is fine for some but I'm looking for an eye cream to moisturize AND reduce fine lines, etc. Also, the price is a little steep in my opinion for an eye cream that is only a moisturizer BUT if money were no object for me, I'd buy this regularly to use on top of my regular multi-tasking eye cream.  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line2718: This stuff works wonders. I have tryed so many other products and nothing seems to hydrate as much as this guy does. It is a bit pricy but you get a ton of product which last a very great while. You only need a bit and your good to go\n",
      "Line2719: This is absolutely one of my favorite eye creams of all time. First of all, belif is one of my holy grail brands because they have incredibly moisturizing products that really quench the skin. The skin around my eyes is quite dry and this eye cream moisturizes the area so thoroughly. The product is gel-like instead of too creamy, which is perfect for me as creaminess in eye products tend to break me out. It smells incredible and it really seeps into the skin. I wake up with hydrated eyes. It also kind of feels refreshing to apply. I love the packaging and I don't think I'll buy another eye cream for a while!\n",
      "Line2720: Great texture, highly moisturising eye cream. I apply this often to the eye area during the Fall and Winter. The entire line of hydrating products at Belif are fantastic! Gentle on skin and does a great job. I would purchase again.\n",
      "Line2721: I love the smell of this! But it’s wayyyy to thick to be a successful eye cream. I like it a lot for eczema/sebderm break outs. It’s definitely better for night use. It’s really rich, but sinks in quickly.\n",
      "Line2722: Wow. This is hands down the best eye cream I have ever used. It is super moisturizing and always succeeds in making my eyes look brighter. Way exceeded my expectations!t\n",
      "Line2723: I love this eye cream. I wasn’t an eye cream person before receiving a sample of this, but I quickly became hooked and now I’m halfway through my first jar.  This has similar qualities to other belif products that I love: it’s silky and gel-like upon application and it has a plumping and deeply moisturizing effect on the skin that lasts.   This makes me feel fresh and awake after I apply it. My makeup goes on much smoother after I use it!   This is also a great value; I’m halfway through this jar and I’ve been using it daily for about six months!\n",
      "Line2724: This definitely lives up to its expectations when it comes to moisturizing your under-eyes! However can’t say that it does much in way of helping elasticity. Consistency is like that of a water-gel, and feels very cooling on the under-eyes. A great option if you’re only looking for moisture!\n",
      "Line2725: This is a great light weight eye creme. It almost has a gel like texture and absorbs very well. It has the classic belif scent. It's great for use in the morning or at night and can be used under makeup. It provides a great moisturized feeling on the eye area.\n",
      "Line2726: Me  encantó este producto para mis ojos..me humectada mucho el área de los ojos y se siente super fresco..😀\n",
      "Line2727: Love this eye cream. It’s super hydrating and absorbs nicely into the skin. Makeup sits on top nicely. Took a star off because I feel like for the price there are other options out there that are just as good.\n",

      "Line2730: I have very tired, dry, dull, and dark under eyes. Needless to say I have tried a lot of under eye creams. And I have found the one. No eye cream has ever moisturized my under eye and eye lid. I honestly feel like my eyes looked brighter and fuller.   It has a gel like consistency. I tend to prefer products that feel “cold” when applied to the eye. The cooling effect helps depuff. I think the gel is particularly beneficial to the eye area because it’s hydrating without feeling too heavy.   Have and will continue to repurchase. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line2731: Such a great Formula for day time. Use this every morning before I do my makeup and it is just the perfect base for my concealer. It is just hydrating enough but not heavy when you concealer just slips and slides like if I use a heavier eye cream such as the shiseido benefiance one\n",
      "Line2732: I got this as a sample in my play by Sephora box. I finally started using it and I wish I had sooner! It is so hydrating. I don’t necessarily need the extra moisture, but it definitely makes around my eyes smooth and less wrinkly/ puffy.\n",
      "Line2733: very very good undereye moisturizer.. i wouldn't say it does a great job at covering or lessening the appearance of bags but really does moisturize under the eye SO well.. i love the watery like consistency and think this product is so hydrating\n",

It also gave me milia (those tiny white bumps under the eyes), to be fair I have very sensitive under eyes and this happens to me fairly often with eye creams, but for anyone with similar skin, I would stay away from this product ! :(\n",
      "Line2736: I received this in my Ipsy bag and had a horrendous reaction. Small bumps like hives formed all around my orbital bone and they HURT. It took 3-5 days for them to go away, I couldn’t wear any make up or they would be further irritated. I used Tarte Eye Cream before and never had a reaction like this. I would not recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.\n",

      "Line2741: This stuff is heaven for the under-eye area. I have dark circles and under-eyes that tend towards being dry (especially after all the concealer it takes to cover dark circles). This cream will instantly get rid of puffiness and feels cool and deeply hydrating upon application. You know you’re doing the delicate skin there good with some aqua bomb love and it can revive the most tired, crepey looking under eye.\n",
      "Line2742: Got this as a sample from Sephora and it lasted me so long! Excited to buy the full size since the sample lasted forever. Loved the formula and the way it felt on my skin. Honestly did not notice any changes in my dark circles but I guess not sleeping will do that to ya!\n",

Alcohol is actually listed in the ingredients.

      "Line2783: I love this stuff. I’m one of those people that never really sees a difference from eye creams, but this one is great. It’s more like a gel, and what I like most about it is that it doesn’t travel into your eyes like I find most eye creams do. It absorbs quickly, moisturizes well, and looks great under makeup.\n",
      "Line2784: I've been using this twice a day for about 3 weeks or so and I've definitely notice that the little fine lines next to my eyes are diminished. I think the biggest factor in that is that the Moisturizing eye bomb is the perfect combination of moisturizing (of course) with a nice texture and enough substance to stick around all day or night. I love the packaging and the size is very generous. I'm used to eye creams in little jars, but this one is a much more generous size and I've barely made a dent in it. It is a gel cream texture, not oily, and it absorbs well, but also protects the eye area so your skin doesn't just suck it up and leave the area dry again. It really does last for at least 10 hours or so I'd say, probably lo\n",

      "Line2789: I first got this in one of my beauty subscription boxes and after trying it out, its now part of my nightly skin care regimen!! Just a tiny bit of this tapped under my eyes is all it takes for hydrated & smooth looking skin! This makes my foundation and concealor easily glide on, without looking dry, patchy or cakey!! I really notice the difference this eye cream makes to my under eyes, Im really loving it!!\n",
      "Line2790: Very moisturizing but not too thick. It’s definitely worth the money too!! I’ve used Este Lauder eye creams and they just don’t do the same as this! And they are almost twice as expensive.\n",

      "Line2793: Such an amazing eye cream.  Super super super hydrating - good for young ppl who need an affordable and effective eye cream and also good for older ppl worried about wrinkles and fine lines since it's so hydrating!  Smells amazing and feels so good when applied.  I've been using mine since January (9 months) twice a day and there's still soo much product left! You barely need any!\n",
      "Line2794: I love belif products, and this one is no different. It met ever expectation i had for it and the brand, it moisturized my dry under eyes helped give them some supleness so less tiny lines. I like to put mine in the fridge because it helps depuff my eyes in the morning before i do my makeup. It absorbs well, no tackiness or greasy feeling felt behind. I just wish the jars on belif products weren't deceiving lol i know it goes by oz but it still a let down onky the middle on the container is filled.\n",
      "Line2795: I love this eye-cream it really does moisturize your eye. I think it does not get rid of my puffy eyes and this product is over priced as I’ve tried other eye creams that feel much more refreshed for a cheaper price.\n",
      "Line2796: This stuff is the real deal. It esp saved me in the winter time because i have very dry skin under my eyes when the weather is cold. Very soothing and gentle. Give this a try it works\n",

Product applies easily and isn’t too greasy - I typically applied at night and slept with it on. Did provide great moisture through the whole day and seemed to give some lift to the skin. Smells good but not overwhelmingly so. Would definitely buy again.\n",

      "Line2800: This is a great eye moisturizer. It is gel like and cooling. My eyes feel moisturized immediately after applying, but continue to feel hydrated. Appears to be more plump in he under-eye area. Not greasy or heavy. My eyes are sensitive and this doesn’t cause irritation. No harsh smells.\n",

      "Line2808: The eye bomb does exactly what it promises! It's highly moisturizing. If you are only looking for a moisturizing eye cream, this is for you. It's the only eye cream that I have right now. If you're looking for dark circle and puffiness relief, this is not for you but Belif doesn't make those promises. I put this on last before I do my makeup and it goes on well over it. Soaks in nicely and hours later, is still hydrated. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Line2809: Feels good going on but I haven’t really seen that it makes a big difference in the under eye area.   It adds moisture but that’s about it.  Little expensive but it has lasted me quite some time since you don’t need much.\n",
      "Line2810: The Eye Bomb is a little creamier and can definitely also be used by people with dry skin b/c of its thicker consistency. It is pricey but a little bit of this product goes a long way. I highly recommend this eye cream. It is truly a really good quality product.\n",
      "Line2811: Hands down my all time favorite under eye moisturizer I use this every single day morning and night I recommend every one to get this product I love it\n",

      "Line2813: I absolutely love this eye cream. Is does a great job at keeping your under eye moisturized. It is a great nighttime cream because it is a little think. The price is very reasonable. I would definitely use again!\n",
      "Line2814: All I have to say is WOAH! I used a few products on my face and ended up with a dry patch! This dry patch was so visible and patchy I thought it would take forever to go away. On the second day I went into Sephora in the morning to put some of this eye cream on around my eyes and on my dry patch ( the dry patch was close to my eye) and when I tell you by the end of the day it was already half way healed! When I got home, I did my facial routine with more of the eye cream and the BELIF Aqua Bomb Sleeping Mask 2.53 fl oz (Jelly pudding sleeping mask) and the results were insane. My dry patch literally healed overnight! Idk what insane unicorn ingredients they have in this but this eye bomb is no joke! It’s the best eye cream I’ve tried in my life! It makes the others look mediocre! The consistency is also thin and absorbs nicely so it’s perfection day and night! This eye cream is a dream!\n",
      "Line2815: I got a deluxe sample of this in my order a few months ago. I’ve been using this every night and it really does what it claims. You only need a tiny bit under both eyes and it keeps the under eye area so hydrated!! Highly recommend!\n",

      "Line2817: I love all of the belif products that I have tried. They all tend to be lightweight but also extremely moisturizing. They are perfect for me because I have very oily skin. A little goes a long away also which is good for the wallet.\n",
      "Line2818: It’s just like the belif aqua bomb but better! I received a mini size in the Aqua Playland Set at Sephora. If you’re looking into getting this, try the set at the Sephora. You get the full size aqua bomb, and minis of the eye bomb and Hungarian water essence — for the same price as the aqua bomb! Such a good deal. The product itself is great. The best moisturizer for under eye. I’ve only used it at night before bed. 10/10 recommend!\n",

I feel like my eyes are refreshed! I feel like they’re less draggy! And my eye lids hold my make up so much longer! I totally love belif and EVERYTGING THEY STAND FOR!\n",
      "Line2821: I recently received this item in a subscription service and was absolutely delighted to find this product sink into the skin and quickly do its job. I find that it is so moisturizing and helps to eliminate any dryness that irritates me.\n",
      "Line2822: Decent price for the amount of product you get, and it does a good job of hydrating the under eye area, but that’s about it.\n",

      "Line2825: This is an amazing eye cream. It hydrates my under eyes and brightens and minimizes the appearance of dark circles. It is a nice gel-like consistency and doesn't cause my concealer to crease like some other eye creams. I would totally buy this again and again.\n",
      "Line2826: By far my favorite eye bomb at this moment.  I wear it every night.  It is so light weight, a little goes a long way.  I have oily and dry skin (combination skin) and it works perfectly.  The bomb has more of a gel consistency which is nice for oily and combination skin gals and guys. I works bomb under the eye (get it bomb). It leaves your under eye feeling soft, refreshing and clean and it also has help how my make up looks under my eye  much much better.  The packaging is basic but effective.  The price is a little to much for my personal liking but considering how a little goes a long way and the results you get it totally think it is worth it.  I will last you a long time.  A must try my oily and combination people.\n",
      "Line2827: I bought this eye cream because it had great reviews everywhere. It is a very moisturizing eye cream I found that that’s all it did for me. It didn’t help with my fine lines or darkness. I wouldn’t repurchase.\n",

      "Line2829: I absolutely love this brand. This eye cream felt so refreshing and cooling under my eyes. I also like the moisturizer from this brand and I feel they work very well together. Like most skin care is, this brand is high end but it works very well although it’s on the pricier side.\n",
      "Line2830: My eyelids and undereye get dry and flaky during the winter months and this was excellent to combat that dryness! It is very moisturizing without being heavy or overly oily. I really enjoyed using this and would repurchase this upcoming winter!\n",
      "Line2831: As far as eye creams go - it doesn’t get a lot better. Especially for this price point. I did notice that it has a tendency to get a little oily, so maybe not the best for someone who already had oily skin.\n",
      "Line2832: This eye cream is so moisturizing even on my dry under eye area. It’s great for sensitive skin and it doesn’t irritate my eye area at all. My makeup goes on flawlessly over top of it. I would definitely recommend giving this a try!\n",
      "Line2833: This eye cream is amazing. It really moisturizes the eye area without leaving it feeling greasy. It absorbs into the skin but doesn’t make the area feel tight or dry again in a few hours. Makeup applies beautifully overtop.\n",
      "Line2834: I tried this but I can't give a full review on the product coz I am only using it for less than month and I can't still see changes\n",
      "Line2835: I love this brand! I have used other products by belief in the past and I love them! They’re quite expensive but 100% worth it. It was my first time with this and I would definitely buy it again for what its worth I love it\n",

Easy to use..the packaging is cute and minimalistic, which I love. I would've given 5 stars, but it's a little out of the price range I like to spend on moisturizers.\n",

      "Line2840: Got a sample of this and it is easily the best hydrating eye cream I’ve ever tried. A little goes a long way too. I personally prefer eye products with anti-aging benefits but if I had really dry undereyes I would definitely use this.\n",

When I wake up the next morning my concealer applies like a breeze and doesn’t cling to any dry parts. Some people have found this eye dream to be TOO hydrating and lead to milia, but that hasn’t been the case for me! If you have dry under eyes you NEED to try this, it’s a lifesaver!\n",

      "Line2845: I purchase this in a kit first and I loved it. It is very moisturizing and it is very gentle around the eyes.\n",
      "Line2846: I've only used this a few times but it does do a good job of moisturizing. I love the moisturizing bomb so I thought this might pair well with it. I don't really have an evidence that it works on dark circles and that is one of my primary concerns so I probably won't repurchase.\n",
      "Line2847: The only eye cream I’ve ever used that made visible difference. Noticeable improvement in dark under eye circles, fine lines, and puffiness, all day! Completely worth 50 bucks for 3/4 of an ounce.\n",
      "Line2848: I have dry under eyes and this really moisturizer my skin. Plus, a little goes a long way. It’s moisturizing without being greasy and there is no scent. I bought this in a mini travel set which I would highly recommend.\n",
      "Line2849: How surprised I was by this product...  my undereye area is so dry, and I squint a lot during the day since I sit Infront of multiple screens all day, so I need some heavy duty hydration. And boy did this cream deliver! I apply in the morning, and am good all the way till the evening... no discomfort in my undereye area and no sign of dryness. I got this in a voxbox and immediately went and bought another. Just live this product , definitely one of the best eye hydration.\n",
      "Line2850: Not the best eye cream for helping diminish fine lines but super moisturizing. It feels somewhat like a gel cream so applying it feels cooling and soothing to the undereyes. I dont know if I would buy it again considering the price tag though. Maybe during a sale\n",

      "Line2872: Bomb.com! This eye product is a defiantly the best moisturizing product for eyes ! I’ve used it the first time and Completly fell in love ! For the price I think it’s worth it because you only need less then a dime size! It lasts me forever ! I would get it again!\n",
      "Line2873: Awesome product very moisturizing. Dried awesome and did not leave you oily. Definitely would recommend\n",
      "Line2874: I found this to be one of the most hydrating eye creams I've ever used. Most of my fine lines are due to dehydration, and this definitely helped with that! Negative: the packaging isn't my favorite (bulkier than it needs to be).\n",
      "Line2875: Absolute love ! Great eye cream for my sensitive skin. It absorbs quickly, moisturizes well, and has no residue. I hate eye creams that I can “roll”. This is definitely not one of them ! Also, you need a tiny amount, so it will last you for a while.\n",
      "Line2876: Let me start by saying I LOVE gel eye moisturizers! Since i have oily skin, I have found that these work best for me and dont add \"extra\" oil to my face. This eye gel felt cool on my skin and melted right in. I make sure I always apply this before bed and again in the morning and I have seen my under eyes look more plump (in a good way) and moisturized. Absolutley will continue to purchase this time and time again.\n",

      "Line2879: Such a great lightweight eye cream! I usually wear this one during the day because it lays so well underneath my makeup. It hydrates and soothes throughout the day without melting off like heavier eye creams. Definitely recommend!\n",
      "Line2880: I was never into using eye creams. I have used a few before and could not tell much of a difference so I just used normal moisturizer until I came across this. I originally bought it to use at night but I enjoy it so much I use it night and day. It makes my concealer go on so much smoother and has helped so much with my under eyes all together. Great product!\n",
      "Line2881: I really love this stuff wish 9 could afford some more!! It has really help with my puffy eyes..It works amazingly!  I have been having hearing and eye issuess.\n",
      "Line2882: I got a sample of Belif eye cream in a sephora order.  I know it's an eye cream,  but I used it on my full face and easily got 3 applications out of the sample pack,  so a little goes a long way.  It had a slight citrus-y scent but it's not overpowering.  It leaves my face feeling soft and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.  It's on par with my go-to moisturizer except that I prefer something with sun protection.\n",

      "Line2886: This is a solid eye cream, not the best I've used but its great to have around and the design of the bottle itself is very nice. I prefer to use this during the summer/humid temperatures it doesn't become runny like other under eye products so thats a definite plus.\n",
      "Line2887: I’ve only tried a trial size of this item but I LOVE it. My under eyes feel so refreshed and hydrated with this product. Will definitely be purchasing the full size.\n",

I’m only twenty but i figures it’s never to early to start taking care of your skin, so i use this every single night right after i finish taking my makeup and cleansing my skin and this stuff is amazing! I noticed right away the difference in my under eye area after 1 use\n",
      "Line2889: It is amazing!!!! Very moisturizing it leaves the under-eye smooth and brilliant, would recommend to anyone looking for a new rue cream\n",
      "Line2890: I love belif products. This eye cream felt nice on the skin, but I don’t feel like it did anything.\n",
      "Line2891: If you have dry under eyes this is perfect for you. This really adds a lot of moisture\n",
      "Line2892: I enjoy using the eye bomb, I wish that it soaked into the skin a little more, it feels as if it sits on top for a while. But it’s very gentle and great for sensitive skin.\n",
      "Line2893: This eye bomb is amazing. It’s hydrating it is more of a gel like consistency and it’s light weight not heavy underneath. I like the smell it’s soothing to me personally. And idk if anyone ever experience it but it does have a cooling feel too\n",
      "Line2894: I use this more as an under eye mask. When I put on my night sleeping mask (usually Water Sleeping Mask) I pu on a little extra of this. I don’t feel that it helps my under eyes look better, but it feels so hydrating and refreshing which feels amazing after having concealer on all day.\n",
      "Line2895: Made my eyes look more awake! I use this every morning as part of my morning routine.\n",
      "Line2896: Very light and not too thick on the skin. I love using it at night to cool and calm the eye area.\n",
      "Line2897: I got this as a sample and was super excited about it because I love this brand, I regularly use their moisturizing bomb and it's a hol\n",
      "Line2898: This is the best eye cream. It is super moisturizing without being heavy. The package is great as well. I have now bought this several times and I will keep buying it. I would highly recommend this product!!!\n",
      "Line2899: I received the belief moisturizing eye bomb in an Ipsy bag last year and I have been hooked ever since.  It has a lightweight, gel-cream consistency that is not greasy or heavy under the eye. It does not irritate or cause my eyes to water like a lot of others I've tried. Using this daily has improved the hydration of my skin.\n",
      "Line2900: This is my current eye cream. I haven’t finished the jar. I think it’s effective. Moisturizing without being overly so (and disruptive to my makeup). It’s good.\n",
      "Line2901: Nothing special, soaks into the skin pretty quick since it is a gel but would not be good if your undereyes are really dry.. i have norman skin so this is just a precaution under makeup.  A little pricey for what it is but a little goes a long way.\n",
      "Line2902: I love This stuff! It really hydrated my under eye area, I even sampled their regular moisturizer and it was life changing!\n",
      "Line2903: This is a good eye cream for basic moisturization of the under eye area. It doesn't provide much more than that. But that is really all I was looking for. Eye cream is one of those things that I am always looking for something better.\n",
      "Line2904: The most perfect moisturizing eye bomb! I use it most nights (that I don’t forget), and on days I feel that my under eyes or lids are feeling dry, I apply this before my makeup and it helps immediately!\n",
      "Line2905: This product is very hydrating and light. It does not leave your skin feeling greasy, and it brightens your complexion.\n",
      "Line2906: I absolutely love how hydrating this cream is and how nice it smells. I always hated creams that feel dry under my eyes but this one is perfect!\n",
      "Line2907: I use this underneath makeup as a 360 eye cream. I use a small pea-sized amount and dab it on my under eyes up to my brow bone and onto my eyelids. It wakes me up in the morning and where is beautiful you under my makeup all day without creasing and caking or cracking.\n",
      "Line2908: My favorite eye cream as of date. It provides instant moisture, helps combat dark circles and brightens. 5/5.\n",
      "Line2909: Keeps my eyes really moisturized :) my sister likes it too and she stole it from me haha but will be buying again!\n",
      "Line2910: Great for dry skin and for getting rid of pesky under eye bags. I have used this for about a week now and I have already noticed a difference in the smoothness around my eyes when I wake up, rather than puffy bags from sleeping. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to invest in a mildly priced eye cream. This is an essential part of any skin care routine.\n",
      "Line2911: My go-to, everyday eye cream. It leaves your eye contour soft and smooth, but never greasy. I’ve tried others but always come back to this. I’ve never had issue with makeup pilling over this like I’ve had with some others either. You can find deluxe samples of it in the summer and winter play land kits from Sephora. They will be packaged with either the Aqua bomb or moisturizing Bomb depending on the season, along with a Hungarian Water essence (all for the price of the moisturizer!)\n",
      "Line2912: Best eye cream I have ever used, I put in on my dry spots all over my face and it’s so moisturizing\n",
      "Line2913: I love this moisturizing eye cream  This cream provide up to 26 hours moisture and improve elasticity\n",
      "Line2914: I got this initially as a sample in a subscription box and have fallen in LOVE! It is pretty expensive but you only need a small amount so it lasts a very long time. I had my sample (pretty small jar) for probably 2 months 1-2x/day, every day. LOVE!\n",
      "Line2915: I’ve used this months with no change in dark circles, puffiness or wrinkles not sure if it even made to do that but I need a eye cream that does so this doesn’t do much for me except provide moisture under eye..use this under my retinol eye cream and love that my eyes stay hydrated also good under makeup for dry eye folks\n",
      "Line2916: I love Belif, but I don’t see the benefit of using this over the regular moisturizer under the eye. It’s pretty much the same product, just a more expensive. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line2917: This is a decent eye cream. I don’t know if I would buy it again though because I didn’t notice any improvement and it feels like vasaline on my face. Good ingredients though which is important to me.\n",
      "Line2918: I love love love this! I have used belif moisturizers for a few years and I am obsessed with all of them! I actually got this one from Influenster VoxBox & fell in love! It is expensive, but a little goes a long ways so it will last a long time! Lightweight, non-greasy & keeps delicate under eye skin feeling soft and supple!\n",
      "Line2919: I was never a fan of eye creams until I was recommended this eye cream at Sephora. I skipped eye cream because I didn't see the benefits, and all eye creams I tried gave me little bumps under my eyes this eye cream is different because it's not a cream. It's a gel like consistency that feels a lot lighter than other eye creams and is easily absorbed. It has helps moisturize my under eye dry patches without it every clogging pores or giving me bumps.\n",
      "Line2920: I didn’t have wrinkles to correct BUT I definitely was seeing a decrease in moisture in the skin around my eyes. This is ultra hydrating, not too heavy and perfect for sensitive skin that can be easily aggitated. Loving this at night— but possibly a little too thick for daily use under makeup\n",
      "Line2921: This eye cream is THE BOMB. Literally. Hands down my favorite. Its lightweight but it helps with circles, puffiness, and helps to blur those pesky fine lines under the eye. Its the perfect base for your concealer as well!! 5 stars ✨\n",
      "Line2922: AMAZING!! Your eyes feel so hydrated after applying this product. I use this morning and night and don’t want to use anything else for the time being. I have problems with dryness under the eye which makes my makeup apply funny and this solves the problem! In love with this products and my eyes are too!\n",
      "Line2923: I received a sample jar of this from a friend who did not want this. I’ve been using it daily for about 2 weeks. I’ve not noticed any changes around and under my eyes yet but hopeful. I feel like the cream is not oily and does not leave any residue. I feel like a little goes a long way. I like using it and will probably start purchasing this eye cream.\n",
      "Line2924: Wasn’t sure if eye creams were truly worth it until I used this one! It truly hydrates and makes the skin around my eyes feel and look so healthy. Love this and it has become a staple in my routine\n",
      "Line2925: Really awesome eye cream. Smells expensive and I love it. Does a great job hydrating my under eyes.\n",
      "Line2926: I like this, but can’t say I would pay $50 for it. I’ve enjoyed my complimentary product, but can’t say this leaves “24 hours moisturized”. Can’t tell a difference. But I do like the smell, consistency, and packaging.\n",
      "Line2927: This is a great moisturizing eye cream! It always leaves my under eyes perfectly hydrated and sits well under makeup. You also get a ton of product for the price. I’ve been using since January and still have over half left!\n",
      "Line2928: I love how this stuff feels on my eyes. It decreased puffiness and has a cooling effect on the eyes. A little but goes a long way\n",
      "Line2929: I apply this everyday before doing my makeup and it works wonders!!! This has become an everyday product for my routine!!\n",
      "Line2930: Belief Moisturizing Eye Bomb is the bomb!  I just ordered my second jar in 3 months.  I use it morning and night and have noticed dramatic results.  My lines are much less noticeable.  It acts as a great base in the morning to prevent creasing in my make-up.\n",
      "Line2931: This product went beyond my expectations. The formula is so lightweight. It deeply hydrates my undereyes.\n",
      "Line2932: wow ! this ia amazingly waw i love the reasults the smell and all about it  i am uaing this product really it moatiruzes my eye amd vive it a perfecrt glowwwwwww i have a dry unnder eyes area reallt it works amazing wz me\n",
      "Line2933: nothing is more moisturizing than belief water bomb creams. This one is super hydrating for the eye area and smells nice too!\n",
      "Line2934: I absolutely love this stuff! This jar will last forever because you only need a little bit. It’s very moisturizing without being greasy.\n",
      "Line2935: This stuff is great. Smells like candy, like all of their products, is gentle, and does a great job plumping my under eye. It’s a pricier product, but it’s one of the best eye creams I’ve tried, so I think it’s worth it.\n",
      "Line2936: This is by far my favorite eye cream! I hate using most moisturizers on my face but this beats every other one I’ve tried! So effective!\n",
      "Line2937: This is the only eye moisturizer that doesn’t irritate my eyes AND sufficiently moisturizes them at the same time. Most eye creams make my eyes burn and water but this one doesn’t. It could be a little bit more moisturizing but overall I love it. I apply it on my entire eye area—on the undereye area and also my eyelids and have no problems. I’ve even gotten it IN my eye and had no discomfort or irritation from that. I mix it with a mushroom serum sometimes for added moisture. I think it helps keep away the finelines and wrinkles, I haven’t seen any new ones since I began using it. It also has a calming, natural smell (like verbena maybe) that dissipates quickly.\n",
      "Line2938: This is a lightweight gel that plumps up the undereye area. It sinks in quickly and feels cooling. It isn't anything special, though. I didn't see any significant change compared to the cream I used before this one.\n",
      "Line2939: Best eye cream ever hands down. Noticable difference in fine lines. Does not make makeup slip or crease at all. 100% recommend.\n",
      "Line2940: I usually apply this before I do my makeup and before bed. It does the perfect job of moisturizing my under eye. I also apply it to any dry spots I have on any part of my face and I’ve noticed them disappearing. I would most definitely recommend\n",
      "Line2941: Moisturizing and not super greasy but I am not super wowed by it. I will probably try another eye cream once I run out of this.\n",
      "Line2942: I LOVE THIS. I honestly think this might be one of the most hydrating products I’ve ever found for undereyes. I genuinely have trouble with dryness under eyes and this has honestly really helped. I’ve tried to find something wrong with it but honestly haven’t been able to. I lost my first jar after reorganizing my place and was honestly devastated. It was half empty after two months, but admittedly I’m a bit obsessive over eye cream and I use more than normal people do. Anyway, just ordered a second bottle. Neeeeeeeed!\n",
      "Line2943: This eye cream is AMAZING!! I use it as a night eye cream cause it's very moisturizing!! I wake up with bright eyes every morning...I'm almost out of my current one and need to repurchase another! But it does last a very long time!!\n",
      "Line2944: I have not been using this for a while but I have noticed that my one undereye wrinkle is less prominent and my eye area seems more moisturized. This is a great product if you want to moisturize your eye area and prevent eye wrinkles from forming. Belif is a great brand if you want a lot of hydration which every skin type loves. This is a little pricey but it's worth every penny and you get a good amount of product since you don't need that much moisturizer for the eye area. The texture is like a cream and gel consistency and melts into the skin easily. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a little hydration in their eye area.\n",
      "Line2945: A great every day eye cream, makes eye skin feel instantly moisturized and makes it easier for eyeshadows to stick.\n",
      "Line2946: I am so happy with this product! I am forever struggling with under eye issues. Either nothing works or it does not absorb into the skin very well! This did both! I notice smoother skin and less puff eyes than before! Also its gel based so it dries very quick!\n",
      "Line2947: My go to everyday eye cream. So hydrating!! Helps with my under eye puffiness and layers well with my other skin care products. I also use it on my elevens, and find it helps to tone down the fine lines there. Will absolutely repurchase!\n",
      "Line2948: I love this eye moisturizing cream! It lasts for so long. I started getting really dry skin by my eyelids and I put some of this cream on that area and it worked great! It kept my skin moisturized. I love that it works on sensitive skin. I would definitely recommend this product!\n",
      "Line2949: I love this product! It has a nice spa-like scent to it. It has certainly met my expectations. It’s gentle, applies so smoothly, and is effective. I would certainly buy again, and I would also recommend! I should also add, this is a very lightweight, but hydrating formula!\n",
      "Line2950: This eye cream is OK. I really liked it at first. It feels great to apply. However this eye cream piles up like no other! I’ve used every face cream I have with this stuff and it never absorbs. It just piles up into a bunch of little balls and rubs away. I wanted to love it!\n",
      "Line2951: Helps with softening fine lines and wrinkles! You definitely wake up with fresher eyes, it’s a very effective product!\n",
      "Line2952: This product did not provide any significant hydration to my eye area.  I still had bags and no improvement to my fine lines.\n",
      "Line2953: I give it 5 stars as a face primer not so much as an eye cream. It didn’t make a difference with my under eyes but as a face primer it worked well. Kept my face hydrated and my make up on longer.\n",
      "Line2954: Me encanta. No creía que una crema para hidrata sería capaz de reducir ojeras. La verdad es que si, lo hace!! Estoy muy feliz porque a pesar de que tengo ojeras por herencia, se han disminuido bastante.\n",
      "Line2955: This is so damn moisturizing duhhh hence the name but wowwww i was so impressed . The tiniest bit of this is all you need to dab on and your under eye makeup will be applied much better ! I loved it the first time i used it .\n",
      "Line2956: Over the course of the month I’ve had to try this (received a sample in my Sephora play) it has visibly increased the elasticity and moisture of my under eye area.  It doesn’t so much for bags but the lines and dryness are visibly reduced.  So much so that I bought the full size!\n",
      "Line2957: I really like using this under my eyes. I received a sample size and quickly upgraded to a larger size. This lead me to find belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb. Using them together with the belif Hungarian Water Essence underneath every night keeps my skin happy and hydrated all day.\n",
      "Line2958: It was ok and I have to be honest I didn't see much of a difference. I would not go out of my way to buy this at a store I don't think it's worth the money. Not different from much cheaper moisturizers.\n",
      "Line2959: This is the best moisturizing eye cream ever! I’m only missing it being de puffing. But i love when my eyes are feeling super dry and i can throw this on and instantly feel better. Amazing for under concealer! And it’s very big worth the price.\n",
      "Line2960: I love this eye cream! Absorbs well, deeply hydrating, and my entire area is much smoother & more hydrated! I'm fast approaching thirty, and this was a great first eye cream to incorporate into my routine to start caring for my eye area! *Highly* recommend!\n",
      "Line2961: This seemed to work well, no smell seemed to be very moisturizing . Con for me it's small for the price this should have been at least the same size jar as the moisturizer. I haven't decided if I would buy again\n",
      "Line2962: I am turning 32 and was looking as a crazy another moisturizing cream for muy under eyes, because I was using a product of L'ebel and was not enough, until I round this EYE BOMB. Simple, I love it.\n",
      "Line2963: I haven’t noticed a distinct difference with this eye cream, but it feels so refreshing under the eye.\n",
      "Line2964: I have this product it leaves my under eyes moisturized. It’s effective. And I recommend it and it’s a good value.\n",
      "Line2965: Love this brand. All their moisturizers are great! I've been using this eye bomb for a few weeks now and have noticed my eyes look less tired than before. I'm continuing to use this\n",
      "Line2966: Wasn’t the biggest fan of it. I didn’t really see that much of a difference is using this product, so I’m not sure it was the price tag. It definitely hydrated the under eye, but not enough for me to keep buying it.\n",
      "Line2967: This brand is absolutely amazing, for one!! It’s very gentle and does the job.  I typically use it when I do my night time skin care routine.. only purchased once, but I will buy this product again for sure\n",
      "Line2968: This is so amazing I can’t even explain it!! It is so moisturizing and just makes me feel so refreshed.\n",
      "Line2969: Feels good on application but my under eye area still felt dry after a short time. Didn't make a difference to my concealer application though.\n",
      "Line2970: I have been using this product for approximately three weeks now and I absolutely love it. It has a smooth and light consistency that spreads very easily and it leaves the skin around my eyes feeling bouncy and refreshed. The scent is lovely too.\n",
      "Line2971: It moisturized under my eye is seconds. It comes with a decent amount of product. I use this very often and when I run out and go buy some more. It is very gentle in the face and does not burn, harm your eyes.\n",
      "Line2972: I love this eye cream. My under eyes feel so moisturized and it has reduced the puffiness under my eyes. It is a little pricey though.\n",
      "Line2973: This eye cream is my favorite to give my undereyes a blast of hydration before going in with makeup.  It works so well. This product won't help with wrinkles but if you are going in with a more matte concealer use this beforehand and it won't dry out your undereyes causing those wrinkles to be exaggerated.\n",
      "Line2974: Not the best. I gave it some stars because the amount of product you get, fresh smell and light weight however I was disappointed because this made my eye break out like crazy and that has never happened. I dont know if it was just my skin or what but wont be trying again.\n",
      "Line2975: eye cream is so important, and this is one of my favorites! it’s so refreshing and cooling when applied. I feel that it’s very effective. it’s so gentle on the skin as well. I would recommend this for sure.\n",
      "Line2976: I  have very dry skin and using a lot of wrinkle creams, I found my skin needing a little extra TLC. During the day, my face gets very tight, especially around my eyes. This is a great eye moisturizer. It plumps up my skin and gives my skin a great deal of moisture with out being sticky or heavy.\n",
      "Line2977: Did not like this product made my skin irritated and had to discontinue use of the product\n",
      "Line2978: I love this product! It really moisturized my undereyes and there was a clear difference in comparison to other undereye products. Would purchase again.\n",
      "Line2979: The Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is my all time favorite eye cream that I have tried so far. It’s great to use in the day time under makeup. It’s not too thick or heavy at all. I believe it would be good for all skin types. If you haven’t tried it I definitely recommend giving this a try.\n",
      "Line2980: This eye product is one of my top 3 eye creams I use. I prefer this for daytime eye moisturizing. It adds an instant glow to your under-eye, love this for my makeup free days as well because it is so glowy on its own. Great for fine lines and puffiness, have noticed a gradual reduction in the prominence of my dark under eye circles as well with using this. One of my holy grail products! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line2981: I just started using this eye cream and it is phenomenal! Its so smooth and sort of depuffs my under eyes which I love\n",
      "Line2982: So I don't use this as an eye cream. I use it on the extra dry areas on my face and its great for hydration! I have very dry skin so I like anything that adds moisture.\n",
      "Line2983: I find that this is moisturizing and does go on smooth. I’m 36 years old and don’t have a major issue with lines or wrinkles but was looking to stay ahead of the game. I have not noticed a change in existing lines but didn’t have an issue with it in the first place.\n",
      "Line2984: I got this as a sample in my Sephora play box and it’s lasted me for months, which gives me high hopes that the full size jar will last me forever lol! It smells amazing and goes on without being too oily and I think it definitely makes a difference in fading out the dark circles a bit. I absolutely love this so much!!\n",
      "Line2985: I love this product. It's hydrating on my skin. It doesn't irritate my skin. I've been using this for the past month and I like it. It smells good and it's light on the skin.\n",
      "Line2986: The eye bomb is honestly the bomb. If you have drier skin and really enjoy products that truly moisturize without waking up the next morning with your eyes crusted together. This is your product. It soaks into the skin so quickly and within the first day or so you can tell a difference.\n",
      "Line2987: Love this eye moisturizer especially for the colder days and if you have very dry under eyes it will definitely kept your under eye moisturize with out being greasy and you just need the smallest amount this product will lash you forever !!!\n",
      "Line2988: Given that I'm 21 I feel like I don't necessarily need an eye cream but I got one in my playbox anyways. After using this product, I now want to wear eye cream, if its this. It's really really hydrating and is a thick texture when you're putting it on your face, but feels super light on your face. Its a nice cool touch on your face and really does feel great. I recently started getting really bad dry eyes and I have dry patches on my lids and eye brows and now under my water line. My face creams were useless in dealing with that but this fixed it up really well after using it once!\n",
      "Line2989: I really enjoyed this eye cream. The scent is light and fresh, and the container lasted me 6+ months, so I definitely think it's worth the price. It did a great job at keeping my eyes moisturized, but it didn't do much for my fine lines. I would buy again though.\n",
      "Line2990: Just started using it but I am in love. I am a teenager that has dark under eyes from lack of sleep but this lightens then and makes them super plump\n",
      "Line2991: I use this product every time after I get out of the shower in combination with the belif aqua bomb. It is incredibly hydrating for my under eyes and a little bit goes a long way. I would repurchase this again!\n",
      "Line2992: I love the way it made my under eyes look radiant. It took the puffiness away and the dark circles were lightened. I got this in my Sephora Play! box, but I’m considering purchasing it at a regular Sephora store. My Sephora at JC Penney doesn’t carry it.\n",
      "Line2993: This eye cream really works for your under eyes changes the elasticity makes under eyes look not wrinkly and takes away all dry patches and problems under the eyes. I love all belif skin care. I would purchase all belif skin care again.\n",
      "Line2994: This stuff has a great consistency and feel. Love putting this stuff on before bed for some overnight hydration!\n",
      "Line2995: My favorite eye cream of all time. It has a heavenly texture and works on both lids and under eye. I love the gel consistency, it’s hydrating without being heavy and didn’t cause any milia. I would definitely recommend\n",
      "Line2996: Amazing smell works great gives me a lot of moisture underneath my eyes also I received this in my Ipsy bag and it is a sample size but I still got a lot of use out of the jar that I was sent\n",
      "Line2997: Love itttt! I wear it every night to bed and my under eyes have been so much better! I always use my ring finger to gently apply it too. Very moisturizing and not too fragrant. I will definitely pick this up.\n",
      "Line2998: This product is amazing and so gentle and hydrating on your under eyes. I would definitely repurchase and recommend to friends. The price you pay is worth the quality of the product.\n",
      "Line2999: Got a sample from a ipsy package and it felt really creamy and refreshing on the under eyes.\n",
      "Line3000: Are use this every single night, I've had it for about eight months now. It's very large dries it without being heavy or greasy. It absorbs quite fast, which I like because I don't feel I don't like the feeling of product sitting on my face.\n",
      "Line3001: This eye cream does not feel heavy or sticky! It glides on your skins and you see a difference within 2 days.\n",
      "Line3002: Has really done a lot for my undereyes, I usually apply it in the morning and it instantly brightens and hydrates. The only eye cream that I use!\n",
      "Line3003: This eye cream is amazing. Its lightweight but very hydrating with little to no scent! I would definitely recommend this and I'm obsessed with the packaging!\n",
      "Line3004: I love the way this feels under the eyes. Very moisturizing and lightweight. I only got a small size . I fell in love with another skincare brand so I am giving their eye cream a try, but I may still buy another small size bacause this stuff feels so good.\n",
      "Line3005: I love this product. I got it in my Ipsy bag and ended up buying the full size because I loved it. It feels so cooking and is perfect for summer. I always forget to put sunscreen on my eyelids and under my eyes and this soothes them so much if they get a little sunburnt. It makes your concealer go in flawlessly. I will probably buy this again when I run out.\n",
      "Line3006: Amazing ! Love this product! Love the application and the way it feels on the face! Little pricey!\n",
      "Line3007: I LOVE this eye cream. I'm only 19 so I'm not worried about aging eyes but my under eyes get really dry and this eye cream is wonderful. It's really smooth and soaks into my skin fast leaving my under eyes feeling great.\n",
      "Line3008: J’ai enfin trouvé Le contour des yeux! Excellent en base de maquillage je n’ai plus le contour des yeux marqués même en poudrant\n",
      "Line3009: It felt really nice once it soaked Into the skin and it made my under eyes very smooth. I got it off Ipsy and I really like it. And it made my expectations bc i rarely use eye creams and it could work more with under eye bags\n",
      "Line3010: I cannot give this product enough of a rave review. It’s a life changing, game changing product. The most amazing amount of moisture in the tiniest amount of product - my eyes feel instantly quenched, my fine lines plump up and hide, and once it settle in your skin, it acts as the best under eye primer before makeup. Heaven. On. Earth.\n",
      "Line3011: This eye bomb applies on like a light cream, and it’s pretty nice, but I have experienced some stinging irritation from time to time, especially when I had more compromised, overexfoliated skin.  I have a rather large sample of this that I got from a Belif set, which was nice to try. I still use it from time to time, but I haven’t yet fully committed to eye creams just yet.   Unsure of its actual benefits after a few months of use, but it’s a fun product if you don’t get the stinging.  via CosDNA: Potential acne triggers: Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Dimethicone, PEG-100 Stearate Potential irritants: Carbomer\n",
      "Line3012: This is very moisturising and cooling. It feels great to apply. It has a gel like consistency and a great smell.\n",
      "Line3013: I have heard so many good things about the Belif line so I decided to pick up a trial size to try a few of the products out. This was my go-to for a good few months while using the trial size because a little goes a long way. When I first applied this, it kind of stung (but cooled) under my eyes. After a few times of applying it, the stinging went away and I was left with just a cooling sensation. This absorbs quickly into the under eye, but I did notice that towards the inner corner of my eye, it tends to ball up and makes it harder to spread out. This moisturizer definitely kept my under eyes from being dry and my under eye makeup from looking cakey.\n",
      "Line3014: Got this in an Influenster box and fell in love, some of the best moisturizer I’ve ever used in my life.\n",
      "Line3015: This is a great moisturizing eye bomb. It leaves my eyes feeling refreshed and smooth. Mg undereyes also look less puffy.\n",
      "Line3016: Does what it promises to do— moisturizes! Application of under eye concealer goes on smoothly after using this eye bomb. I haven’t seen any other effects besides the moisturizing though. Wish it did more brightening or depuffing, but I guess I’ll have to try another eye cream for that.\n",
      "Line3017: I loooooooove this product! It moisturizers your under eye and makeup application afterwards is a dream! I use it at night and before I do my makeup.\n",
      "Line3018: Very hydrating. Doubles as a moisturizer and eye shadow primer. I love a “one stop shop” type of product! A little goes a very long way. Love this stuff\n",
      "Line3019: so far so good... have only used a few times Will need to use for a few weeks at least to tell the difference, if any.\n",
      "Line3020: Seems to keep the sensitive eye area moisturized & doesn't clog pores. I got mine in a sephora beauty bag , so it's small but it has lasted forever.\n",
      "Line3021: I received a deluxe sample of this eye cream and liked it. It has a nice fresh scent and feels moisturizing under the eyes without being too heavy. It’s a little pricey but I’d consider buying it full sized when I have a little extra cash for a splurge.\n",
      "Line3022: I didnt want to buy into the hype of this one because of the price point and most people say you don't need a separate eye cream but omg I love this. I have 46 year old skin and have very slight lines and this helps plump them right up and keeps the under eye mositurised. This will last a while because so little is needed but will definitely repurchase when I am done.\n",
      "Line3023: Very moisturizing! I received a sample from ipsy and I really like it. It made my under eyes smooth and the formula is gentle for sensitive skin.\n",
      "Line3024: Love this eye cream. I can tell a huge difference in the hydration of my undereyes. Does not leave me oily at all. Soaks into the skin fine and doesn’t cause makeup to cake up or separate. Would definitely recommend to someone with dry eye areas.\n",
      "Line3025: This is a really nice eye cream. I got a small trial in a beauty box an it's lasted a really long time. A little bit goes a long way. Very hydrating without irritating my eyes.\n",
      "Line3026: Just received this on my ipsy. I just love this product. It leaves your eyes look super.\n",
      "Line3027: This feels great when you put it on!  Helps with my tired eyes!   Doesn’t take much to do the job so it goes a long way!\n",
      "Line3028: Where do I begin?? I suffer from dry...super dry under eye...i was on the search for an eye cream at Sephora and came across this brand. I gave it a go because I also saw Casey Holmes loved it so purchased it. And omg it’s perfection! Sinks into my skin and seriously feels instantly hydrated. I use this at night and even before I put on my concealer. It makes for the perfect primer! I definitely am a belifer!\n",
      "Line3029: I received this in my ipsy bag and a little goes a long way! I only have to dip the pad of my finger in a little bit to get a good amount of product. It smells really nice and feels good on my under eyes. I put this on in the morning and at night and find that it's nice to wear under makeup to keep my skin feeling hydrated and healthy.\n",
      "Line3030: I’ve been using a sample size of this eye bomb which is lasting me a few weeks now. I only use a little. It is lightweight and sets quickly without leaving a greasy residue. It is definitely moisturizing so it does what it says. I’ve enjoyed using it but if you’re concerned about wrinkles, I don’t think this will do much. It’s more hydrating than a cream to get rid of wrinkles. It would work best in the summertime or dry weather because it’s lightweight so for dryer under eye area, you’d need a thicker cream.\n",
      "Line3031: OMG. This is a super moisturizing eye cream.  It is light weight, which I love, and it soaks in super fast.  I don't have to sit there waiting for it to dry before putting my eye makeup, so it saves me a lot of time.  Ever since using it I noticed my under eye has been more moisturized, which is my main concern, cause I noticed that the previous eye cream I was using was not working so great.  If it really hot out, I like to put this in the refrigerator, and applied it in the morning for a refreshing wake up call.  Will definitely repurchase.\n",
      "Line3032: This stuff leaves nothing dehydrated under my very dry eyes. I have problems with my concealer turning creasy after about 3 hours but I made it 9 whole hours before it even started to turn creasy and I've noticed my dark circles are almost gone after only 2 weeks. This stuff is beyond amazing and I think yall should try it.\n",
      "Line3033: I definitely notice a difference in my under-eye area. When I don’t use the cream, my eye bags are more pronounced. This cream has minimized the lines under my eyes. I also apply this cream to the “parenthesis” lines on the side of my mouth and it works really well there too!\n",
      "Line3034: I think it is a nice eye cream if hydration is your only concern. I did not feel like it did much more than that. It last for ever. I got it as part of a gift set\n",
      "Line3035: I could give this cream 10 stars if that was an option! I love it so so so much! It’s insanely hydrating and stays on all day. It has improved the skin around my eyes and I don’t look so tired all the time now. I love it!!\n",
      "Line3036: I was so excited to try this I thought it was gonna fix all my eye problems but after a month of use I really didn’t notice any difference at all. I was super disappointed so the eye cream search continues.\n",
      "Line3037: I have noticed a huge difference since using this cream! I wear makeup almost every day, and before applying it, I put the belif moisturizing eye bomb and it makes a huge difference! I don't get the ugly creases or crows feet on my eyes! I'm a huge believer in this cream! Highly recommend!\n",
      "Line3038: I have very oily and dry skin so eye cream can be a toss-up for me.  Either it leaves my under eye very oily, or doesn't help enough.  This eye cream really sinks in and moisturizers.  Highly recommend!\n",
      "Line3039: This eye cream has become my new favorite. Soooo good! It soaks right in and leaves my under eyes feeling hydrated and refreshed. Use it in the AM and PM and works well with makeup.\n",
      "Line3040: How could you not love this product!! It’s by far my most favorite eye cream I’ve ever used. It’s so great for dry under eye area and leaves you going to bed feeling cool and moisturized. I definitely recommend.\n",
      "Line3041: Very moisturizing. It sinks into the skin relatively quickly and makeup sits well on top of it.\n",
      "Line3042: Nice consistency and absorbs fine but doesn't seem to do anything more than the regular moisturizing cream.\n",
      "Line3043: This is not my favorite eye cream.  My eyes would water when using this eye cream.  I do not have a problem with other eye creams.  It did keep that area moisturized nicely, but I don't want to tear up every time I use a product.  Because of this, I will not repurchase this item.\n",
      "Line3044: I received a sample of this and I’ve only been using it for a few days, but I do notice a difference. It doesn’t do much for firming, but it is super hydrating. So if that’s the only thing you’re aiming for, I would recommend this!\n",
      "Line3045: This is a great eye cream! I had dry spots under my eyes and within 2 uses it helped take it away. A little goes a long way which is nice because it is a little expensive for my liking for such a little amount of product. It's easy to apply, the jar it comes in is nice and easy to open.\n",
      "Line3046: I love this eye cream! I don’t really have much creasing yet but my undereyes can get somewhat dry throughout the day and this cream is great at hydrating! It sits well under makeup concealer and my eyes still look good when I get home from work. I would recommend it\n",
      "Line3047: I am 25 years old about to turn 26,  it’s time for me to start using an eye cream.  I got a sample of this through Ipsy, it was very gentle and hydrating.  The sample size was a great size, and after checking the pricing, I decided I’d buy the full.  My under eye area looks much better after using this for a week!\n",
      "Line3048: I absolutely love this eye cream. I use it twice a day. The packaging looks super classy on my bathroom counter too!! It is super moisturizing and leaves my eyes looking super bright! I will always use this product!\n",
      "Line3049: I’ve only used this product a few times. It does so well in moisturizing and cooling my under eyes, but it does not really help with dark under eyes.\n",
      "Line3050: I use this before bed and occasionally in the morning when my skin feels extra dry. It helps keeping my under eye moist so that my makeup doesn’t flake and look Cakey dry. I recommend and price wise it’s worth it. Just a little dab goes a long way.\n",
      "Line3051: This is a hydrating eye mask without being tacky or greasy. It is easily absorbed into skin, and it feels like it cools and de-puffs the eye area. It works well under makeup and as a night eye cream. I would repurchase.\n",
      "Line3052: Belif makes such great products. I generally shy away from things that come in little pots but I absolutely love this cream..I use it every night before bed under my eyes.\n",
      "Line3053: The texture of eye creams is so important to me and this one just glides on. So moisturizing!\n",
      "Line3054: What can I say, I love the stuff. Not only does it smell amazing but it’s extremely hydrating, very gentle and good for a contact lens wearers. My only gripe is that it is $48 for less than 1 ounce. I tend to be a bit heavy-handed when it comes to skin care especially eye cream and I feel like I ran through my tub of this extremely quickly I’m debating whether to re-purchase this or try something a little bit cheaper considering I’m still under the age of 30.\n",
      "Line3055: This eye bomb is very moisturizing. I can definitely see a difference in my under eyes. I had been looking into eye creams and this one is great.\n",
      "Line3056: Works well to moisturize the under eye region, keeps hydration around the eyes and gives off a dewy healthy glow. Smells good and is a nice texture. Could possibly repurchase when I run out of my current tub.\n",
      "Line3057: This product smells divine and lasts for AGES. It is definitely a moisturizing product and I felt like the eye area looked fresher and somehow, less gaunt. I’m giving it four stars because I believe there is room for improvement. I would like this product to offer more benefits because some of my big concerns are wrinkles and I don’t feel that the eye bomb addresses that as much as other eye creams. For a general moisturizer, it’s great. If you have trouble with crows feet, you might want to find a more powerful cream.\n",
      "Line3058: There is a reason this is the #1 eye cream! It is so good. I am a 22 year old college student who has had their fair share of late nighters. However, when I use this under my eyes at night you can't tell at all. It is expensive, but it is one of the few skincare products that I think it worth the price. Highly recommend, even for those in their twenties who don't think they need an eye cream yet!\n",
      "Line3059: This is by far the best moisturizer I’ve ever used for my eyes. It leaves your under eyes feeling so soft and smooth. The biggest bonus is you only need the tiniest bit each use, so the bottle will last forever!\n",
      "Line3060: I absolutely love this eye cream. It’s really lightweight and basically melts right into your skin. It doesn’t leave any residue so you can wear during the day. I wear it with the aqua bomb moisturizer and my skin is so soft. I will definitely be repurchasing.\n",
      "Line3061: Such a beautiful and moisturizing eye cream!!! I cannot day enough good things about this product! Sephora sells amazing bundle deals where you can get deluxe size samples to try out the brand before you buy. I’d go that route before committing to a full size when it comes to any skincare product.\n",
      "Line3062: I love this eye product! I've tried a few in the past and they did absolutely nothing or gave me a rash but this one keeps my under eyes so hydrated and nice!!\n",
      "Line3063: Hands down the best eye moisturizer I've used. It's very gentle and immediately absorbs into the skin. My concealer always looks so smooth and creaseless whenever I used this. Will continue to repurchase!\n",
      "Line3064: Amazing! My makeup applies so much better with this on! My under eyes are much more hydrated and plump.\n",
      "Line3065: A little of this goes a long way. Which makes it an awesome value. It is super hydrating and gentle on the under eye area. I found it to be extremely effective. I would not only recommend to others but am about to order another one!\n",
      "Line3066: My favorite eye cream I love it!. The first time when I used was Thai you to Sephora play and omg I had to go to Sephora and buy the biggest size is amaizing I strongly recommend this cream!. You will see the result quickly!. Less dryness more beautiful eye skin!.\n",
      "Line3067: I received this as a sample size from Sephora, and I absolutely love it! It provides so much hydration under my eyes, but is so lightweight. I also love that there is no heavy scent to this product. If you pop this in the fridge before applying, it feels nice and refreshing early in the morning. This is a morning must have for me!\n",
      "Line3068: Love this. One of the nicest eye treatments i have used. I only wish it was cruelty free.  Super moisturizing and not oily at all.\n",
      "Line3069: Moisturizes skin and moisturizes area under eye Keep skin moisturized for a long time you can put this cream berfore the foundation\n",
      "Line3070: LOVE! I will definitely be purchasing this product again. The smell is incredible and moisturizes without leaving my skin oily or shiny. The cream is light and easily moveable for smooth coverage and blending. Incredible product.\n",
      "Line3071: I first received the Belief Eye Bomb in a value set from Sephora. I love it. It is great when your eyes are feeling dry and helps with the blending of my concealer. I will say I feel it helps reduce the dark circles under my eye but it is not that great for antiageing. Still, I would recommend it as a great moisturizing eye cream.\n",
      "Line3072: This is a super hydrating and brightening eye moisturizer! Use it everyday and no fine lines or wrinkles!\n",
      "Line3073: Holy Grail eye cream. I love it. It’s more like a gel. I’m able to use it under my makeup with no problem. It doesn’t give me those little white bumps. I love everything I’ve used from Belif, I will continue to repurchase and recommend this product.\n",
      "Line3074: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb does moisturize skin around the eyes. It feels great, doesn't irritate or doesn't makes skin greasy. It leaves skin soft and smooth. Love it!\n",
      "Line3075: This really moisturizes the under eye area but I think it is a little too thick for me. I got a sample in my Sephora Play box a few months ago and I still have over half left since I don’t want to put too much on. If I do, it ends up just clumping up and looking weird.\n",
      "Line3076: I absolutely LOVE this eye cream. It’s so light yet so moisturising. I have a dry undereye area and I have tried so many oils and serums before but this has worked the best so far! BUY IT! Absolutely recommend this to anyone who want brighter and a smoother eye area!\n",
      "Line3077: This eye bomb is amazing I use it every night after my shower along with the belif true cream moisturizing bomb. I went into a Sephora and had help finding this because I had really bad dark under eye spots but I can honestly say they're getting a lot better and I will never stop using this\n",
      "Line3078: Worked great on my under eyes.  There was a lot of product for the small container. It helped my eyelids as well to prepare them for my makeup routine.\n",
      "Line3079: This product I got as a sample from Sephora. It is a light gel texture which easily absorbs in the skin. It gives the eyes a hydrated but not heavy feeling so I think it is best for combo or oily skin. The texture makes it easy to apply makeup after\n",
      "Line3080: I got this cream in my ipsy bag this month. I used it under my eyes and oh my god the cream is so moisturising and soothing. I never realised I needed an eye cream until I used this and felt a huge difference. I loved it and would be buying more of it.\n",
      "Line3081: Received this in my Ipsy bag and OMG, I love this cream. It feels so good when you put this on in the morning, pretty effective for puffy eyes, smells and feels fresh. Would definitely buy again\n",
      "Line3082: This is like a magic worker to my eyes. Usually I have dark circle that are super notifing. This eye cream helps a lot during those awful dark circle days.\n",
      "Line3083: This is going to be fairly confusing based on my review, but this is a good eye cream. It’s very basic and an amazing price. It’s really moisturizing for the under eye area, unfortunately I don’t need moisture as much as brightening. But for everyone who just needs a little moisture for your eyes, give this gem a try!\n",
      "Line3084: Omg love this eye cream! I don’t think I can live without it. It feels amazing and makes me look like I’ve had hours of sleep even when I’m exhausted! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line3085: This is by far my favorite eye moisturizer. Not only do I already love their face Aqua Bomb, but being able to try out the Eye Bomb, was awesome. The scent is amazing and the touch and feel of the product are great. I love this product and will continue to use it in my cleansing routine from now on.\n",
      "Line3086: The name for this product is perfect cuz it is a moisture bomb right for your face it feels so moist Rising hence the name it's a can't do no wrong product my book.\n",
      "Line3087: I LOVE this eye cream!! I got a sample from Ipsy and am so tempted to buy the full size, even with the higher price tag than I would typically spend. I've tried other eye creams and this is by far my favorite. It's so moisturizing which is the number one thing I look for in an eye cream. A lot of other eye creams are harsh on my sensitive skin and this could not be gentler. I'm also a huge fan of the scent, almost a light citrusy scent,\n",
      "Line3088: This product is okay. I think it moisturizes my undereyes but I dont feel like it's the absolute best like the aqua bomb is.\n",
      "Line3089: Want to love it but eh. It works well but not thick enough for a lasting crease less day. It tends to oxidize my concealer unless I use this at night or let it dry before applying my concealer on.\n",
      "Line3090: I love the cool feeling you get when you put this on. It was well worth the price point because you don’t have to put a lot on for the intense hydration. Love it.\n",
      "Line3091: This stuff is amazing! I didn't even think I had dry eyes to begin with, but this eye moisturizer completely blew me away. I wear it every day AM and PM. A little goes a long way, so this will last me a long time.\n",
      "Line3092: So good! South Florida is humid so I don’t have to worry too much about dry skin. However, when I use matte make up I always refreshed my under eyes with this moisturizer!\n",
      "Line3093: As a sensitive skin sufferer, I've got to hand it to them that this is the only eye product I've used that doesn't cause my eyes to burn and water. It's very hydrating and my new go to eye cream.\n",
      "Line3094: this stuff is amazing!!! i got a sample in my ipsy bag & I loved it. it was instantly refreshing and felt as if it was instantly tightening my under eye. the only reason I give it four stars is because if I didn’t get a sample I probably wouldn’t have bought it myself because it’s so expensive!\n",
      "Line3095: I love the intense burst of moisture from this eye product. It is light weight so I usually use it in combination with an eye cream to lock in that hydration. I would purchase this again.\n",
      "Line3096: I recently purchased this...so I’ve only been using it for a week but I am quite impressed. I’ve been using La Mer for at least a year but purchased this after reading great reviews on it under makeup. I am hooked!\n",
      "Line3097: This I cream is absolutely amazing every single time I use it I feel like my under eyes are completely hydrated. It is also a great primer for concealer. I wish it wasn’t so expensive! But I would definitely buy again\n",
      "Line3098: Seriously LOVE this. Super hydrating and smooth. Lasts all day. Smells great and doesn't break me out or feel greasy.\n",
      "Line3099: I received this from a subscription box and love it! This is probably my new favorite eye cream. It feels really good when you put it on and is very hydrating. It only takes a small amount of product. I'll buy again.\n",
      "Line3100: I just got a deluxe sample size of this eye cream in my June 2018 ipsy bag but had otherwise never heard of it. I've been using it for about a week and can say that it is very moisturizing without being super thick or sticky. It also blends easily and works with concealer so there are no streaks or patches.\n",
      "Line3101: I use this product daily. It helps my concerler go on nicely, however I don’t know that it does much for your skin.  It does not claim to be anti-aging or anything, it seems more like an under eye moisturizer. I do like it though! Again great for under your makeup.\n",
      "Line3102: I LOVE THIS EYE CREAM! If you have dry under eyes you need this! It’s so hydrating and doesn’t make your concealer look cakey at all!! I love it! Will purchase forever!\n",
      "Line3103: Received a pot of this eye cream with one of my beauty subscription boxes recently. The consistency wasn’t as rich and creamy as I’ve come to expect from an eye cream, so initially my expectations were low. I continued to use it as part of my nightly routine. A little goes a long way, so it took about a month for me to finish the sample pot. That was a week ago, and only now am I realizing just how much it improved the appearance of my under-eye skin! My concealer, foundation, powder, etc. didn’t crease or look cakey and dry. If it weren’t for the semi-steep price tag, I would already own a new pot. Definitely changed my perspective on eye creams.\n",
      "Line3104: This is sooo moisturizing! I need it and I love it. I sometimes have excema on my eye lids and this helps so much. Bc my eye lid skin is think and well on my eye ball I cannot use a steroid cream there. This cream does the trick. It leaves my eye area moisturized, dewy and luminous. I highly recommend for Angie with dry areas around their eye!! I took off one star bc I wish it also had anti aging benefits. It definitely smooths what I already have but I don’t think it prevents anything. I always use a stronger anti aging product at night.\n",
      "Line3105: This can be used at night or in the morning. It’s just so soft and refreshing. It’s not harsh at all.\n",
      "Line3106: I use this day and night and put a little bit on but a little bit goes a long way. It is a bit pricey but it will do the job and has a long term effect, the packaging is amazing but I do wish that it was a little bit cheaper so I can buy it in bulk! other than that its amazing!\n",
      "Line3107: Love this hydrating eye cream. I first got it as a sample at Sephora but had to purchase the full size because it worked so well. It has a gel like consistency, very light weight, and works wonders under makeup. It hydrates and smooths my under eye area and reduces the look of fine lines. I’m not sure I’ve noticed long term affects or changes in my under eye lines, but this keeps the under eyes hydrated upon application.\n",
      "Line3108: I love love love this eye cream! This is for sure my favorite eye cream and I would 200% recommend this eye cream! I don’t think that you can get a better eye cream than this eye cream. I think that this is the best eye cream I have ever tried!\n",
      "Line3109: This seems like nothing special and it does what it claims. With saying that, I can tell when I don’t use it and I love he texture!! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line3110: I really enjoyed using this eye balm. I think the packaging is very cute and effective for the product. This product did meet my expectations and feels very nice on the eyes. The price is a little high in my opinion but I received a small sample size in my sephora play bag.\n",
      "Line3111: Nice gel formula for under eye area. I like the fact that they honestly tell that it is just a moisturizer. Because I feel like all the other under eye moisturizers claim to do so much but really don’t do anything but moisturize. This one is working well and a jar lasts forever. Good value.\n",
      "Line3112: I use the eye bomb every morning and night, especially if I’m wearing makeup. It smoothes out and moisturizes my under eyes. My concealer goes on smooth and creases way less throughout the day verses when I don’t use the cream.\n",
      "Line3113: I got a trial size to try and it’s being doing what it claims to do. It’s definitely moisturizing and under eyes do feel much healthier in the morning. But that’s it, I don’t think it does anything beyond providing moisture for my under eyes. I think there are other products out there in the similar price range that provide more benefits\n",
      "Line3114: I wanted to love this so bad. This really fills in fine lines and I can notice a difference almost instantly. However, this gives me terrible milia under my eyes. After three uses my under eyes looked horrible. If you have extremely sensitive under eyes like me I would stay away from this eye cream.\n",
      "Line3115: This works!!!  I've been using it for two days and I can see the difference within a hour of using it its worth the price I have dark circles and there almost gone\n",
      "Line3116: I recently discovered the skincare brand Belif and I absolutely love their products especially how lightweight they feel on the face and hydrating.\n",
      "Line3117: This stuff is AMAZING. I don’t really need an eye bomb so I have to go my mom and she noticed drastic changes to her under eye bags. Plus it smells absolutely awesome.\n",
      "Line3118: Product leaves the under moisturizing and leaves under eye area feeling hydrated.  If I had a party-harry weekend and when Monday comes around my body is dying of thirst inside this definitely gives my eyes a boost of hydration. Not often do I get dehydrated but when I do I definitely go to this product to pick me back up.\n",
      "Line3119: I love this stuff! It feels so nice under the eye area, definitely a must for any skin care routine!\n",
      "Line3120: I only tried a sample of this cuz I’m too cheap lol but I really liked this and if the price wasn’t so expensive I’d buy 100\n",
      "Line3121: I’ve been using this product for the past couple months and I love it!!! I got this as part of an Influenster campaign. It leaves my skin and under eyes looking refreshed and bright! I would definitely buy this product again!\n",
      "Line3122: Originally got it (along with the rest of the line) because it was one of the first Korean products In sephora (yes, I'm korean) - not expecting too much. But it's amazing!\n",
      "Line3123: In love with this. I've been looking for a serum for my eyes and this might just be it. A little bit goes a long way, as with most serums. It absorbs well and smells awesome. I received a sample and I'm going to use it all up to see how the long term use affects my skin. If it's helping with my fine lines, I'm buying for sure!\n",
      "Line3124: The best eye cream!! Seriously it is so hydrating and I use it morning and night. It even works well under my makeup. I have never used an eye cream that I enjoy as much. Even Casey Holmes is raving about this!!\n",
      "Line3125: I love this eye moisturizer.. it really does leave your under eye feeling hydrated and soft. I use this both morning and night and I’ve found that it works well under concealer. It won’t help with dark circles if that’s what you are needing. I have very dry skin and really appreciate what this does for me.\n",
      "Line3126: Love love love this eye cream, it is so incredibly light and very effective. I think this eye cream is an absolute must. I have oily skin and struggle finding eye creams that don't make me more oily or make my makeup crease during the day.\n",
      "Line3127: Un très  bon produit qui hydrate bien le contour de l'oeil et procure une sensation de fraîcheur. Foncez\n",
      "Line3128: This product worked quite well. It felt very moisturizing and nourishing under the eyes and made them feel soft and smooth. I can’t attest to any long term effects since I do not feel I am old enough to see the benefits of an eye cream, I do think it is good to start using one early on and this one in particular is great.\n",
      "Line3129: I’ve struggled to find a good eye cream, and this takes the cake! It’s so moisturizing and my concealer goes on beautifully over this. You only need the smallest amount so although it’s pricy, it will last awhile. It’s a great formula for anyone with fine lines and dryness!\n",
      "Line3130: I used this product for a month stray. After a long day applying this on felt very refreshing. The next day I didn’t see a huge difference but the skin was a bit brighter. I do like to bring this when I travel.\n",
      "Line3131: Love have this eye balm just glides on the skin leaving it so silky and moisturized. I received this in a Sephora play box and wouldn’t definitely purchase this again. Use this at night and wake up well refreshed under eyes.\n",
      "Line3132: This was a very good product that delivered long lasting under eye moisture. I received it in a Sephora kit. I am considering buying it to use again because I was happy with the results.\n",
      "Line3133: I love belif and I love eye creams! A little of this cream goes a long way. It is thick and creamy but seems to absorb nicely. The texture is great overall and my skin feels so moisturized and soft. The scent is not overpowering at all, but pleasant. I love it.\n",
      "Line3134: I got this as a sephora play sample and I absolutely love it. Super hydrating and smells really good!\n",
      "Line3135: this stuff is great. i use this at night. i feel like it does hydrate my under eyes. it doesn’t do anything for the puffiness but i really just need it for hydration. a little bit goes a long way too. i would recommend this product!\n",
      "Line3136: I used to have super dry under eyes. Noticed this because when I applied makeup on it they would look AWFUL. Saw many reviews on this cream and is safe to say, I am never letting it go. It is BOMB AF\n",
      "Line3137: The packaging is beautiful. It’s a blue frosted glass with a plastic black screw on lid. This was my first time using it and I feel like it was a bit disappointing. I personally wouldn’t buy it again. It’s expensive but doesn’t live up to my expectations. It smells refreshing but doesn’t hydrate as well as I thought it would; especially, because of its price. I’ve tried more inexpensive products that work better than this.\n",
      "Line3138: Just loved! It really makes good for your skin, it hydrates and smells good, the finishing is not shining, the pack is nice and im gonna buy it again! You can find it at Sephora and online! Recommending to everyone!\n",
      "Line3139: Wonderful hydrating moisturizer for the eye! I love putting it on right after I wash my face and put on a face moisturizer -- makes me feel super pampered. Rubs in very easy and has a pleasantly mild scent. I am still young but worried about those creeping crow's feet, so just trying to delay it as much as I can by moisturizing often!\n",
      "Line3140: I love this brand and every-time i get a sample in a subscription box i make it last! This brand is amazing!\n",
      "Line3141: This was great! I am always looking for a new eye cream and this impressed. I use it at night and wake up with moistured under eyes\n",
      "Line3142: I’ve been using the eye bomb for about two weeks now. I haven’t noticed a tremendous amount of difference yet but it definitely hydrates and fills in my fine lines around my eyes. I love the texture of it and it sinks right into my skin.  *Update!!! The eye bomb is definitely the bomb! My fine lines around my eyes and in between my nose have significantly been reduced.\n",
      "Line3143: It's pretty good but not really excellent. I can feel it moisturizes the skin under my eyes but not that much compared to another eye cream I have tried and used.\n",
      "Line3144: This eye cream is definitely super hydrating. I do not have major eye concerns so I cannot say if it helps with dark spots or wrinkles but if you’re looking for hydration I think that this would be great and it’s very gentle and light.\n",
      "Line3145: Such a lightweight, yet super hydrating formula! Easy to open, and easy to use! I love the gentle formula that hydrated for 26 hours! It’s still hydrating when I reapply! I even got a compliment during my Sephora perk facial about the skin around my eyes! Hello! Major confidence boost! Love this and so do my eyes!\n",
      "Line3146: This is an amazing eye cream!! Easily one of the best ones that I’ve used. It’s a little pricey, however it does last a long time. I bought mine at Sephora for the first time! I would recommend this to others!\n",
      "Line3147: I LOVE this, I got it in a Sephora play and it was everything I had been looking for! For the first few times I used it I LOVED it! But I found that it just isn’t a good value for the price when you have dry skin! Sorry 😑belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line3148: Absolutely loved this cream I received. It smelled good and had a nice texture to it and a little went a long way. I’m not sure that I would pay full price for it but I really enjoyed it.\n",
      "Line3149: I love this product. It’s super hydrating for my under eye. I highly suggest this product for anyone with extra dry under eyes. I always use it before I apply my makeup and it goes on seamlessly.\n",
      "Line3150: I love belifs ingredients, smell, packaging, texture, everything but the results of this eye cream. Left my sensitive skin with Milia dots under and around the corners of the eyes. Would not repurchase.\n",
      "Line3151: Everything about this brand is amazing! Bought a travel size and this came with it. Such a great product! It def works!\n",
      "Line3152: I have tried tons of under eye creams looking for one that will reduce the dryness. This is one of the best I have  tried so far.\n",
      "Line3153: I have oily skin but I do still feel like my under eyes need hydration. I use this day and night and it’s seriously amazing! I feel like my under-eyes are so moisturized and helps a ton when applying concealer under the eyes.\n",
      "Line3154: I've tried this product a few times and haven't noticed a difference. It does hydrate but in combination with the moisture bomb moisturizer you can't tell where the hydration comes from, the eye cream or the moisturizer.\n",
      "Line3155: I have dry skin and slightly thinning skin under my eyes. I never used to bother with under-eye creams/lotions, relying on my regular moisturizer to do the job, as I never saw any difference when using a specific moisturizer for under the eyes. Until I found this.  I received a sample size jar and figured I’d give it a try, especially since I received it in the winter time when all my skin was at its driest and needed all the help it could get.  Although I find this cream light and absorbing enough to wear under makeup, I mostly use it in my night time routine and am continually surprised how good my eyes are looking when I wake up in the morning.  This will now have a permanent place in my must-haves. I highly recommend trying it out, especially if no other under eye product seems to make a difference to your skin.\n",
      "Line3156: I really like this eye cream. It absorbs fast and isn’t greasy. It’s pretty pricey but a little goes a long way! This is my first time trying it and I would buy it again.\n",
      "Line3157: I use this in the morning prior to makeup. I give it enough time to absorb and it keeps my concealer from creasing. Feels cool and nice going on. Doesnt feel greasy or take forever to absorb.\n",
      "Line3158: My go to eye cream! This stuff is so light feeling and just glides onto my skin. Keeps my under eye area moisturized all day/night. By far the best eye cream I’ve tried yet. I’ve gotten many compliments from others saying I’ve looked more awake lately (I’m definitely not, I have a two year old son) and my fine lines are less noticeable. I swear it’s the eye bomb! Definitely expensive.. but totally worth the splurge!\n",
      "Line3159: Using this eye cream right now and I am very happy with it. Highly moisturizing, sinks in beautifully, and layers well under makeup.\n",
      "Line3160: I LOVEEEEE this moisturizer. It has helped my under eyes feel refreshed and HYDRATED. I also use this as a primer for those days that I haven’t slept and it definitely helps with my lines.\n",
      "Line3161: My boyfriend actually received this as a sample on his last purchase of the moisturizing bomb (we are both HUGE belif fans) and boy it does not disappoint. Just like their moisturizers, the eye cream feels like a big drink of water for your skin. And it KEEPS your skin feeling fresh all day. No harsh scents, and very gentle. I keep this in my freelancing kit!\n",
      "Line3162: This product was amazing for my undereyes. I got it as a sample in a sephora set and I cherished it to the last little drop. It's thick but not too thick that you can't wear it under makeup. It just feels super refreshing under the eyes and so moisturizing. The only thing that is going to keep me from repurchasing this is that Belif is not cruelty free which is really disappointing because I really enjoyed this product.\n",
      "Line3163: I love this product it definitely does the job on hydrating my eyes. I tend to use this product more in the winter than the spring because I am obsessed with Ole Henriksen Banana Bright Eye Creme. Overall, I recommend this product to everyone as a must try or have in your skincare cabinet !!!\n",
      "Line3164: I have struggled for years to find a moisturizing eye cream that actually works and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin and I have finally found it! This stuff is a cream/gel texture and I didn’t think it would hydrate as much as it does. After just 3 uses, my dry patches under my eyes completely disappeared. My eyes feel hydrated and it’s thin enough that it works under makeup. Completely worth the money!!!\n",
      "Line3165: So moisturizing and a little goes a long way! I still am battling the fine lines under my eyes, but I am hopeful about the eye bomb. I love how my under eye feels after applying and with time I feel I will see more improvement with fine lines as I have only been using this for a week or so.\n",
      "Line3166: This stuff is great! I love how moisturizing it is under my eyes. I use it day and night! It’s not greasy feeling and my concealer goes on great over it!\n",
      "Line3167: So grateful that influenster sent me this to try out. It's been a hot minute since I've been using it and the difference in my under eyes is tremendous. My under eyes are so hydrated thanks to this product and my concealer has gone on smoother than ever. I do wish it helped with the appearance of dark circles it but it doesn't claim to do that in the first place any way it's just supposed to hydrate and it does a really good job of that\n",
      "Line3168: I am only 19, so I don’t have very mature skin, but I love using this eye cream at night because it makes it so my concealer doesn’t crease the next morning. I got a sample size in my Sephora play and I feel like I will never run out!\n",
      "Line3169: Love this to deeply moisturize under my eyes since they are so dry. Very effective and smells fresh. Only thing it doesn’t firm the skin, but they offer a eye cream that does that and I want to try that next. Overall wonderful eye cream and works great under concealer as well. Perfect consistency. Also is good for sensitive skin, doesn’t make my eyes burn or anything. Love!\n",
      "Line3170: super gentle and moisturizing. i apply this as the last step of my skincare routine before bed and also before i put on makeup. it helps the undereyes to stay moisturizer and prevents creasing\n",
      "Line3171: This is probably the most moisturizing eye cream I’ve ever used that doesn’t leave a greasy or heavy feeling under my eyes. Once it dries it feels like there’s nothing there. I don’t have any wrinkles under my eyes, but I think this eye cream would probably be helpful for people who do.\n",
      "Line3172: I had gotten a sample of this eye cream in a Sephora play box (which is amazing, by the way). I had never knew using an eye cream was important until recently and now I don’t think I can go without it.\n",
      "Line3173: I love this eye bomb so much! I have really dry skin and this works amazingly underneath my eyes. I adore it so much and it is also great under my foundation. I can definitely see the difference within a week! Worth every penny!\n",
      "Line3174: While I really enjoyed the feeling of this eye cream under my eyes, it didn't really offer the level of moisture I was looking for. I would wake up in the morning and my eyes felt a little dry under my skin. I think I would try this again during the summer months, but for my normal skin, it didn't provide enough moisture during the winter.\n",
      "Line3175: I have been loving this stuff. It hydrates my under eye. I love using it before applying my concealer and it smooth everything out . I just wish it helped with wrinkles.\n",
      "Line3176: Really great moisturizing cream. It feels so coooling under your eyes! If your eyes are sensitive to strong smells then definitely wouldn’t recommend. I didn’t notice much difference with dark circles or hydration under the eyes though.\n",
      "Line3177: This is a great moisturizing eye cream! I love the texture of this - thick and rich. Perfect for your delicate eye area. A little goes a long way so this will last you forever! I love using this as part of my night routine. A great eye cream!\n",
      "Line3178: This is such a nice thick eye cream made for hydration. My under eyes are usually so dry but this has helped them!\n",
      "Line3179: Loved this. I have sensitive skin especially my eye area. Have me the moisture i needed without being too much. I didn't notice any milia.\n",
      "Line3180: Best eye cream ever!  It sinks into the skin and leaves the skin looking plump and feels hydrating all day. Makeup applies over it beautifully. Plus you only need a tiny dab.\n",
      "Line3181: This eye cream is literally the BOMB. For someone who suffers from dry under eyes I really was looking for something that would hydrate even under makeup. This is thin enough to wear under concealer and really keeps my under eye from wrinkling or getting too dry. A little goes along way as well! Love it!\n",
      "Line3182: Nice soothing gel texture but I didn't notice any long term effects. Provided some short term hydration. Probably wouldn't repurchase but it wasn't absolutely useless\n",
      "Line3183: I love this. It’s so moisturizing, and a little goes a long way. I will buy this again.\n",
      "Line3184: Great moisturizing under eye cream. Keeps my under eyes hydrated and helps my concealer go on smoother\n",
      "Line3185: It is alright, kept my undereyes moisturized but I do not feel like it did anything to combat my dark circles or fine lines\n",
      "Line3186: a really unique texture for an eye cream that makes my under eyes feel smooth and plump. i have a sample size and would buy the full size\n",
      "Line3187: Great product. It leaves my under eye more hydrated and I’ve noticed a difference when putting on my makeup. It also doesn’t make me break out. A little goes a long way and I find the product to be worth the price.\n",
      "Line3188: On days that I'm really dry and had a long night of studying or just staying up late, I LOVE to use this eye cream in combination with the Aqua Bomb moisturizer. It leaves my under eyes really hydrated!\n",
      "Line3189: I use the belif eye cream which I also love! It's very hydrating and my under eyes feel so much smoother.\n",
      "Line3190: Very thick. I mostly use it at night or before make up. It gets my skin looking plump and hydrated for the day.\n",
      "Line3191: This cream is fantastic. I got it at Sephora, and it is great for day or night. It’s extremely moisturizing, and is good for the entire eye area. I broke down and purchased this after using 5+ samples because I couldn’t bring myself to spend the money, but it’s worth it. I’m glad I have it.\n",
      "Line3192: I love the texture of this gel. It's so light and smooth. It feels cool and refreshing, and it absorbs quickly.\n",

      "Line3196: This is a pretty basic eye cream. It doesn’t do much for puffiness or dark circles but it does moisturize the under eye. Therefore I like to use this at night. I probably would not buy again.\n",
      "Line3197: The BEST eye cream I have ever used.  I am in my late thirties and noticed some small lines.  I started using this twice a day and I am sold! The lines are pretty much gone and its helps my makeup go on so smoothly.\n",
      "Line3198: I love the way this makes my under eye area look. The only downside is that it makes my eyes burn a little bit.\n",
      "Line3199: I use this every morning under my concealer. I like it but it doesn’t help with the creasing and I feel like it doesn’t absorb as quickly as I hope considering it’s a gel. It is very cooling so it feels really nice on the undereye area.\n",
      "Line3200: I LOVED THIS. It hydrates your eyes and when you wake you in te morning they feel great. it's very gentle when you apply it.\n",
      "Line3201: I got a trial size, but it was definitely enough because you only need a little bit to make your under eyes feel moisturized. I wouldn’t use too much, regardless, because an excess amount can leave your skin feeling a bit thick.\n",
      "Line3202: Loving this product and a little goes a long way. I received this item complimentary for testing purposes. The product is gentle and effective on the skin. I prefer using it at night when since the consistency of the product is somewhat thick.\n",
      "Line3203: The smell was nice. Dont think i would buy this product. I found it heavy and greasy and my eye makeup smudged under my eye due to it the application was smooth and the scent was magnificent, but that wouldn’t be enough to win me over.\n",
      "Line3204: I really like this eye bomb. I use it every night. It’s very refreshing and it really feels lights and smooth. I spread it out over my cheek bones because it feels really hydrating. I do feel like it keeps my under eyes looking refreshed and light!!\n",
      "Line3205: love this eye cream!! very hydrating. i use it before bed and in the morning!! all natural is always good, i love that kbeauty brands never put chemicals in their products\n",
      "Line3206: This is a miracle worker. The texture of this product feels so hydrating but not sticky. I put this on at night after my normal skincare routine and I just get so excited to dip into it. I don’t notice any smell but if there were I wouldn’t mind that. By far one of the best eye creams I have ever used.\n",
      "Line3207: I have never used an eye cream before, but have always heard other people talk about how much they love them and how good they are for aging eyes. I enjoyed using this eye cream. Did not see a ton of difference in my eyes and the skin surrounding them. But I was pleased with how it felt on.\n",

You only need a little bit like it honestly honestly goes a long way. When I put too much I have to basically blend it down my cheeks. It is very light weight. I feel like my under eyes are very soft. I don't have problems with dark circles or bags but with my sleeping schedule, sometimes my eyes are puffier than other days. So I really like this. I feel like it makes me look rested even though tho I wanna pass out or I'm hungover.\n",
      "Line3210: It leaves my under eyes so smooth so when I apply make up it goes on so nice and it feels very hydrating\n",
      "Line3211: I like this eye cream! I was a bit wary at first when I noticed the tiniest burning feeling around my eyes after using this product. It was only the first time and didn’t happen again so not quite sure about that. It is very moisturizing although I didn’t notice any other effects from this. I like to use this at night and the Banana Bright Eye Crème in the mornings!\n",
      "Line3212: My undereyes werent a desert but they were dry enough to mess with concealers. I put this on at night after i wash my face and ten minutes before i put makeup on and it makes such a huge diffrence in my undereyes. I find they've gotten much less dry and more plumped. I highly recommend this\n",
      "Line3213: This eye cream is so bomb.  It is extremely thick but still light weight and I really feel that it makes a difference in how puffy my eyes are the next morning. I am really big into I creams as I have a little tiny bags under my eyes but when I use this they disappear.\n",
      "Line3214: I noticed significant change using this product! I’m a makeup artist and I typically wear a full face of makeup when working with clients on on a shoot. That being said, my under eye area has definitely seen better days. Dark circles , even dryness at times. I used this product before bed and after 1 week I noticed that area more plump & hydrated. Dark circles are still there but that’d be unfair to believe a product can perform magic !\n",
      "Line3215: This is such a great product! I️t is very gentle and soothing for the skin. As soon as I️ use I️t I feel like it’s working. I️ have oily/acne prone skin and this works perfectly with I️t! A brand I trust and would recommend this to anyone!\n",
      "Line3216: Holy grail eye cream!!!!! I cannot say enough good things about this eye cream. It is so creamy and hydrating! My dehydration lines under my eyes started to go away a week after using this! My makeup goes on smooth on top of it and it prevents creasing!! This is my go-to eye creams and the only eye cream I will be using for a long long time! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line3217: Love this eye moisture morning and night.  I have oily lids but I think keeping the area protected is so important.\n",
      "Line3218: I thought this product was great overall, I wish it did a little more for lines/wrinkles, but I felt like it definitely provided moisture which is the intent of the product.\n",
      "Line3219: I lovedthis stuff! I got it as a free trial once and used the entire thing within a month and a half. I like the smell and it works well for all akin types. Leaves a smooth look on your face!\n",

      "Line3222: This!! This eye cream is oh so moisturizing and really leaves your face feeling smooth. It’s not too expensive but at the end of the day totally worth it. I’ve purchased it in a sample and keep buying it. I use the eye bomb and aqua bomb everyday.\n",
      "Line3223: I had a sample size of this and it lasts forever, because the eyes are such a small area on the face. It really does feel nice when it glides on.  It leaves my eyes looking a bit more nourished and young.\n",
      "Line3224: I don’t think I can live without this eye cream! It advertises intense moisture and elasticity. My under eyes often get dry, so I apply this day and night for a boost of moisture! It’s very gentle and great on my sensitive skin. I would recommend this to anyone who needs moisture for their under eye.\n",
      "Line3225: I received this in a Sephora Play box and was eager to try it out because i normally love Belif’s moisturizers. This one, however, seemed to dry my eye area out after the second or third use. I kept using it in hopes to fix it but instead it kept getting worse. I do not like this product and i do not recommend it.\n",
      "Line3226: Feels great around eyes. It’s super moisturizing and you get a ton of product in the jar. I don’t think I’ll ever run out of product anytime soon. You can also use it on any areas of your face with fine lines to plump them up.\n",
      "Line3227: I’ve been using this for a few months now, and There’s still a lot of product. I’ve never seen an eye cream this big (MEGA PLUS). It really hydrates the under eyes with a gel like texture that’s not too thin and not too thick. 😉\n",
      "Line3228: This has helped my under eyes immensely! My skin looks so great with these belif products! I got mine at Sephora in a little travel set and I’m going to buy the full size ones ASAP! Definitely recommend.\n",
      "Line3229: I have just started using this product and I can already see the difference in my under eye and how my makeup applies so much smoother now. This is super easy to apply and you don’t even need to put a lot on the face! Aka, more product for you! 💖\n",
      "Line3230: I use this every morning when I wake up as a morning and daytime moisturizer. It is one of my favorites. I find it very hydrating and absorbs into my skin fast, plus it doesn’t leave a “film” on my skin or leave it feeling greasy. I also find that when I don’t use it and apply makeup on my under eyes, you can definitely tell the difference.\n",
      "Line3231: I have very oily skin, with the exception of my under eyes, which are very dry. Especially after abusing my under eyes with shape tape for so long! The skin was patchy, dry, and irritated, but this saved them! My under eyes were so moisturized and this product wears wonderfully under makeup. It is a lifesaver and a must-try!\n",
      "Line3232: Love this product! Got this to test out and I’m in love! Very moisturizing and thin! Totally recommend this!\n",

      "Line3235: Refreshing burst of cool. Awakens, plumps and hydrates the under eye skin. A nice little spa moment for the under eyes. They do deserve it. Ingredients are good. Not sure if its a lasting or forever \"fix\" but it does provide an intense instant fix\n",
      "Line3236: This eye cream is the only one I can use without getting those pesky white bumps. It sinks into the skin a little slowly but I actually enjoy that because the eye cream has a little cooling effect (or at least for me) that seems to help refresh my under eye\n",
      "Line3237: This is perfect for helping the under eye brighten up and look and feel moisturized. I tend to get dry patches around my eyes and I love using this to help relieve the dryness! I highly recommend this to any one, but especially people with dry skin!\n",
      "Line3238: Lately when I’m without makeup,  I’ve been using my belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb my skin is moisturized and seems less puffy.  I enjoy that. It doesn’t leave me with that heavy sticky oily feeling like some others do. (I dislike moisturizers for that reason) this works really well!   I would enjoy this as a #SephoraInsider point Redemption website. Heck i would even buy it if i could afford to!\n",
      "Line3239: This feels nice and I absolutely adore the colors and packaging but, I doubt I’ll buy more once this jar runs out. I don’t notice much improvement. Maybe it’s actually working? I just can’t tell at all.\n",
      "Line3240: First time using it and I love how moisturized my eyes are after applying, It really last for a day. It’s in my daily regime right now!\n",
      "Line3241: This is a weightless eye moisturizer that feels so refreshing to put over my eye area. I love using this gel/cream formula right after washing my face to add immediate moisture to my eyes. I bought this from Sephora and have not been disappointed. I recommend this to all skin types. I have never been happier with an eye cream/gel. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line3242: It feels really moisturizing when you put it on but I felt like over time it had the opposite effect.\n",
      "Line3243: Best product if your skin is dry. It helps plump upy skin and made the dryness go away. Definitely recommend.\n",
      "Line3244: Absolutely amazing! Not only does it leave my eyes feeling fresh and hydrated, it helps my under-eye makeup not crease. I use it twice a day and this has lasted me about six months (mind you, I also used a good amount for my face when I ran out of lotion).\n",
      "Line3245: I love this eye cream. It’s my current favorite. It’s so gentle and hydrating. This never stings my eyes, even if they’re irritated. It’s moisturizing without feeling heavy or greasy. It doesn’t clog my pores or give me breakouts. The only downside is that it doesn’t do much anti-aging, but that’s fine if you don’t expect it to (and probably is part of why it’s so gentle). If I want more anti-aging, I’ll layer a serum under this cream.\n",
      "Line3246: I apply this right before bed and it is sooo soothing! It’s so creamy and soft. I love the packaging, it’s so sleek and hold product well. The gentle formula is great for my sensitive skin. It’s PERFECT ❤️\n",
      "Line3247: I'm a big fan of belif's products. I purchased the Aqua Bomb gift set from Sephora. It is a great amount of products for the price. I've used them for months now and I've been very impressed. They are moisturizing and make my skin feel dewy and like a baby's. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Line3248: I really love this! It leaves my under eye area so moisturized, and isn’t too heavy. It also doesn’t have too strong of a scent. I would definitely recommend!\n",
      "Line3249: I use this product every night before bed, and it’s super hydrating. Not sure I’ve seen much of a difference in under eye lines or anything but it leaves my eye area feeling very hydrated. Would buy again.\n",
      "Line3250: I loved this product so much! I often have very dry skin around my eyes so this really helped give me the hydration I needed!\n",
      "Line3251: Best hydration for under your eyes great for anyone all skin type can use it. Use day & night\n",
      "Line3252: I like the way this feels on my eyes. It’s not too thick or watery. I feel like my eyes absorb the product well. The only thing I would say about this is that I think it’s more a quick fix rather than long term. I have noticed long term results, but it does make puffiness go away instantly.\n",
      "Line3253: It worked pretty well. It def leaves my under eye hydrated and plumped up! I would use again.\n",
      "Line3254: Accidentally purchased at Sephora, instead of the peat one. Highly enjoy, leaves eye area feeling smooth and refreshed. On the thicker/heavier side. Prefer the peat one but would still recommend to those who are looking for a thick eye cream.\n",
      "Line3255: Obsessed with this eye cream! It’s a staple in my nightly routine. Nothing works better! Couldn’t be more impressed with the results. It’s a little pricey, but if you’re looking for a high quality eye cream that won’t break you out, I would highly recommend!\n",

      "Line3260: This product is amazing.   I have always had dark circles and very dry skin under my eyes.  I noticed that the skin under my eyes retained the moisture and my dark circles diminished.\n",
      "Line3261: This is very hydrating and cooling on my eyes.  I use it as an extra layer on top of my night eye cream each night.  I usually wash my face a few hours before I go to sleep, and I use this just before going to sleep on my eyes.  I'm working to hydrate my eyes to reduce wrinkles, and adding this step has helped.  My eyes look so much more alive.  My dark circles have been minimized.  I look like I got a better nights sleep even though my sleep habits have always been good, eyes never used to show it.  I love it and will continue to use it.\n",
      "Line3262: I love the smell of this cream. Now I personally don’t have dry skin, BUT this dream is for under the eye. I get bags, dark circles, and puffiness under my eye so that’s where this product comes in. Every night before bed I use under my eye and in the morning before work I use it with another under eye serum I haves. This cream definitely keeps my under eye area hydrated ! It looks moisturized, like you can tell. I think it’s a great product and I’ll definitely continue using it.\n",
      "Line3263: This is product is better then anything else I’ve ever tried. It smells great and leaves my under eye feeling soft. It’s helped with the elasticity around my eye area. It’s a little pricey but with the money and a little goes a long way!\n",
      "Line3264: it does what is says, which is to moisturize, but that’s pretty much it. if you’re looking for something that’ll help with puffiness or darkness, it’d be best to look elsewhere.\n",
      "Line3265: This is a really great eye cream that I use in the morning and at night. It has really helped the lines around my eyes soften. I can always tell the nights I skip it because I look so tired the next day.\n",
      "Line3266: I love this stuff. I picked this up at Sephora while looking at eye creams. I’ve been using it for a few months now and I really like it. My under eyes are more hydrated and my makeup looks so much better. I would recommend this.\n",
      "Line3267: I got a sample of this in a Sephora box and I LOVE IT. My under eyes tend to get dry and this  is my favorite under eye product I’ve tried. I will definitely be purchasing a full size soon. Highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Line3268: It is so refreshing on the eyes and nourishes the skin. It is lightweight and smells good. I used it night and day because it went perfectly under my make up as well. I would definitely recommend this to others and repurchase myself as well.\n",

      "Line3270: I just received a sample of this eye cream and I am really enjoying it. I dab on a small amount and it penetrates my skin quickly leaving a well hydrated eye area. No stinging or watering of my eyes with this product. I’m going to purchase a full size very soon.\n",
      "Line3271: This eye treatment is so moisturizing and really makes your eyes feel hydrated all day long! A bit pricy so only reason I’d mark it down! But trust me when i say a little goes a long way\n",
      "Line3272: Super moisturizing but it doesn’t do a whole lot for my undereye bags. Wish it took away the redness and puffiness. I ended up using this as a moisturizer before I put on foundation. Super pricey.\n",
      "Line3273: My favorite lately. My under eyes get really dry and irritated since I have allergies and wear contacts. This helps them stay hydrated without feeling like it’s too heavy of a cream.\n",
      "Line3274: I always recommend this eye cream. Super hydrating and works wonderful under makeup. Very hydrating and smoothing\n",
      "Line3275: This cream is great for moisturizing and the consistency is great, not too thick and easily absorbed. However, besides moisture I didn't find any other benefits for my personal needs. This would be a great eye cream for a younger person to keep moisture. I'm 41 with dark circles (naturally). I will keep using this during dryer times of the year.\n",
      "Line3276: Oh my god this eye cream is good!  I got a sample at their booth at IMATS where I bought their overnight mask and sheet mask.  I have two high end eye creams currently and didn’t think it could possibly be better and it is!  I’m totally buying!!\n",

      "Line3280: My eyes are very sensitive and it doesn’t take a lot to make them react/burn when trying different products, however they don’t with this! this cream is so intensely hydrating, I use a generous amount at night and a small amount under makeup and it doesn’t effect how my makeup lasts in that area, highly recommend!!!\n",
      "Line3281: I have very sensitive skin and this did not irritate it. This is super hydrating, great to use in the morning and at night. It sinks in quickly and does not disrupt my undereye concealer. Would definitely recommend!\n",
      "Line3282: I’m new to the eye cream game. I’m a believer in using great skincare so I didn’t think I needed an eye cream. Eye creams I’ve tried in the past never made much of a difference so I just stopped using it altogether. Recently I’ve noticed my under eye area was getting dry especially when using concealer. I decided to give it another shot. Luckily I received the Belif eye cream in a Sephora play box and decided to try it since I enjoy other products from this brand. I really like this cream. It’s cooling, light yet moisturizing, and doesn’t interfere with makeup application. It’s a thumbs up for me.\n",
      "Line3283: Belif is an also excellent brand. I love the aqua moisture bomb, because it moisturizes my skin without it feeling greasy.  This eye cream is moisturizing but nothing special. When this is over, i will try another brand. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",

      "Line3285: I didn’t love the eye cream, so gave it to my mom to try. She is a huge fan and says it has reduced her puffiness. My skin is super fragile, so would recommend taking that into account.\n",
      "Line3286: So hydrating! And didn’t break my sensitive skin out. Got it in my Sephora play box and loved it!\n",
      "Line3287: I got this as a sample size in my last Sephora Play! Subscription box and I was really excited because Ive been wanting to use this for awhile now after reading so many great reviews. After using it, I can say i much prefer this in the morning bc its a light gel that sinks into the skin and wears well under makeup. Its great for that. But I prefer a heavier, thicker consistency eye cream at night for maximum hydration\n",
      "Line3288: The most amazing eye moisturizer ive tried in a while. Extra hudrating plus could double as a makeup eye primer. Recommended.\n",
      "Line3289: I received a sample size of this through Sephora play and it is absolutely amazing. It’s very gentle, safe for sensitive skin and super hydrating. I have very dry under eyes and I use this every morning and the Mario Badescu Olive Eye Cream at night. This combo has turned my under eye area around and has made a huge impact. A little goes a long way with this as well. I can’t wait to buy the full size.\n",
      "Line3290: This product is beautiful. You get such a large amount for the price you pay and you need so LITTLE. I picked this up at Sephora unsure of what kind of results I would see, and what I've gotten are bright, hydrated eyes. I use this with an eye mask at night and look 5 years younger in the morning. This brand has impressed me and I'm excited to keep trying their products.\n",
      "Line3291: Very cool gel consistency that is unique and unlike any other product! It’s not as brightening as I’d like it to be but provides adequate moisture\n",
      "Line3292: This is the first eye cream that doesn’t make my eyes water. It keeps my under eyes nice and hydrated and soft. It doesn’t help my dark circles or puffiness but it is very hydrating. Definitely worth the money and a little goes a long way\n",
      "Line3293: This product is ok in my opinion, it does what's its made to do, but it's nothing special really. It moisturizes  it's good if you get really dry under your eye.\n",
      "Line3294: There's really nothing to say about this product besides IT WORKS! It feels amazing on your skin, it isn't too heavy but does have a nice rich feel to it. I use it at night and always wake up with my under-eye area looking happier and healthier.\n",
      "Line3295: I love this eye cream because of how hydrating I.T is. I have kind of dry under eyes and this really gave me the moisture I need.\n",
      "Line3296: I can’t say I see a massive difference but I use this to moisturize my under eyes before I do my make up. It does keep skin under my eyes pretty moisturized and doesn’t disrupt my concealer.\n",
      "Line3297: This is my favorite product for hydrating my eyes while I sleep. It is the biggest sample size I've ever gotten and I am not biased based on that. But, I feel that after washing my face at night this helps put moisture back and a little does go a long way! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line3298: AMAZING! I got this from Sephora and am OBSESSED. I have darker under-eyes and some fine lines developing. The moisture from this product is incredible and the cooling effect is really nice. I will be purchasing as soon as I run out because the results were a lighter under-eye area and less noticeable fine lines.\n",
      "Line3299: Holy grail eye cream! Makes my undereyes so moisturized and less puffy. Also helps my dark circles a ton.\n",
      "Line3300: Sooo amazing. I'd use it right before i put on under eye concealer and it would make it last so much longer. It got rid of under eye circles and made me look more awake. It's pricey but so worth it.\n",
      "Line3301: I have really dry skin so I started using this under my eyes and on the sides of my eyes at night before bed. I wake up with hydrated and supple skin under my eyes! It doesn't really have a scent but has a nice texture, not greasy. I'd probably buy it again.\n",
      "Line3302: First thing I’ve noticed in this cream is its gel consistency. It’s very lightweight to your skin but effective for providing moisture to your eye area. It has a scent but it’s really hard to describe. It’s gentle and effective!\n",
      "Line3303: I really love this eye cream! It feels very rich and moisturizing. It’s also super affordable and I love their concept. I got a tester of this cream and used it all up so fast! Going to buy a regular size this week. Great quality!\n",
      "Line3304: I think this is an amazing eye cream for day or night. It is hydrating but incredibly light, so it's perfect for under makeup or as part of your evening skincare routine. My undereye area feels plump once applied, and I haven't had any irritation.\n",

It sits so well under makeup and doesn’t leave you looking or feeling greasy! My under eyes are extremely dry and this does wonders!\n",
      "Line3307: Nice light weight and extremely hydrating. When my skin needs some tlc I use it sliver my face at times\n",
      "Line3308: This felt amazing under the eyes. I loved it but unfortunately I think the skin under my eyes is too sensitive and this broke me out.\n",
      "Line3309: The belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is one of the best eye creams at this price point. My makeup goes on easily and stays on all day if I use it in the morning. It’s also great to use at night for all-night moisturizing. I also love the ingredient list-NO parabens or sulfates! I received this product for free from Influenster, but my opinions are my own, and I hands down recommend this product and will purchase on my own.\n",
      "Line3310: This makes the eye area look smooth and hydrated. It feels.good and not greasy. It's a must have skin care routine. Try it and buy it. It is that good.\n",
      "Line3311: Really hydrating and fresh smelling, it has a gel like texture and super moisturizing. Good for under concealer so it doesn't look dry and patchy especially.\n",
      "Line3312: This is a great eye cream! It’s very hydrating and smooths and depuffs nicely. I did not notice a noticeable improvement in my dark circles though. It looks very nice under makeup and I will continue to use it!\n",
      "Line3313: I got a sample of this in a beauty subscription bag. It is light blue in color, and has the consistency of a moisturizer. It has a slight cooling effect, and tingled a little when applied (not too much though). I noticed a small difference in the puffiness under my eyes, but this did nothing for the dark circles. It cured the dryness under my eyes though. Overall it was semi-effective for me. I'm not sure the price point is worth it for me.\n",
      "Line3314: I got this a couple weeks ago and it’s my first eye cream ever! It smells so good and doesn’t irritate my skin and soaks into my skin so well. I love the way it’s absorbed and it’s so refreshing too! Will definitely repurchase\n",
      "Line3315: Really nice, deeply moisturizing (but gentle) product. I’ve found that it’s great for nighttime use and really helps my undereye bags. A bit greasy for daytime wear under makeup (which is expected for a product like this) but so far I really like it!\n",
      "Line3316: I got a sample of this in a Sephora play box and I’ve been using it for about a week. I’m noticing immediate differences from my last eye cream. It’s got a nice thick gel texture. If you have by kind of dryness under your eyes this will take care of it right away! It also works beautifully under make up. A little goes a long way!\n",
      "Line3317: #1 in Eye Cream's, it deserves that title! I recently ran into Belief products, and I am so happy that I did. The value of it is great. I read & watched so many reviews, then I tried it! I got mine at Sephora, and I would recommend this to others! I live in a dry dry state so this was def a must have this winter. I can't wait to see how it holds up this summer! I will be buying this again, if you are on the fence, go to your local Sephora (or anywhere else that sells this and gives you free samples) and try some, if you are on the fence.\n",
      "Line3318: This eye cream is super moisturizing and makes your under eyes really plump and glowy!\n",
      "Line3319: My most favorite eye cream of all! I received it in one of Sephora Play Boxes and immediately put it into use. It’s very light and moisturizes my eye area very well. I truly love how it feels on my skin. Once I’m done with my deluxe sample, I’m definitely buying a full-sized one!\n",
      "Line3320: This wonderful little guy is so hydrating and lightweight under my eyes, I love its water gel consistency similar to Neutrogena Hydro Boost moisturizer. It’s not as heavy as Kiehl’s creamy eye treatment either so that’s a plus as well!\n",
      "Line3321: I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY THIS TILL THE END OF TIME!!!!! The only eye cream I have ever used where I 100% notice a difference. Not only does it immediately hydrate so nicely, but it also plumps up my under eye. I use this morning and night and cannot get over how much it’s helping me!\n",
      "Line3322: The most moisturizing balm. Not all skincare suits everyone’s skin texture but this worked fine on me. Never too greasy and was moisturizing. Loved how my skin felt after using them\n",
      "Line3323: Very hydrating cream and not too greasy. I just didn't see anything particularly different about this eye cream but I did like it! I need to keep trying it.\n",
      "Line3324: I received this as a sample in a sephora play box and I really like it. It is really moisturizing under my eyes. I only use it at night because it does feel a little thick, but it does a great job. Will buy again.\n",
      "Line3325: I love this product. I was weary about eye creams and kinda in denial about needed them but I truly notice a different with this product. It is definitely worth checking out! Belif products are underrated and really awesome.\n",
      "Line3326: I ran out of this product but it does really does help my dry under eyes become more moisturized. Good for underneath makeup as well.\n",
      "Line3327: This is my favorite product I’ve tried from this company! I use it every morning and a little goes a long way. It’s super moisturizing and I feel like my under eye make up stays on better after using!\n",
      "Line3328: This eye bomb is magnificent! I got it in a VoxBox and before using it I had major eye bags and since using it they aren’t as noticeable which I love. The packaging is simple but cute and sturdy, I love that it seems like a small jar but it last forever since you don’t need a lot of product!\n",
      "Line3329: I got a sample of this in my monthly Sephora playbox and love it so far. While it isn’t some magical eye cream that will rid you of all wrinkles, it is a nice layer of hydration for your sensitive eye area. It doesn’t irritate my eyes at all and works very well under make up!\n",
      "Line3330: This stuff felt nice and cool under my eyes. It’s not as effective but just nice to keep under eyes moisturized. It’s pretty pricey for something that just hydrates so maybe stick to a moisturizer instead but if you want to blow money hey this is your product.\n",
      "Line3331: Love this for when my under eye area is dry. It really sinks in and moisturizes. It also helps with my makeup application and prevents too much creasing with my foundation.\n",
      "Line3332: yes, it's expensive but worth it. I have pretty dry skin and this smooths my under-eyes out like no other cream. It's also pretty lightweight, it sinks in quickly and just leaves this nice softness. Can't say it does much for pigmentation/wrinkles yet but it's definitely moisturizing so I will continue using it!\n",
      "Line3333: 5 star product!!! This eye cream is the most moisturizing cream I’ve ever used. Water bomb is the perfect name for this cream because it relieves dry under eyes like no other. I love the gel like texture it has as well. Great for pre makeup application, just make sure to give it time to dry down!\n",
      "Line3334: This is my favorite eye cream! It’s so moisturizing but doesn’t leave my under eyes looking greasy. I feel like my skin immediately absorbs it and my under eyes would be left moisturized the whole day. It’s lightweight that it doesn’t affect my makeup when I do put makeup on top. Would totally recommend\n",
      "Line3335: This is by far the best eye cream that I have ever tried. It’s so moisturizing without being to heavy! It’s so easy to use and doesn’t pull on your sensitive eyelids and under eye area. I use this daily! Love love love!\n",
      "Line3336: Yet another wonderful eye balm that works. I suggest using it before bed. Kind of pricey but if you’re willing to spend a little extra it isn’t that bad. Available at Sephora\n",
      "Line3337: I received this product via Influenster and Benefit Voxbox and fell completely in love! This is the perfect serum for under your eyes to give you that dewy glow. I’ve been using for a month now and can tell such a difference, I will definitely be buying more this product!\n",
      "Line3338: Keeps eyes refreshed and moisturized!  I use this every morning and evening and what a eye cream this is 😊\n",
      "Line3339: If your skin really wants a quench, add this to your skincare routine! I was looking for something to hydrate and plump my under eyes and this product does the trick. I have issues with darkness because ive gone without properly moisturizing my under eyes for so long, but since using this product I can really see a difference. Pat on instead of rubbing in and also store this in the refrigerator for an instant depuffing agent!\n",
      "Line3340: This eye cream is amazing! It has a lightweight feel that feels like water when being blended out on the skin and it’s great to wear under make up or in hot weather as you don’t feel a thick layer melting on your skin! It is not oily at all and it has worked so well on lessening the appearance of my fine lines!\n",
      "Line3341: I like this product, but i put 4 stars because i would like to feel more hydration in my under eye area, but its a pretty good product. I have a sample of this product.\n",
      "Line3342: I usually use this underneath another eye cream, but this is such a light yet effective product. I just started using this product a couple months ago from Ipsy gen beauty and I already love it. I definitely thing I would purchase it again. The main up side to this is that it feels like nothing is on your skin so you can add additional product without your face feeling too heavy.\n",
      "Line3343: Great gel cream for my eye area. Lightweight gel formula, smells and feels refreshing and cool, leaves the skin around my eyes feeling energized and supple.\n",
      "Line3344: I have sensitive eyes and this doesn't irritate them.  It looks like its working. It doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything. I would recommend this.\n",
      "Line3345: i’m a big fan of belif products, it feels lightweight on my skin and leaves my eyes looks refreshed and the skin smooth and firm. i’ve given this 4/5 as i don’t feel it’s as effective as my other eye cream but it is still a great product. smells good too!\n",
      "Line3346: This product is so good!! Keeps my under eyes super moisturized! I’ve purchased this a few times from Ulta! Total life saver! Would definitely recommend this to anyone with under dry under eyes! Not the most impressive packaging, but worth every dollar in my book!\n",
      "Line3347: This under eye cream is really nice and has a very creamy formula and works for it's purpose. However, it is quite expensive and I feel as if there are other less expensive options to choose from. It is very hydrating but again there are less expensive eye creams out there.\n",
      "Line3348: Got this in the March Sephora playbox, and I’m in love with it. It keeps the skin around my eyes moisturizes and peppy, and makes me curious about trying the belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb to see if that is just as amazing for my face.\n",
      "Line3349: This eye bomb is not for brightening or for waking up the under eye, but for giving it that extra moisture! I have a somewhat dry under eye and sometimes my concealer looks a little dry and this really helps! A little goes a very long way with this stuff too which is awesome! This is my first product with this brand and I am impressed! I believe I will purchase again! These are my own opinions given to me by my personal experience with the product!\n",
      "Line3350: I use this product every night. The texture is great, it’s not greasy or oily! And it really moisturizes well.\n",
      "Line3351: Omg LOVE!!!!! I can’t say enough good about this product. I use it in the morning after washing my face and before applying makeup. It has a cooling effect that makes your eyes feel more awake. It isn’t to thick or thin. It glides on easily with zero tugging at the eyes but it isn’t greasy at all. It soaks into the skin and leaves your eye skin perfectly ready for makeup. It is wonderful!!!\n",
      "Line3352: I love belif products! I’ve tried this one and the moisturizing bomb! So hydrating to the face! I can’t get enough of the brand! I would recommend this to EVERYONE!\n",
      "Line3353: I really wanted to like this product after swatching it on my wrist. It's very rich and moisturizing and seems like it'll do a great job and erasing those pesky crows feet. BUT, I have extremely sensitive eyes and most eye creams irritate my eyes causing them to water throughout the day. This product was no exception which is a shame because I think I really could've liked it.\n",
      "Line3354: Lets start by saying ...WOW!!!!! BOMBS AWAY! I have recently lost over 50lbs and the skin on my face is obviously less supple. I seriously started to see the wrinkles attack my face instantly. So I went to war!!! I bought the \"BOMB\". I loved how it instantly sinks right into my skin and goes to work. I can apply makeup with in a couple of minutes and the best part is there is no sticky residue.  I use this twice a day and within a couple of days I started to see a big difference. A coworker even told me that I looked more awake. The lines have started to lessen. HOOORAYY!!!!!I am now passed the sample stage and have purchased a full sized bottle. I cant imagine using anything else on my eyes. I may actually be ready to become a full blown Belif user. Product is not cheap but not terribly expensive. I just wish I had a before and after photo.\n",
      "Line3355: I have been seeing subtle improvements in my dark circles and the product helps with improving the firmness of my undereyes. I love that it doesn’t have a strong scent and quickly absorbs, so no residue!\n",
      "Line3356: Beware if you have very sensitive skin. Something in this irritates my skin. It made me puffy and red. It does smell good and is probably great if you aren’t sensitive. It’s also pretty expensive compared to other mid range brands.\n",
      "Line3357: The only thing I dislike about this product is the price, other than that I have found my holy grail eye cream. I am not allowed to use heavy emollient eye creams because I will get milia under my eyes. I have to use gel based eye creams if I dont want milia to reappear and this works soooo good. Its moisturizing, does not sting the eyes, soothing, helps concealer not look cakey. A little goes a long way. It smells like herbs to me which I enjoy, I feel like I am at a spa when I put this on.\n",
      "Line3358: Keeping your eyes hydrated is key to fight aging and this product does that fast drying put on day and night for amazingly hydrated awake eyes to keep the fight on Aging\n",
      "Line3359: This eye cream is so refreshing, especially after a long flight. I have extremely dry under eyes and I feel as though this brings me back to life. It’s extremely cooling, gentle and does everything you want an eye cream to do and more. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Line3360: The best skin care brand out there! This make my under eyes look flawless. Worth every penny!\n",
      "Line3361: This eye cream is so good. It is such a good cream/moisturizer I use it for my whole face lol. My mom got it and I stole it but I’ll definitely be buying another one when I run out. I 100% recommend. It’s my favorite!\n",
      "Line3362: The best product I’ve ever received from influenster. It makes my under eye feel so smooth, perfect and hydrated. I’m obsessed and will for sure buy again.\n",
      "Line3363: I really enjoyed this belif product for moisturizing under my eyes. It doesn't settle into my fine lines and when I apply it at night, I wake up with a well hydrated eye area! The nice thing about this cream is that is isn't heavy and feels light when applying it. Overall one of the better eye creams on the market, especially given its price!\n",
      "Line3364: Absorbs super quick. light and does not look greasy or oily after applying. effective for people having dry skin under eyes.\n",
      "Line3365: Got a sample of this in my Sephora box and love it! It smells great and works really fast and well!\n",
      "Line3366: I received this as a sample in my Sephora play box and I was so impressed on how moisturized my eyes felt! It didn’t feel greasy or sink into my laugh lines. I sometimes put it on my dry patches on other parts of my face. I was blown away on how great this moisturizer worked and I’ll definitely be purchasing the full size!!\n",
      "Line3367: This eye cream is silky and smooth. I’m not sure how much it really worked but it made me feel like I was doing something right. Make sure to wait until it’s dry before applying makeup or you will see creasing under your eye.\n",
      "Line3368: Pretty solid eye cream. I use it before applying make up and it is super hydrating and absorbs well. Doesn't pill. I don't see any difference in wrinkles or puffiness but it's a nice extra layer for moisturizing your eye area. Would purchase again.\n",
      "Line3369: This eye cream is great. It’s very light and moisturizing! My eyelids get very dry and this really helps them! I would definitely recommend this.\n",
      "Line3370: I have a very.... VERY dry eye area. This was already a problem, before products that irritated it more, then Chicago winters. This product doesn't really get rid of my fine lines (but to be fair I have yet to find any products that really do.... I rubbed my eyes a lot very vigorously as a kid).That all being said, it is WONDERFUL at moisturizing. Within two nights of using it, my eyes went from being flaky and itchy and in pain to comfortable. Two weeks more and they actually became supple. Supple! It says moisturizing bomb and it MEANS it!I'm giving it 4 stars because I simply don't see it repairing fine lines or helping elasticity. If it weren't making those claims it would instantly be 5 stars from me because it's an absolute miracle worker for severe dryness!\n",
      "Line3371: Got this in my Sephora PLAY and I love it! It's very hydrating and help with those really dry says when I have flaky skin. I do have to layer it on those really dry days but it does the job\n",
      "Line3372: A very lightweight, ultra-absorbent eye cream that has made a visible difference in reducing and preventing under eye circles. It has a nice cooling effect and I can feel after-effects if it working for hours after I put it on. This product is the bomb, indeed!\n",
      "Line3373: A hidden gem. Helps moisturize The delicate eye area. Light yet provides moisture to boost elasticity. Good as a primer. Good packaging. Natural ingredients\n",
      "Line3374: This is my new absolute favorite eye cream! I use this when I wake up in the morning for under my eyes to prevent premature aging and kind of hide my dark circles. I don’t know if it is just a coincidence, but my eyes have never looked more bright and refreshed (even when I don’t get a TON of sleep). I have noticed they aren’t as dry as they were before as well.\n",
      "Line3375: When I first tried this, I didn’t like it. I honestly left it in my drawers for awhile. Then one day, I woke up and had these extremely dry patches of skin around my eyes that felt extremely tight. It was the most uncomfortable feeling, so I wanted to find something that was really going to moisturize that area. I pulled this bad boy back out and it really saved me! The skin around my eyes felt so hydrated and now I use it every morning! It doesn’t really do anything else for me but because my eyes are so dry, I have to use this very often.\n",
      "Line3376: Got this complimentary from Influenster, I love this eye bomb, I love how creamy it is. I feel when I use this before my makeup routine my eyes do feel a bit more moisturized through the day.\n",
      "Line3377: This is the best eye cream that I’ve used so far. It’s thick, very moisturizing and i feel my ender eye very soft when i wake up next day. Bought it from sephora after using other day cream from the brand.\n",
      "Line3378: I wasn't a big fan of this product. While it felt okay on my face it made my eyes very itchy. But I'm usually not very dry under my eyes so not sure if that had something to do with it. I received this product for testing purposes complimentary from Influenster.\n",
      "Line3379: Great eye cream! Was extremely hydrating amd didn't cause breakouts. I used it in my entire face during winter months in the desert.\n",
      "Line3380: Absolutely the best eye cream in the market. A little goes a long way and this can last you for at least three months. The product is super moisturizing and it is totally worth the price.\n",
      "Line3381: Love the belif brand. I got a sample of the moisturizing eye cream in my Sephora play box and just started using it. When first applied it feels cool. It has just the right amount of moisture. Not to think not to thin. I apply mine at night before bed. The smell is not bothersome to me. It’s kinda citrusy. I will purchase a full size soon. And would recommend to family and friends.\n",
      "Line3382: My FAVORITE eye cream ever. It’s initially too thick for my personal liking but it really gets deep into my skin and gives it amazing moisture. I have bags, dark circles & veins & it reduces all of that. It’s great under makeup as it’s not greasy or thick.\n",
      "Line3383: I use this product every single day! The consistency of the lotion is so thick, and feels great going on! Absolutely love it.\n",
      "Line3384: Love using this so that my under eyes dont crease throughout the day. Love this product for that reason. Five stars.\n",
      "Line3385: I love using this moisturizing eye bomb as a base before applying my makeup. Concealer and color corrector glides on super smooth on top of this and somehow it helps with creasing too. I also like how light it feels.\n",
      "Line3386: I received this in my Sephora's play box and I couldn't be happier. I've always wanted to try Belif skincare. The name says it all, the cream is very lightweight and hydrating. 5 stars!\n",
      "Line3387: It certainly is moisturizing like its name states. No scent and doesn’t irritate my eye area which is great! The price tag is a little steep in my opinion but I got it as a gift so I learn to really cherish It\n",
      "Line3388: Feels cooling and nice, not sticky or greasy. I received a sample of it in my Sephora box.. not sure if I’m going to purchase it yet.\n",
      "Line3389: Excelent product! This eye cream is very moisturizing and smells really fresh! I have over a month using it and my under eyes looks so well!\n",
      "Line3390: I have very dry skin, especially under my eyes. With regular moisturizers, my dry under-eye area only becomes visible if I set under my eyes with powder, but when I used this bomb, that went away entirely. Days when I wasnt wearing makeup, it made my eyes look less tired! This product will definitely become a regular part of my routine.\n",
      "Line3391: Really great for sensitive eyes, I never feel a burning sensation on the thin skin around my eyes like I have with other creams. I’m still not sure if I’ve seen results with it yet, but I’m happy to keep using.\n",
      "Line3392: This has becoming my every night eye cream. It feels very light but works heavy duty. I don't like using it before applying makeup though, I have issues with it balling up if I try to blend anything over the cream. IMO it is best used by itself\n",
      "Line3393: PERFECT! I used to never use eye creams but I can’t go a day without using this before applying makeup. It just brightens the area overall and makes me feel more awake\n",
      "Line3394: This product is so soft with my eye skin, the consistency is so easy to apply and you just need a little bit.\n",
      "Line3395: A great lightweight eye cream for every day use. This is perfect for every day wear due to how light it sits on my face. Not greasy or heavy at all! Most eye creams are too heavy and cause millia, this one sits fabulously and is great.\n",
      "Line3396: I needed an eye cream because of my dry under eyes causing tarte shape tape to crease and look heavy. This is a great choice because it is light but very gel like almost. It does a great job but there are no anti aging benefits to it\n",
      "Line3397: I usually don’t use things like this. I liked it I thought it was nice and hydrating. I got this item free for testing purposes. I want to use it longer to see results but so far so good ! I would recommend to a friend.\n",
      "Line3398: I'm obsessed! I love how rich and creamy this product is. It's super effective and you only need a little amount! Incredibly moisturizing and always makes me feel de-puffed and ready for the day. Will absolutely buy again.\n",
      "Line3399: This is my new favorite nighttime eye cream. It’s heavy enough to moisturize but light enough to keep the milia away. I use a spatula to get the product out of the jar but wish this came in a tube. It’s lightweight enough for that and would be much cleaner.\n",
      "Line3400: I liked this product.it came with sephora play box. I used everynight before sleeping.when i wake up my under eye is so smooth.but price is little bit expensive\n",
      "Line3401: I love the thickness of the product and it does moisturize under my eyes. It doesn't do much for the discoloration which is what I'm looking for\n",
      "Line3402: Love how hydrating this eye cream is! It instantly refreshes my tired eyes and makes me look more awake. I love using it before I apply my makeup, my concealer glides on more smoothly. I haven’t seen a big difference on improving my dark circles but definitely improves dryness.\n",
      "Line3403: I love this eye cream. It is so nice and does help moisturize my under eye area. It does help reduce fine lines and smooths the skin. It applies nicely and absorbs quickly into the skin. I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Line3404: to accurately rate this eye cream, I have to be clear on what I look for in an eye cream. personally, I like an eye cream to reduce swelling & moisturize. although I have to admit I haven’t seen a change in my under eyes swelling, I don’t think it’s possible for a product to moisturize my under eyes more than this does. I apply it in the morning, & when I wash my face at night I can still feel the product on my eyes. if you’re looking for a moisturizer for your under eyes, look no further!\n",
      "Line3405: Super moisturizing. Thick. A little goes a long way. Thanks Sephora. I’ve been using it every night.\n",
      "Line3406: This feels so nice on the under eye. It's light weight so it sinks in quickly and doesn't leave any sort of residue, but it's ultra hydrating and plumping! My concealer started looking better and less cakey after I started using this in the mornings.\n",
      "Line3407: Perfect texture gel sort of creamy, light texture doesn't feel greasy but glides on easily love putting this on\n",
      "Line3408: I got a small sample of this from Sephora, and it seems OK. It's moisturizing, which is my main concern for my undereye area, but I haven't noticed any other differences in my skin, like the elasticity, which it claims to improve. I still need to apply this often, though it claims to moisturize for 26 hours, the skin under my eyes requires more moisture the next morning so I have to reapply. I'm not wow-ed by it, but I am glad I have the sample and will continue to use it until it's gone. I'm still in search of an eye cream that really blows my mind, and I was hoping this would be the one. It's good, but not holy grail.\n",
      "Line3409: This product is as amazing... its smells pretty great and the finish really leaves your skin soft and hydrated.\n",
      "Line3410: It's a good eye gel not really a cream. Really hydrating under the eyes. Not at all sticky or thick; just a refreshing, lightly scented gel.\n",
      "Line3411: Talk about a “fine line eliminator!” I received a small sample from Sephora and this product is truly amazing; hydration and crows feet blaster at it’s pure finest. I saw results within a week of utilizing my small sample up. I will be purchasing this product and incorporating it in my daily skin care routine.\n",
      "Line3412: I  L O V E this brand! I have been using this cream recently and is my go to! This brand is a huge deal right now... I have dry skin and this is awesome !\n",
      "Line3413: I LOVE this super hydrating eye balm. I've been testing out a sample fore a few days now, and I truly notice a difference. My under eyes are a lot more hydrated these colder months and I'm enjoying the results\n",
      "Line3414: Loveddd this stuff- huge container and hydrated so well. I would definitely recommend this if you’re in the market for a new eye cream! I received this product for complimentary purposes and all opinions are my own.\n",
      "Line3415: Currently using this. I’m digging it! It’s a great moisturizer. Keeps my bags at bay and offers the perfect amount of moisture for my under eye area. I also apply it above my eye brow as I tend to get dry there and it has combatted this greatly!\n",
      "Line3416: love this product! super moisturizing and I like that it doesn’t have a scent. perfect for sensitive skin.\n",
      "Line3417: Belif has been my favorites skin care for eye creams! I truly have fell in love with this one! I see a difference right away and mostly with my makeup. I used to always have a crease going on with my makeup and ever since I use this under my under eyes look amazing! I recommend it\n",
      "Line3418: So so so moisturizing!  It has no scent which is perfect.  It does not irritate my eyes.  I have seen a decrease in puffiness after use.\n",
      "Line3419: Very lightweight, yet moisturizing. I can see using this on my whole face in the summertime as a general moisturizer. I could do with a little less fragrance, but that’s just personal preference.\n",
      "Line3420: Very average, packaging is nice, nice scent. Feels lightweight on the skin. As to results, I might not be the right target for this product.\n",
      "Line3421: I really like this eye cream! I'm a huge fan of Belif, so when I first got a sample of the moisturizing eye bomb, I was really excited! It's a bit less thick than I had imagined (not that that's necessarily a bad thing) so it definitely works well during both the day, and at night. I happen to prefer a fairly thick eye cream at night, so I tend to use this during the day, where it works great! A little goes a long way, it goes on smoothly, and absorbs quickly, so it's a great base before eye makeup. The price tag for the full size is $48, which is a bit steep, but at least you get a very large amount for the price, so it'll last a good while. The mini sample I got in a sephora kit a while back lasted me months! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good all-purpose eye cream!\n",
      "Line3422: Super moisturizing and non greasy! I love everything about this line and the eye cream is no different. It’s perfect for applying underneath your concealer to prevent dryness and crackling I was surprised because it came in a much smaller container than the moisturizing bomb but I think this stuff is going to last me awhile. Perfect for the winter!\n",
      "Line3423: Received a sample of this in my Sephora play box. So far so good! I've been using it nightly for a couple of weeks. Does a great job at hydrating under my eyes and soaks in nicely. It has a nice creamy/gel texture and feels luxurious under the eyes. Nice and fresh scent. I'm anxious to see more long term effects but for now I'm enjoying as is! Would purchase full size.\n",
      "Line3424: I love this eye cream! I put it on at night before bed and it adds so much brightness and hydration to my eyes and you can tell the difference when I wake up in the morning! I have actually gotten compliments on how bright my eyes are after using this eye cream. The texture of it blends into my skin like water\n",
      "Line3425: LOVE this product. A little goes a long way. I use it at night as a part of my night routine after serums. It feels super moisturizing, great product.\n",
      "Line3426: This eye moisturizer helps plump up my fine lines and keep my eye area hydrated. I love it!\n",
      "Line3427: Purchased this eye cream about two weeks ago from Sephora and have been loving it. I’m in my late twenties and was looking for elasticity and hydration. This claims hydration up to 26 hours and creates a base for Concealer. This has helped my under eye concealer appear smooth even after setting with a powder my under eye has not been feeling as dry. There is hardly any scent to this and the packaging is a nice blue. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for deep hydration for their under eye.\n",
      "Line3428: This is a amazing product it is super hydrating and moisturizing it feels like your skin has drank a tall glass of water I highly recommend this product you need to try it for yourself\n",
      "Line3429: I’m in my 30’s so dry under eyes and aging is a concern of mine of course. This cream works wonderfully to keep under eyes hydrated, and in the process keeps makeup in that area looking flawless. However, I noticed one of the ingredients is silicone so I only use from time to time for that reason. I will tolerate some silicones in my foundation, but I try to stay away from it in my skin care.  This may be why some people say they had issues with it causing bumps around the eye area.\n",
      "Line3430: I use this as a night time eye cream and it works very well. I use it both underneath my eyes and on my lids. It leaves my under eye looking hydrated and refreshed.\n",
      "Line3431: I received this in a Sephora Play! Bag, and the small sample lasted about 1 month. This eye cream was slick and absorbed quickly into my skin. It was comfortable and lightweight and my makeup looked pretty good on top. My skin is very dry and my concealer does crease even with this eye cream which is normal for me. I do think there might be an increase in texture under my eye since starting use but now that it's gone I'll see if there is a change. The eye cream didn't cause any milia. For the price I'm not sure it's worth it as I didn't see any reduction in fine lines. But if you want to try it it's a nice option. I prefer the Algenist eye balm over this though.\n",
      "Line3432: I received this in one of my sephora play's bag and have been using it since. Even though this product is not on the cheap side but I would like to buy the actual product in the future. It doesn't have a fragrance and the texture is silky so this is safe to use on any type of skin in my view. I have naturally puffy eyes and I have noticed a difference after using this almost daily.\n",
      "Line3433: I just love this stuff, the smell, the texture/consistency and I do see a difference with my under eyes in regards to hydration\n",
      "Line3434: I love this eye cream so much! I appreciate that this product delivers on its' promises stated on the packaging that is moisturizing properties. The consistency is gel like but it relatively quickly absorbs into the skin. It does not leave any residue or a glistening effect. So no need to rub it in after the initial application. The skin feels smooth and supple. I can freely move my fave and not feel any tightening, or having wrinkles forms.\n",
      "Line3435: I got a sample of this product in a subscription box. I've been using it nightly before bed,  and I've noticed a big difference in my under eye area. I have less fine lines & discoloration since using it. I really like this company's products!\n",
      "Line3436: Just what it says...BOMB of moisture. A little goes a long way. This will last a long time\n",
      "Line3437: My under eye area is desperately dry. After receiving this as a sample and using morning and night, the results are incredible! I no longer struggle with that “scaly” look of dried concealer and feel confident that the moisture will last all day. Belif makes incredible products!\n",
      "Line3438: I love this! I truly have noticed a difference after using this for the past few months. It’s easy to apply, one jar lasts forever and it keeps my eyes moisturized and the fine lines away. 10/10 recommend.\n",
      "Line3439: So moisturizing! I always used the kiehls and this gives it a run for its money! It’s very lightweight and there is a decent amount of product in the container\n",
      "Line3440: AMAZING doesn’t even begin to cover how I feel with this on. I’ve been going out with no foundation or concealer and just a few dabs of the moisturizing eye bomb ever morning.\n",
      "Line3441: I’ve never used a eye cream before and when I tried this one I was blown away it was just so hydrating and refreshing under the eye! Highly recommend!!\n",
      "Line3442: I really love this product. I received it in a Belif Traveling kit as a small, travel size and was so sad when it ran out. I haven’t found another more hydrating eye cream out there, so this will be my staple unless something better comes along.\n",
      "Line3443: Fantastic product. It smells and feels amazing, both in the package and on your skin. I have a very delicate and sensitive eye area and this is one of my favorite products ever. It feels cool and soothing when applied and I just love it. Five stars all day!\n",
      "Line3444: This is truly a moisturizing bomb. It’s thick and creamy, and goes on in a thick layer. It smells nice, and is very hydrating. It states that you can wear it under makeup, but I haven’t found that to be the case. It’s much better if you use it at night in your nighttime skincare routine.\n",
      "Line3445: I am only 24, but my under eyes are so dry, and I have one pretty deep line. This is the only eye cream that has helped with that dryness (immediately and over time), and has helped to soften that line when being worn. It works great in conjunction with my foundation and concealer.\n",
      "Line3446: I used this for about a week and it cause a bubble under my eye. Too much moisture for my skin\n",
      "Line3447: Bought this because it was so highly reviewed on Sephora and I was not disappointed. I've been using it about 3 months now and have noticed a difference in my fine lines. My eyelids look more plump and feel calmer after I use this. I layer a sunscreen on top of it for day wear. It smells wonderful too - almost like a blend of jasmine and citrus. Feels like an aromatherapy experience whenever I use it.\n",
      "Line3448: Can i rate this 10 stars?? Wow i got this as a sample packet from sephora. The packet has .10mL of product and it has lasted me three weeks with everyday use. This eye cream is actually the best ive ever tried. It does not make my sensitive eyes burn, it smells very natural almost herbal, the hydration level is unreal! Where was this all my life. I was so shocked at the results i went out and bought it!\n",
      "Line3449: It definitely did what it said it would do. Moisturized my undereye. It doesn’t take away any dark circles or puffiness that I noticed but I do like the smell and the refreshing feel of it!\n",
      "Line3450: I’m on the fence on this product. It’s definitely moisturizing but I feel like it makes my under eyes appear more puffy then they usually are!? If I were you I’d grab a sample before purchasing the full size!\n",
      "Line3451: I really like this eye cream. It's somewhere between a gel and a cream, which makes it versatile enough for anyone to use. I use it every day and night and don't need to use much product to cover my eye area. It has a very pleasant light scent and is gentle enough for sensitive skin. It also comes with a decent amount of product. Only downside is the packaging seems a little bulky for the amount of product inside. Not a huge problem for me, but just an observation. I would highly recommend this product; it's totally worth it.\n",
      "Line3452: This is currently my favorite eye cream. It is super moisturizing. I use it day and night and enjoy it. I received it as a sample and will purchase a full-size.\n",
      "Line3453: I received a sample from Sephora and was super surprised by the density of this eye cream. I usually use Lush’s Enchanted eye cream, which is light, soothing, and the only eye cream I’ve ever seen any difference with. Due to the richness of the Belif I was skeptical I’d see the same results that people seem to see; I’ve been surprised. This works well for taking down some puffiness from allergies, is helping with my baby crow’s feet, and sinks into my skin quickly without being sticky. However, I’ve been particularly sleep-deprived the past few days and have really pronounced bags under my eyes and I haven’t seen a big difference in effectiveness. Overall it’s a good product but would love to see results in longer usage.\n",
      "Line3454: I am in love with eye cream! I have started to use it in my everyday routine. I still have my full size sample that was sent to me and it last for a while! I 100% recommend this product, it noticeably feel and a difference in my eyes!\n",
      "Line3455: LOVE THIS! I got it free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is a great product! I’m still using it in my nightly routine! My only negative thought about this product (that I’ve also mentioned in other reviews) is that I don’t love sticking my fingers into the pot to get product. Even though my hands are clean it just doesn’t feel super sanitary. Other than that I love this product! Thank god i have a full size pot though because it is a little expensive!\n",
      "Line3456: I am currently using this eye cream as a sample received in my Sephora play box. I love it but I do not see myself purchasing. It is very hydrating yes but does nothing for fine lines and wrinkles, bye bye under eye does it all\n",
      "Line3457: I absolutely love this product! Super moisturizing and it does what it claims to do! Definitely a must have!!!\n",
      "Line3458: I love this eye cream! I have super sensitive skin that can be dry at times. This cream doesn’t have a strong scent and is thick but absorbs into the skin very nicely. It held the hydration through my stressful long shift at the hospital. I feel it’s helped slightly with my dark circles too! I will continue to use this! :D\n",
      "Line3459: HOLY GRAIL EYE CREAM. This stuff is seriously the best. I first discovered the aqua bomb moisturizer through a sephora sample and fell in love. Wanting to try more from the brand but being a 20 something and fully convinced I didn’t need an eye cream yet, I put my faith in the brand and discovered that my eyes had been missing out! So moisturizing and has helped fine lines I didn’t even realize I had.\n",
      "Line3460: I got this in a Sephora play box and I was surprised how much I like it. It does moisturize well and it doesn’t not irritate or burn my eyes.\n",
      "Line3461: LOVE LOVE LOVE this eye cream! Belif was not playing around with this eye bomb. It comes packing with tons of moisture that had immediate results. I've already bought my second batch! Truly heaven in a bottle!\n",
      "Line3462: Loved this eye cream!! It’s so lightweight but so hydrating. Everyone needs to try this. It makes my under eyes look so smooth and firm!\n",
      "Line3463: I really like this eye cream and the whole belif brand. It's super moisturizing and feels lovely on the skin. Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "Line3464: Love this stuff. Light gel like texture but highly moisturizing, goes on smooth and feels great\n",
      "Line3465: A substantive cream that really makes my eye area feel bathed in moisture.  Am always tempted just to use this on my entire face... but the face cream is great too!\n",
      "Line3466: Amazing. Keeps my under eyes hydrated and refreshed. A lot going a long way. I definitely recommend. Packing is amazing and luxe. Buy it! You definitely won’t regret it. Thanks Influenster for sending it\n",
      "Line3467: Almost feels balmy in texture instead of creamy. Seems to work well on my fine lines and a little goes a long way.\n",
      "Line3468: I absolutely love all of belifs products. This eye cream was amazing! Smooth and weightless\n",
      "Line3469: I got this in my Sephora Play bag last month and have been trying it out. Its a little too soon to see full results but i have noticed my eye lids are a little less hooded. We shall see!\n",
      "Line3470: This is a super light gel like formula. It goes on super smooth, the eye area really absorbs it quickly. Almost like a cup of water for your under eyes. Worked really well under makeup. A definite must try for great hydration.\n",
      "Line3471: I have two sample sizes of these because I love it so much but don’t want to spend the money on the full size. This has reduced the baggies and dryness under my eyes and makes makeup application look so much better.\n",
      "Line3472: This product had such good reviews on Sephora’s website and I was so excited to try my sample. It was a let down. I found that it didn’t do much in the way of hydration and that the product balled up on my skin. It wasn’t what I was expecting from this brand.\n",
      "Line3473: This eye cream is great. I love the medium thickness and it absorbs so well underneath the eye. I felt like it didn’t affect my makeup at all, which is a huge plus.\n",
      "Line3474: Not sure if it is supposed to help with the appearance of wrinkles or not, but it is very hydrating and soothing!\n",
      "Line3475: This stuff is amazing! I have used a few different  brands but this really does work. At night the skin under my eyes gets to tight after I wash my face. All I need is a little dab of this and my skin feels amazing! Like I said, Amazing!!\n",
      "Line3476: While this is a very nice eye cream, it’s not something I would go out of my way to repurchase. I only use it at night because it makes my eye makeup ball up\n",
      "Line3477: One of the best moisturizing eye creams I’ve ever used! It is so light weight, sinks into the skin incredibly quickly because of its gel texture, and leaves my under eyes looking plump and hydrated! Would definitely buy again!\n",
      "Line3478: My absolute favorite works amazing on the eyes a bit pricey but last a long time very gentle\n",
      "Line3479: I have been using this product for a bit now. I received it from Influenster. I am still using it. I only use it at night, maybe if I use it in the morning too I would see better results. But even with just night time. My undereyes usually feel hydrated! Love it!\n",
      "Line3480: This stuff is unbelievably moisturizing and although entirely unrelated to the efficacy of the product, I love that shade of blue on the container. It has a lightweight formula that applies smoothly, absorbs easily, and isn’t irritating to my eyes. My main concern at the moment is hydration/moisturizing properties and less with fine lines (the rock climbing staff refused to believe that I graduated college almost a decade ago), so this definitely does the trick for me! This eye cream is also free of synthetic fragrances/dyes, and the brand is cruelty-free! I’m docking a star only because of affordability (I wish it were cheaper!).\n",
      "Line3481: I really love this eye cream! It's the perfect amount of moisturization while being the right consistency to apply. It doesn't have a heavy scent at all, which is fabulous, and it is very gentle to the skin. Even though it is a bit pricey, it lasts what feels like forever! I only need a tiny bit to apply and my skin feels so smooth and fresh. I think this cream is really best served as being worn to bed since it can be hard to have makeup stay on top of it. Definitely worth the money and one of the best eye creams I have tried!\n",
      "Line3482: Smells amazing and feels hydrating. However, it definitely burned the under eye area of my skin which is unusual for me because my skin is never that reactive like that\n",
      "Line3483: I really like the moisture it provides. It really helps when you're trying to bake and finish your powders. Makes application a snap\n",
      "Line3484: Awesome product!! I actually ended up repurchasing this after I finished the one that was sent to me! I will likely continue to repurchase this unless I find something better. Only thing I would change is the packaging.\n",
      "Line3485: This is one of my fav skincare products. I keep it in the fridge and it works great to depuff my eyes in the morning. It’s also super soothing to put on after scrubbing off heavy eye makeup. It’s lasting me a while since you don’t need to use much\n",
      "Line3486: Great product! Definitely recommend. Pricey but worth it! Leaves skin hydrated & soft\n",
      "Line3487: Great product....would definitely highly recommend to others....great price. Love love love!\n",
      "Line3488: This cream gives moisture And refresh the eyes area, but if feel sticky and I don't like it. Is going to use it in the morning before the eye makeup.\n",
      "Line3489: I absolutely love this eye cream! Belif is such a great brand, and their eye cream works so well with their other moisturizers. It’s hard for me to find an eye cream that moisturizes without any stickiness or weird texture, but this one makes my eye area feel so soft and not greasy or sticky at all. It also seems to keep the area nice and plump which minimizes my dark circles and fine lines.\n",
      "Line3490: This eye cream does its job of moisturizing. I have really sensitive skin and it didn’t aggravate it at all. The scent is nice and clean and reminds me of a spa. My only wish is that it would also take care of fine lines.\n",
      "Line3491: Eye bomb is right!!! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb is freaking amazing!!!!! During this winter months, my skin has been super dry and this is especially true when it comes to my under eyes, they have been very dry and dull looking! After I wash my face, I put this eye bomb cream on my under eyes and boom! They are instantly hydrated and looks less puff! While this product this a bit pricey, I believe it is worth every penny spent\n",
      "Line3492: Feels very nice on the skin. Def makes the lines around my eyes less noticeable. Has a light fresh scent. So very moisturizing. I didn’t think I’d like it as much as I do. Lasts a very long time too.\n",
      "Line3493: One of the best eye creams ever. So hydrating and smells so good! I feel like it wake up my eyes in the morning!\n",
      "Line3494: I love love love this eye cream. It’s so hydrating for my dry parched under eyes. It’s super comfortable to wear and works well with my other products. The packaging is great and I highly recommend and will also repurchase.\n",
      "Line3495: I received a deluxe sample of the Moisturizing Eye Bomb in a Belif Holiday Set. This eye cream has a lightweight texture that feels very refreshing. It provides up to 26 hours of moisture. Also, it smooths fine lines and wrinkles and increases elasticity and skin resilience for impeccable makeup application. I like this eye cream because it targets both of my major skincare concerns: dryness and anti-aging. I would definitely purchase the full-sized product.\n",
      "Line3496: This product is great! You only need a little and the container will last forever! It smells really good and is really hydrating. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it’s a great product all around and I love the way it feels but I’m not sure I notice a major difference in my under eyes.\n",
      "Line3497: Finally a product that I'm not allergic to! belif is the only brand that I can put on my face without having a bad reaction to it. And this just feels so soothing and makes my skin feel bouncier\n",
      "Line3498: Got a sample of this little baby on my Play! by Sephora subscription. This eye cream does wonders and keeps the area around my eyes moisturized. It's light, smooth and very hydrating.\n",
      "Line3499: I love this stuff. It feel like my skin drinks it right in and makes the area feel so hydrated! It’s my new favorite eye cream\n",
      "Line3500: I have only used it a couple times so far but it is amazing so far! After three uses it started helping my dark circles! I am gonna see how it works the next couple uses and go from there. Honestly so far, so good!\n",
      "Line3501: Loved this moisturizer! You get a lot in this tub and it really hydrates the undereye. Love this product would definitely recommend!! Only drawback was the swell was a bit unappealing but a great addition to my collection!\n",
      "Line3502: I love Belif! This stuff is fragrance free and nice on my sensitive skin. It absorbs well but also plumps up the under eye area. I use it before bed and really like it! I received it in a Sephora sub box.\n",
      "Line3503: This is hands down my favorite eye cream ever! It's fast to absorb, moisturizes my under eyes, and I have noticed a significant difference in my dark circles. The cream is cooling and feels good to just rub in. I have incorporated this cream into my daily routine, and will continue to repurchase :)\n",
      "Line3504: Might be my holy grail of all under eye creams next to Tatcha. This is was less expensive and just as effective . I started noticing a difference in my makeup immediately after I started using this . I tried this and Clinique . I ultimately liked this one better. It’s more creamier and thinner on the skin . I bought this from Sephora and will purchase again .\n",
      "Line3505: This is incredibly moisturizing! I can't say much about dark circle or bag reduction, but i apply this morning and night. When I use it under makeup, my under eyes look so much smoother!\n",
      "Line3506: This is the most hydrating eye cream I have ever tried! I put it on at night and in the morning, my undereyes are still moisturized\n",
      "Line3507: I received a sample of this product in my Sephora Play, and I am blown away by the results, not only is intensely moisturizing, but I have definitely noticed a great improvement in the fine lines around my eye's after only a week and half!!!! Definitely highly recommend this product!!!\n",
      "Line3508: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb checks off all the boxes when it comes to a quality moisturizing eye cream. This product claims to improve skin elasticity, and I can absolutely confirm this claim to be true.\n",
      "Line3509: This product is cool and refreshing under the eyes - I like applying it about every other day. I don’t usually have too much difficulty with dryness under my eyes, but it does feel moisturizing and I like to think I have seen some decrease in dullness in the skin around my eyes. I like that this uses natural ingredients.\n",
      "Line3510: Actually I did not buy this product I came in a box of Sephora. I love it and I love it, it's a good product for my eyes, it takes away even the dark circles\n",
      "Line3511: Absolutely love this item it truly love my skin feeling rejuvenated light and fresh. It’s super late and doesn’t way down or leave my skin will he not to mention I love the packaging\n",
      "Line3512: Just began using this and I’m in love! Adds a lot of needed moisture to my under eye area and everything appears more supple and nice looking. Really have been enjoying this eye cream and am considering purchasing when I run out.\n",
      "Line3513: This eye cream is pretty good ,cooling and very Hydrating. I have been using it for a few months now and I really like it. This product was send to me free from Influenster for testing purposes. But I  would definitely  purchase it.\n",
      "Line3514: Just started using this cream 2 weeks ago. So far I haven’t noticed any changes to my eye area. However, the cream itself feels thick without being greasy and I love the formula it feels quite hydrating. Still trying it out but so far so good.\n",
      "Line3515: Love this product!! Use this under your eyes before putting on concealer and your makeup will look fantastic all day. It has a very high level of moisturizing. Wait a minute after applying to sink into your skin.\n",
      "Line3516: I use this every night. It helps my eyes stay moisturized the next day. It isn't oily so my eyeshadow stays in place the next day\n",
      "Line3517: I was never a fan of eye creams (i know, i know it’s like can i really call myself a beauty guru??) i always felt like they were the greeting card holidays of the beauty industry.   This eye cream changed that for me. First off it’s creamy and moisturizing to the touch, without waking up a greasy mess. I’ve always looked younger than my age and have had a youthful presence to me, but this product will be my holy grail and secret weapon.  Skin Tone:  Neutral  Skin Type:  Oily  Skin Concerns:  Large PoresRednessSun Damage  Eyes:  Brown\n",
      "Line3518: I received a small sample in my Sephora play box. Been using it for two weeks and I’m impressed. I had a a dry patch in the upper part of my inner corner that I could not get rid of. I used this and it disappeared within two days and hasn’t come back. The cream absorbs well into my skin and keeps the area hydrated. Best eye cream I’ve tried from my Sephora play box.\n",
      "Line3519: Amazing!  Just like the regular moisturizer, the eye cream is fantastic!  I love everything about this stuff!\n",
      "Line3520: The best  eye bomb ever. I really recommend it. Really helpful product I Loved Mine. Worth the price\n",
      "Line3521: I am so glad I had the chance to try out this product. I have fallen in love with the belif line. The moisturizing eye bomb has hydrated my under eyes so drastically. It makes canceler go one smoother with less creasing. With this product came a sample size of their true cream - moisturizing bomb and I loved it so much I purchased in from Sephora. Great brand!\n",
      "Line3522: Was way too watery. Made my eyes have more wrinkles than before I started using it. I would not recommend or buy this product.\n",
      "Line3523: I really like this eye cream because it is thicker, but I haven’t seen as much change in fine lines and wrinkles. I only use it at night because it is a little thicker than I like under my eye makeup.\n",
      "Line3524: This product is changing my life as a mom of a newborn. I have the biggest bags under my eyes and seem to have tried every cream already. Using this before putting on my makeup wakes up my eyes and just makes me look more put together. Love it!\n",
      "Line3525: Belief moisture bomb eye cream. This product is just okay. I have a very dry eye area and this product was just not enough moisture to make a difference, especially with make up application. It was just enough moisture to give me some comfort, but doesn’t reduce the crepey-ness or flakes at all. Layered with an oil it works better, but I was looking for just a one step. If you have oily eyelids and are looking for an eye cream, I’d bet you’d love this product!\n",
      "Line3526: This eye bomb is the bomb!!!! Hands down best eye cream I have ever used. It’s so light and refreshing to apply. It’s moisturizes my undereye area without feeling greasy or oily. I hate a lot of thick creams for my undereye. It’s not generally a dry problem area for me but I still want to treat it well and take care of it. So far I am loving all the products from Belif. They’re well worth the money.\n",
      "Line3527: I really love the texture of this eye cream, its thick yet absorbs instantly into my skin.  It feels cooling and very moisturizing and doesn’t have a strong scent.  The only complaint I have about this is that when I put it on my upper lid and too close to my bottom lashline it makes my eyes water like crazy!!\n",
      "Line3528: Absolutely incredible! Do not know where to begin! If you have fine lines and wrinkles around the eye area this one is a must have!!!! Great texture, does to clump on the skin. Does not have a strong scent and great even if your skin is sensitive.\n",
      "Line3529: I've used this every morning for the past week. I haven't really seen any results but hopefully after the 3rd week I'll see something!!\n",
      "Line3530: Completely in love with this eye cream. It has definitely reduced fine lines and makes my eyes look brighter. I wear it in the morning and at night and love how my skin feels. I would definitely recommend this eye cream! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line3531: So very excited about using this eye boost! I have very dry undereyes, along with black circles. Super hydrating and goes on smooth and has a cooling effect in my opinion. Of course this is Korean, most of the goodies are! Will definitely buy again! belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line3532: I really love this eye moisturizer from Belif! It doesn’t irritate my eyes at all, it’s very gentle. It feels super refreshing and hydrating. The price range is good too compared to other high end eye creams, and a little bit goes a long way. I love the way my skin feels after using it!\n",
      "Line3533: Receives this in an influenster voxbox, and I am still using it. It’s not my absolute favorite as far as potency, but I like it for everyday.\n",
      "Line3534: I was sent this by Influenster, and let me tell you---I am SO Thankful! This is one of my favorite parts of my skincare product. It exceeded any expectations I had. You can certainly tell the difference of when I wear it and when I don't. So good!\n",
      "Line3535: Its a really moisturizing eye cream. I use it for couple months already and I see a little bit of improvement. I didn’t have a dark circles or wrinkles thou. I will buy again.\n",
      "Line3536: So much moisture! My eyes feel a sense of relief when I put this on—love how my skins feels with this.\n",
      "Line3537: I got a sample from Sephora play box and I like this eye cream so far. It is moisturizing and sometimes I even use it if I get dry patches on my face. I can use it under my concealer and it does not cake. Smells good, packaging is cute. Like it!\n",
      "Line3538: I really like the moisturizing eye bomb, it absorbs quickly and does not irritate my skin. It is also not greasy or leave a nasty residue as a lot of other eye moisturizers do. I would highly recommend this product as it works really well! I also like the light fresh scent it has.\n",
      "Line3539: My hg eye cream! It is light but powerful. Keeps my dry under eyes at bay and reduced the visibility of my little lines. Great price!\n",
      "Line3540: I can't say enough great things about this eye moisturizer. It has a gel consistency and absorbs instantly. Leaves a slight sheen that makes you look more awake. Also works well under makeup and on stressed/sensitive skin.\n",
      "Line3541: I just started using this because I got a sample and so far so good. It leaves my under eye hydrated. I'm considering using it only at night because I'm not sure that it's sitting well under makeup.\n",
      "Line3542: Love this line! It is truly my holy grail skincare. My skin feels so soft and moisturized after using this eye cream. It is thick and rich feeling. I love it and would recommend this for people with dry skin, or trying to prevent fine lines and wrinkles.\n",
      "Line3543: Rich formula. It feels very refreshing under my eyes and it absorbs in about 30 sec to a minute. I like to use it in the AM and night but I have not seen a reduction in my dark circles yet so don’t expect it to help with that. I give it 5 stars for its moisturizing purposes though  I just feel like I’m preventing crows feet with it👏\n",
      "Line3544: It’s a good moisturizer but it dried my face out so I had to stop using it. It works though, I felt that when I used it without applying any makeup it worked for me.\n",
      "Line3545: I loved this product, it did make my eyes water in harsh weather but it made my under eyes so soft and depuffed them. also created a really amazing base for my concealer and foundation.  I loved it so much.\n",
      "Line3546: Every time I wear this product it gives me an instant woken up feeling because of the cooling sensation it gives! Love this in the morning when I need an extra boost\n",
      "Line3547: Very good eye cream. Very gentle and it smells great! I was able to see the results in less than one week of use. It can be used before make up or before going to sleep after a long day. I would definitely recommend it.\n",
      "Line3548: This eye cream is super silky and creamy and does really hydrate my under eye area well. It’s not my absolute favorite eye cream but I will use it here and there. I haven’t notice a difference in my dark circles but it does hydrate my eyes\n",
      "Line3549: Had gone to sephora for some concealer, the girl who was helping me recommend me the eye bomb and saw a HUGE difference within two days.\n",
      "Line3550: Super mositurizing eye cream! it's super rich but not greasy! I love using this before bed, it's so soothing. You don't need much and I like alternating this with another more light weight eye cream\n",
      "Line3551: I received this in my Play bag. I need to use so little of this that the sample will last me a loooong time, especially since I need it only once a day. Takes a little time to absorb, but the softness remains even when I wash my face (water only) in the morning when I get up. I am noticing an improvement of the skin under my eyes too: it just looks better with less texture, and the skin feels softer. It's pricey at $48, but considering how long it would last, I just may pick it up once my sample is gone.\n",
      "Line3552: I liked the texture and coolness of it but unfortunately it made my eyes sting! :( I think it would be better suited for someone with less sensitive skin.\n",
      "Line3553: I REALLY love this product. i wish that the bottle was bigger! It did really make me feel refreshed and way more awake around th eye area! I feel like the skin around was overall way more rejuevenated!\n",
      "Line3554: Im bummed  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb  didn't do much for me after reading the reviews I thought yeaayyy it's going to get rid of my dark puffy under eye.  Sadly it didn't change the appearance at all.  So the hunt continues to find a cream that gets rid of my dark circles and puffiness\n",
      "Line3555: I recently just got into skincare and I can definitely say this is going to be a staple product for my skincare routine. It leaves my under eyes so hydrated and when I do my makeup my concealer blends like a dream. I use it day and night and it doesn’t feel heavy on my skin at all. I also have very sensitive skin and eyes and personally I’ve never had a reaction to the cream. A BIG plus for me!\n",
      "Line3556: I’m pleasantly surprised with this. I mean I was pretty sure I’d like it, but I wanted to try some new eye creams and someone at Sephora made me a sample of this. I feel like this is an easy-go to option for people that are looking for instant hydration. I was looking for more anti-aging benefits, but it’s definitely hydrating if that’s all you need!\n",
      "Line3557: This stuff is pure eye gold, smells great, the texture and feel is so smooth and light, I wear it at night and wake up to my eyes feeling refreshed and tightened. Cute packaging too! Def worth the price\n",
      "Line3558: It’s my holy grail!! I looove so much because feel my eyes so hydrated, light and give me a cooling effect! Really likes! I recommend this one especially if you have oily or combo skin!\n",
      "Line3559: I love this! I’ve never been an avid eye cream user. But this one is extremely hydrating. ESPECIALLY during the winter time. I don’t wake up with puffy eyes when i apply this before bed. And a little bit goes a long way!\n",
      "Line3560: This product is really good. It matched with my skin which is a little bit mixed.  I got it for free from Influenster but for sure I’ll keep using it. I have friend that use it as well and they completely love it.\n",
      "Line3561: I love this eye cream! A lot of times I am hesitant about putting them on before my makeup but I have had absolutely no issues with creasing or the formula being too thick! It’s a nice lightweight consistency and I do believe the fine lines have been reduced after using this product! I love it and will continue to purchase!\n",
      "Line3562: I love this eye cream! It is very hydrating! I really love the scent and a little product goes a long way, which makes it worth the price.\n",
      "Line3563: This eye cream is amazing! Light-weight (no tacky consistency whatsoever!) with a spa like fragrance, and not to mention there's so much product inside. You only need just a little bit each time you use it. It honestly makes me look and feel refreshed and awake the next morning.\n",
      "Line3564: SO INCREDIBLE!! i tried this in store and my brother said i looked more awake just two minutes later and then my min cant get enough it too! its like taking a cold shower. it’ll REALLY wake you up. i recommend it to everyone. 😊\n",
      "Line3565: I am a female in my 20s with oily, acne-prone skin. I loved this product. It has a lightweight, almost gel-cream texture that I enjoyed. It felt great underneath my eyes. It was light enough to use AM and PM and did not interfere with my makeup application. It did a great job of leaving my undereye area soft and moisturized. I have already repurchased this product.\n",
      "Line3566: I like this eye cream. It’s very rich and moisturizing but it doesn’t feel heavy and it sinks into the skin quickly. It has a subtle herbal/floral scent which is nice. A little goes a long way so the jar lasts while. Doesn’t do much for dark circles though which disappointed me. But overall it’s good.\n",
      "Line3567: Love the way this product looks even before you even open it, i use it every morning after I wash my face and I can really see a difference, definitely met my expectations and then some it is a nice light cream not heavy at all and a little goes a long way. Highly recommend\n",
      "Line3568: Absolutely the favorite of products I’ve received! This product is saving my under eye area. Reducing the texture and evening out the tones. Keeps hydrated. I have combo skin and it keeps dryness at bay.\n",
      "Line3569: I love how moisturizing this product is!! A little goes a long way when it comes to this. I received a sample size in a beauty subscription box and I will definitely be purchasing again once I am out of my sample.\n",
      "Line3570: This moisturizer smells amazing, goes on smoothly and doesn’t crease under my makeup!  I highly recommend this product!\n",
      "Line3571: If your concealer is drying out your under eye area, this eye bomb is the bomb. Texture is like a thin Vaseline, smells like it a bit as well. This stuff is best worn over night because it can effect makeup application. The Sephora Play sample .17 fl Oz lasted 14days.\n",
      "Line3572: Love this product!! By far my favorite product Influenster has introduced me to! So moisturizing and makes my undereyes feel refreshed.\n",
      "Line3573: Best everyday eye cream. Not too oily, but provides the right amount of moisture. Definitely one of my favorites.\n",
      "Line3574: It is very moisturizing. I am not sure they do anything for fine lines. It is also good under makeup. It is gentle.\n",
      "Line3575: I received this as a deluxe sample which is why I even tried it. I've used supposed eye creams in the past and none did enough to be noticable so I couldn't justify the price. This is different though and I actually can tell a difference so it was worth it to buy the full size product. My undereye area stays hydrated and this helps keep the area smooth to help keep my makeup creasefree and looking fresh all day. I do have wrinkles or skin that is losing its firmness but I assume since it hydrates like it claims that it will work on those issues hopefully containing them and keeping my skin tight and youthful looking. It takes just a dab of product so for the price it's going to last for so very long. It's a great under eye hydrator. I now use this as a part of my daily skin care routine\n",
      "Line3576: Got this as a sample. The moisture bomb is true it does keep my dry skin moisturizer in this harsh dry winter. Love it and would recommend people to try it. Very effective and easy to apply. The consistency is just great\n",
      "Line3577: I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes from Influenster and I am sold! I am already a huge fan of the Belif brand, and this product is no exception. It works for both night time and day time use, and even sits beautifully under Concealer. I use his on top of an eye Serum and sometimes on top of an oil that I use under my eyes, and there are no issues with layering. The hydration lasts all day!\n",
      "Line3578: You. Guys...this product! I’ve have noticed a SIGNIFICANT change in my under eyes. No more oils, just moisturized and plumped! You need the tiiiiniest bit that goes a long way, so the price is definitely worth it!\n",
      "Line3579: I got this in my feb Sephora play box, tbh I love it soooo much!!! I know it says for the eyes but I use it all over my face lmao my face is moisturized but not greasy AT ALL. It’s super light, and doesn’t leave a residue on my face. Keeps my skin hydrated for a long time\n",
      "Line3580: Very good only con is I️t is a little heavy under your eyes so don’t use too much Less is more in this case very nice thought plus really hydrating\n",
      "Line3581: Love love love this eye cream! I got a sample through Sephoras monthly subscription box and I will definitely be purchasing a full size when its out. It smells fantastic and works like a dream\n",
      "Line3582: This is a lightweight eye cream that gives you a boost of moisture and refreshed looking eyes. It says to just apply a tiny bit around your eyes after applying moisturizer. I really like the way this eye cream smells, it smells fresh and awake, if that makes any sense at all. I love how thick this cream is while still feeling lightweight and non greasy. It gives your eyes and extra pep instantly.\n",
      "Line3583: I always use a different eye cream at night than i the morning.  Again, I suffer regular bouts of insomnia so I'm very picky about my eye creams.  This definitely makes the cut. I keep my eye creams in the fridge and I apply this one at night and it helps in conjunction with the Pep Start I y yaw in the morning at keeping redness and bags at bay so the next day, it always looks like I got a full night's rest\n",
      "Line3584: I use this eye cream during my night skin care routine and it seems to be doing something. It keeps the little bumps under my eyes away and makes me feel better about adding an eye cream to my night routine\n",
      "Line3585: This is a super lightweight, refreshing eye cream that smooths fine lines with a 26-hour burst of moisture, boosts elasticity, and increases the resilience of the skin for flawless makeup application.\n",
      "Line3586: I’m obsessed with this product! It smells so good! It hydrated my under eyes but didn’t make them oily, my makeup sits on top of it nicely! I will keep repurchasing. Totally worth the splurge!\n",
      "Line3587: Believe the hype. This stuff is my new addiction. Bought a travel sized one to try and eventually bought the full size. Goes on light, almost gel-like, and you only need a tiny bit to cover the eye area. It is ever-so-slightly cooling. Super refreshing. But boy, does it pack a punch when it comes to moisturizing. I CANNOT apply my under eye makeup without laying this down first. It makes my eyes feel so naturally hydrated without being thick or sticky. I live and die by this eye cream now, and would recommend it to literally anyone.\n",
      "Line3588: This eye cream is amazing. I love Belif eye creams. This version has a gel like consistency and feels super light. It absorbs quickly but feels extremely hydrating.\n",
      "Line3589: I was really skeptical of this at first because most of the products from the brand really seem to cater to oily skin and I have desert dry skin. However, after giving this a trial for two weeks I can absolutely see a difference in the dryness under my eyes and on my eye lids. I do not yet have any fine lines around my eyes so I can’t speak to that but I love the hydration that it has added! It makes my concealers stay better and crease so much less! I will repurchase when I run out\n",
      "Line3590: I really love this as an under eye cream for night. It’s on the thicker side so I’d advise using it at night but it really does moisturize your eyes and it does the job just by using a pea sized amount so it lasts you a long time for the price.\n",
      "Line3591: I love this product. Super moisturizing and lightweight. Cream product that goes on like gel and dries quickly. Makes my eye area look more moisturized and gives me a more awake look.\n",
      "Line3592: This makes my under eye area feel nice and moisturized and I tend to use it before bed. It’s pricier than what I’d like to pay for eye cream since I’ve not yet found an eye cream thats TRULY a game changer. This will not help with under eye darkness at all (no eye cream will) but It’s nice if you have dry under eyes or want to use it under a matte / full coverage concealer or foundation\n",
      "Line3593: I usually don’t invest in eye creams and such, but this one is really hydration and it makes my under eye concealer look so much better than before. I’m unaware of long term benefits but I like it so far. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line3594: I was never a fan of eye creams (i know, i know it’s like can i really call myself a beauty guru??) i always felt like they were the greeting card holidays of the beauty industry.   This eye cream changed that for me. First off it’s creamy and moisturizing to the touch, without waking up a greasy mess. I’ve always looked younger than my age and have had a youthful presence to me, but this product will be my holy grail and secret weapon.   After the first use you notice your skin looks more youthful yet smoother than before.   I would recommend this to anyone looking for an eye cream, especially for the gateway drug so to speak.\n",
      "Line3595: Love the way this eye bomb feels on the skin. It’s lightweight and does not leave the an oily residue.\n",
      "Line3596: I really like the Belif eye cream. It’s moisturizing and great for sensitive skin. It doesn’t have a fragrance and is not irritating.\n",
      "Line3597: This eye cream is amazing!!! I have severe dermatitis especially under my eyes. It gets really dry and irritated and this eye cream helped so much. I am so happy with it\n",
      "Line3598: It’s very lightweight and moisturizing. I didn’t notice anything wildly different with my skin but it didn’t cause any trouble to my skin either. I like that it doesn’t have harsh chemicals. Would try other things from this brand.\n",
      "Line3599: I use this every night underneath my eyes using my ring finger and dabbing it underneath my eyes until it’s well absorbed. The days I’m too lazy, I just spread across and let it dry. It’s very moisturizing and doesn’t irritate my skin at all.\n",
      "Line3600: Belif eye bomb is a miracle. I am in love love love with this product. Subscription of play sephora has made my life easier to try new products, this Belif eye bomb was received in play box. It is 5ml small bottle. Little goes tooo long.  Only after few uses, my dark eyelids and dark circles faded. My sensitive eye skin got tightened and moistured.  It has light scent, which is appealing and fresh. Will definitely buy regular sized bottle.\n",
      "Line3601: I love belif product because they work. Thus eye cream has changed my undereye skin texture over the months i have been using it. Definitely a great choice for any skin type, but especially good for dry skin.\n",
      "Line3602: This stuff is amazing. It leaves my skin feeling cool and moisturized. It doesn’t have a strong scent which I like because I hate constantly smelling products when I leave them on my face.\n",
      "Line3603: Love love love this eye moisturizer!!!!! It is so hydrating but still sinks into the skin. My Tarte Shape Tape sits on top of it nicely with no problems. It has been keeping my dry under eyes nice and moisturized, though it is pretty expensive. I will Be repurchasing, because this k beauty brand has been working wonders for my skin. I also use the moisturizing bomb face moisturizer and love it! Good for winter hydration\n",
      "Line3604: This was seriously one of my favorite products that I received from a vox box I still use this to this day it feels so good on the skin and I really recommend you guys picking it up\n",
      "Line3605: A great eye cream for night time. I enjoy this for deep moisture around my eyes, but I did have an issue with it. It kept balling up on my skin no matter how I used it. I tried using under and over other products, alone, etc. and after it sunk in it would ball up around my eyes. So I'm unsure if it actually kept the moisture in tact since it would peel away. I would never recommend this under makeup, I can't see it working that way, at least for me.\n",
      "Line3606: I love the consistency of this product! I don’t know if it’s honestly doing anything for fine lines. I love it for its moisturizing properties! Great prep for eye makeup, it absorbs easily! I would definitely recommend this!\n",
      "Line3607: I just started using it. I got it from Sephora but as of now it’s true to what it stands by. It’s just a little sample size but I am prepared to make this dire purchase. I’m excited that my eyes look well rested!\n",
      "Line3608: belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb great product it feels so soothing and fresh on my undereye area and smells amazing!\n",
      "Line3609: Love it best ever !! Thank you for sending this out for me leaves my face totally refreshed\n",
      "Line3610: This product is very moisturizing! The price is comparable to other eye moisturizers. My only complaint is that it takes a little while to dry before I can put on concealer or other makeup.\n",
      "Line3611: Super hydrating with out feeling greasy or heavy. It's great under makeup and feels very refreshing. A big plus is that it didn't cause any milia to pop up which is a struggle for me\n",
      "Line3612: This is super moisturizing and doesn’t interfere with makeup! Eye cream is very essential if you like to bake under your eyes. When worn overnight, this cream really smooths out the under eye area.\n",
      "Line3613: I love this eye cream. It’s a gel formula so it goes on super smooth and sinks in pretty much immediately. It really hydrates around my eyes and doesn’t leave any residue. I can put makeup on within a few minutes of application and it goes on with no issues.\n",
      "Line3614: I use this product every single day now. It's my favorite moisturizer out there. It doesn't leave me feeling oily which is my main concern. It leaves my skin extremely moisturized. This is my favorite moisturizer\n",
      "Line3615: This eye cream is super hydrating and goes on very smooth. I typically use this at night because for me when I wear it during the day it creates a film under my eye. When I wear over night I don’t get that film.\n",
      "Line3616: This product is amazing.. very moisturizing! The packaging is simple and it’s an easy product to find in most stores\n",
      "Line3617: This completely nourishes and hydrates your eyelids and under eyes and is extremely soothing.\n",
      "Line3618: I love the entire Belif Moisture Aqua Bomb line. The eye cream is the perfect gel/cream consistency and it feels amazing on. It leaves my under eyes plump and hydrated. I use it day and night.\n",
      "Line3619: I absolutely love this!!! My eyes drink it up,  i use this day and night! It wears well under makeup,  if I miss this step in my half awake morning routine I can definetly tell with how my makeup sits\n",
      "Line3620: I’m a big fan of the K beauty products. Belif is one of my favorite brands. Its reasonably priced for what you get and don’t get.  They leave out sulfates, parabens and phthalates. This cream is so moisturizing. It soaks right in. It really improves skin elasticity. I will be buying more Belif eye cream when my deluxe sample runs out.\n",
      "Line3621: This product is SUPER moisturizing and I love the way it feels on my skin. I don't care for the smell though- it smells like citronella to me (which if you live in FL like I do, that is not a smell you want on your face!). I'm using the product as it was given to me by Influenster to test, but I wouldn't buy it.\n",
      "Line3622: I wasn’t a fan of eye creams, but I guess  it was because I hadn’t found the one for me. Belif did won my heart (and my money) when I used this eye cream/ moisturizer, my skin felt truly hydrated with a single use, and it really helped me with my eye puffiness situation.  I’d recommend this eye cream any day and with my eyes closed (pun intended). IT REALLY WORKS!!\n",
      "Line3623: I am using this daily at the moment. It has a right texture for dry under eyes but now greasy. By looking at the name, I thought it would be light gel texture but it’s in between gel and cream. Highly recommend it!\n",
      "Line3624: This is one of the best products I have ever gotten. I got this free to try out from influenster! It is the best and now my new favorite daily product.\n",
      "Line3625: I absolutely love this product. Since winter has returned once again. I found my face drying up and getting extremely oily because my skin is overly dry. I tried Origins products but no help. I tried this one and omg my skin just drank it all up and my skin looks more vibrant and feels softer. I love it so so much!!! Try it and you will see what I mean!!\n",
      "Line3626: This smells so good, like lemon merengue and moisturizes without being greasy or cakey. I like the packaging too. Modern and cool.\n",
      "Line3627: I got this in a set at Sephora and I have really been liking it. It really keeps my eyes hydrated. I have pretty normal to dry skin but my T Zone gets oily. My under eyes are dry especially during the winter. This has helped so much. It’s very light and hydrating.\n",
      "Line3628: i love this brand first off. i have the moisturizer and got the holiday collection and it has a deluxe sample of this in it. its definitely nice and light weight, you dont feel like you have a heavy eye cream on at all. but your eyes are definitely moisturized! idk id ill buy a big size of it just bc i want some anti aging factors since im turning 30. but if ur under eyes just need a litrle moisture this is a great find!\n",
      "Line3629: This gel-like Cream is exactly what you would expect if you have tried the Moisturize Bomb Face Cream.  It’s very nice but I think it unnecessary if you already have the cream. Just use that instead of getting a separate eye cream.\n",
      "Line3630: Love this! I use it all over my face too. Very rich but not heavy. I love the smell and it doesn't bother my sensitive skin!\n",
      "Line3631: A nice eye cream for moisturizing the under the eye area. I got a sample size of this and a little goes a long way!\n",
      "Line3632: A tiny amount on your fingertip for each eye and you’re done. This cream feels so good and refreshing underneath your eyes. I swear I see a noticeable difference when I use this.\n",
      "Line3633: This product did nothing for me. I didn't feel it moisturized or hydrated around my eyes. It didn't help get rid of my dark circles. It was a waste.\n",
      "Line3634: This eye cream definitely leaves my undereyes feeling to hydrated! I love it! It's so gentle on my skin too worth the price!!\n",
      "Line3635: I love this product! It’s become a part of my everyday routine, especially now in the winter. The product feels lovely and my skin drinks it up quickly. I wish it had other beneficial products for anti-aging in it so I could cut down on other products. Overall a great purchase!\n",
      "Line3636: Love this eye cream is so moisturizing. It leaves my under eyes so smooth and ready for makeup.\n",
      "Line3637: I love this eye cream. It super hydrating and makes my skin feel nice and supple underneath my eyes!!! I love it so much and will continue to buy!!!\n",
      "Line3638: I’ve been on the hunt for the perfect eye cream for me. I’m only 20 so I wasn’t looking for anything too heavy or with anti aging properties. This is the perfect eye cream for me because it sinks into the eyes instantly and is extremely hydrating.\n",

      "Line3640: I really noticed a difference after using this eye cream for a few weeks. I will definitely be purchasing this when I run out. It’s a must have in my skincare routine now!\n",
      "Line3641: I am always skeptical of eye creams because I have fine wrinkles and puffiness (more genetic than anything else) and have had a hard time finding something that has helped reduce the lines/puff. However, the Belif eye bomb lived up to its promise of moisturizing. I noticed a difference in my undereye area after a few days of use (specifically when using this before bed) and some of the winter dryness I was experiencing went away. While I think this product would work best with continued use, it's definitely worth a try if you have undereye concerns!\n",

      "Line3650: Love the belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb! It went on smoothly, wasn't oily/greasy, and didn't have any particular scent so that was nice. The packaging was also really pretty so that's always a plus. Would totally recommend to friends & family.\n",
      "Line3651: I’m actually very impressed with this eye cream! It’s a god send if you have very chapped under eyes that tend to look crepey under makeup. It has drastically changed my under eyes just as all of belif’s products have done for my skin. I highly recommend\n",
      "Line3652: I really enjoy this eye cream! It’s nice and luxurious plus it’s super moisturizing. I’m 27 and it definitely helps with my fine lines. The price tag is a little steep but you’ll find that with most great eye creams. Belif is a great company and I always feel that their moisturizers are calming and do a phenomenal job of moisturizing.\n",

      "Line3656: I actually liked this eye cream and of the ones I’ve tried I feel like it’s the most effective. I had a deluxe sample and used it all up but I couldn’t quite bring myself to purchase the full size, it’s a bit pricey. I always add it to my cart tho\n",

      "Line3662: I tried a small sample of this from Sephora since I ran out of my normal eye cream I tried other belif items and they weren’t that good so I wouldn’t recommend this because of the price point I think the prices could be better on these products since they aren’t miracle workers\n",
      "Line3663: This is so light weight and comfortable! I love the formula and consistency of this. It’s a good price for the amount it brings\n",
      "Line3664: I’m not sure this has done much for my dark circles necessarily but because of its water-based consistency, it feels super hydrating under the eyes! I love putting this on in the morning to help wake me up after feeling the cooling effect as it dries.\n",

      "Line3671: Packaging was great!  The texture of the eye cream was just right- not too thick, however, I was hoping I would notice a little more of a difference with it.  I did notice some changes and it definitely has kept the area under my eyes moisturized but I was hoping for a little more.  Still would recommend and for the size of the container, you can't beat it.\n",
      "Line3672: This cream is so thick and hydrating under the eyes ! My eyes felt and looked more smoother it’s very effective I purchased mines at Sephora and it’s very gentle under my eyes and doesn’t break me out at all ! This Belif product fits the bill perfectly! As others have mentioned, its texture is somewhere between a gel and a cream. I think this allows it to soak in and be very hydrating like a cream while not leaving a greasy residue. That makes this a perfect morning eye cream for me as my under eye concealer then goes on smoothly and doesn't crease! I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes but all opinions are my own.\n",
      "Line3673: This stuff changed my routine. I love this so much it has helped with puffiness and fine lines. It feels so light and soft under the eyes and it’s quite refreshing.\n",

I received this product for testing purposes from Influenster\n",

      "Line3680: This is a super hydrating eye cream - if you have dry, crepe like under eyes, you will like this eye cream. It has a nice, non sticky texture that works well for night or day, and sits well under makeup. One jar will last you for a decent amount of time- totally worth it!\n",
      "Line3681: My under-eye area gets so dry so i decided to give this a try and incorporate it into my skincare routine and I’m loving it. Not only are my under-eyes moisturized but it also helps with creasing when I apply concealer.\n",
      "Line3682: I really like this stuff! My under eye area is fairly dry and creases pretty bad when I wear makeup, but when putting this cream on beforehand it makes a pretty big difference. I also only got a sample of this and it has lasted me so long. I will probably purchase this when my sample runs out.\n",
      "Line3683: I received this as part of a VoxBox and fell in love with the brand as I had not been aware of it in the past. I have always used eye serums/ creams as prevention and to keep them well hydrated and this cream does exactly that. The price is reasonable as you receive a decent amount of product and the cream does what it says, and HYDRATES.\n",
      "Line3684: Love this eye cream! Great moisture not sticky. Lasts all day. I have early signs of eye aging and this keeps my eye area moisturized.\n",
      "Line3685: Really nourishing and moisturising cream which goes perfect under makeup. Didn't see any effects on wrinkles or dark circles, and it doesn't claim either.\n",
      "Line3686: I love this whole entire brand of Aqua bomb from the face lotions or gels to the eye products if your skin is thirsty for moisture it will soak it right up\n",
      "Line3687: Got a few samples of this at GenBeauty NY ‘17 and I have been hooked ever since!! Love!!!\n",
      "Line3688: Belif has the best face moisturisers, so I was excited to receive a sample of this eye cream. Feels sooo nice on the skin, and very hydrating. I would buy this one for sure.\n",
      "Line3689: Nice thick moisturiser, especially for an overnight cream. Helped with my eye wrinkles and fine lines too! Definitely worth a try!\n",
      "Line3690: It freshens up my eyes. After a long week nothing gets my eyes a lift like this éter mask bomb. I didn’t purchase it at first but instead got a try out from Sephora and after i ran out went back straight for my bottle!\n",
      "Line3691: This is my favorite brand! Beliefs eye cream is a gel/watery cream it is not thicker but it works amazingly! It smells really good too and helps the appearance of my under eyes look great after a few uses! I would highly recommend this brand!\n",
      "Line3692: Love love love this eye-cream for days where I need a bit of extra moisture. A little bit goes a long way, but makes my eyes appear more awake and it also helps with puffiness. I also love that this cream doesn't affect the application of my concealer - bravo!\n",
      "Line3693: Love this one! I got it for free from Influenster VoxBox. My under-eye is hydratedand feels smooth. Even applying my under eye concealer is even better now. I use to have very dry under eye and my concealer doesn’t look great on at all. I will be re purchasing this one again.\n",
      "Line3694: Those eye cream is fantastic! My under eye bags are not noticeable anymore and the skin is very soft!\n",
      "Line3695: Really liked this under eye moisturizer, mostly because of the texture and the cooling feel under eyes. I apply it before going to bed and again under makeup in the morning and I do believe it makes my under eye area look more plump and moisturized\n",
      "Line3696: I loved this product. In a few weeks I start to see real results in my eyes. They were dark but after start using Belief was moisturizer and lighter and some expressions lines was gone! And the best think is that there is lot of product and you don’t need to use too much which makes this product durability longer.\n",
      "Line3697: I’m really loving this.  The Aqua bomb is my all time favorite face moisturizer so I wanted to give this a try.  It does what it says it’s going to do. I have noticed a difference in the moisture under my eyes. In winter I usually do get fairly dry and my concealer starts to look crepey but not anymore with this eye creme\n",
      "Line3698: I got this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I can absolutely say that I would pay for this product! After using it for a few weeks there is definitely improvement with the wrinkles around my eyes. And it smells amazing and doesn’t irritate my eyes in the least bit. Definitely recommend!\n",

      "Line3700: Love this eye moisturizing cream! It doesn’t feel too heavy and sets in nicely over night. It’s very gentle and perfect for the freezing, dry winter.\n",
      "Line3701: Very hydrating!! Compares to most high end eye creams it is very gentle the smell isn’t horrible the packaging is boring doesn’t seem appealing or exciting at first glance. I personally wouldn’t buy this product just because I have one I already committed too.\n",
      "Line3702: This was my first time trying belif, and I am very impressed. It's a great value, and I can feel the intense moisturizing in the morning and throughout the day. It's made a big difference in my eye area. The overall area looks plump with moisture, and more youthful. Love it, will definitely purchase again.\n",
      "Line3703: It moisturizes well, but I haven't really seen any visible results. No brightening or lifting effect or anything like that. It's a decent eye cream, but I don't think the higher price is justified. I've tried less expensive creams that, in my opinion, work just as well.\n",
      "Line3704: So moisturizing! The packaging is amazing and easy to use. The product is thick, but not too greasy\n",
      "Line3705: Great moisture. No oily feeling after Application. Sinks into skin. Reduces puffiness.\n",

I can tell that it has minimized the appearance of fine lines around my eyes- I am very happy with this purchase!\n",
      "Line3708: The eye bomb worked wonders!! Made my skin feel super soft and very healthy. Never felt oily or like it was too much for my skin. Would definitely recommend to others who are looking for a great moisturizer ! Very happy with the product and use it every day!\n",
      "Line3709: I love this eye cream! Tap a little bit under your eyes to help minimize fine lines. Using this under foundation is life changing, my makeup ALWAYS used to crease into my fine lines which is never a good look. Now my makeup looks flawless all day!\n",
      "Line3710: I adore this eye cream! I like to wear it in the morning since it’s not very rich. Does a great job of moisturizing my undereye area and it helps my undereye concealer go on better. I do wish it had more wrinkly fighting ingredient, but I do like it and once my deluxe sample runs out, I will purchase the full size.\n",
      "Line3711: I really love this eye cream. I use it every night and have noticed less wrinkles and my eyes aren't as puffy. The packaging is really nice. I will repurchase when mine is gone. I recommend this product to anyone who has eye concerns.\n",
      "Line3712: This is very hydrating, and works very well for my sensitive eyes. The formula does not clog my pores, and makes the skin around my eyes feel less irritated during the dry winter. I think that this would work for all skin types.\n",
      "Line3713: Such a great product. It smells really good, it has a cooling sensation and it really feels hydrating. I really would recommend this product. Price is ok, you get what you pay for and that is great quality! I would definitely buy it again. I have really dry skin and this is such a great product for all my dry girls and boys out there :D\n",
      "Line3714: This keeps the skin around my eyes very well moisturized up until winter. At that point I have to add in a facial oil as well. I do love the feeling and smell of this product, and the price isn't too steep either.\n",
      "Line3715: I got a small travel size; did not see any significant improvement under my eyes...used it during the day and night; did not improve the dark circles under my eyes.\n",
      "Line3716: It is an awesome experience, thanks for the opportunity. It totally moisturized my skin in this winter time, with a soft touch. This is was my first time using the mosturizing bomb and for sure I will get more.\n",
      "Line3717: The BEST EVER. I'm so in love with this ... I promise it works great and you will never try a different product\n",
      "Line3718: I received this product for free via influenster for testing purposes and I absolutely LOVE it! It is a super hydrating product & delivers on all its claims. A little goes a long way so if you feel that this purchase is a splurge, rest assured you do get your bang for your buck.\n",
      "Line3719: Love this product. Lightweight & effective!!! I wasn’t sure if I’d use it at first... now it’s a staple.\n",

      "Line3722: Totally made a difference in hydration under my eyes! I noticed a difference within a matter of days!\n",
      "Line3723: This item makes your skin around your eye area stay hydrated through this dry season. Your eyes look very refreshed after a night rest in this product. One of the must have on my beauty routine now. Its a little pricey for the size.\n",
      "Line3724: I really a m a big fan of this eye cream ! Keeps my under eyes very hydrated, makes my concealer go on very smooth without creasing! I wear it every morning and every night ! 🙌.\n",
      "Line3725: This eye cream is amazing! I have super dry eyelids and skin in general so I apply this to the top of my eyes and all the way around to my under eye. It's not too thick, so it absorbs into the skin quickly! I use it every day!\n",
      "Line3726: I absolutely love this lotion. It has really help to combat my dry skin in the winter. It smells great and it doesn’t make your skin feel oily or gross after you put it on. Highly recommend it.\n",
      "Line3727: Best eye cream I've used so far! It's super hydrating and moisturizing and doesn't irritate my eyes. I also like the packaging and the amount of product inside. I mean, for the price it's definitely worth it since a little goes a long way. TIP: I usually place this inside the refrigerator for like an hour before I use it so it would have a cooling and refreshing feeling when applied!  Note: I received this belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb product free for testing purposes from Influenster. Reviews/opinions of the product are solely my own.\n",
      "Line3728: Soooooo good!! This is a game changer. I didn't get the point of eye creams (they're so expensive..) until I tried this. I got it for free in their Belief Vox Box to test, and I loved it. It is so moisturizing and soaks in immediately. It keeps you looking fresh and glowy and bright eyed all day!\n",
      "Line3729: I love this product! Highly moisturizing and is a great addition to my nighttime skincare routine. My skin always feels super hydrated in the morning and it doesn’t leave a heavy, oily, or greasy feel when applied. Unfortunately, I haven’t seen an improvement in wrinkles/creasing but I still use the product everyday anyways!\n",
      "Line3730: This is the best eye cream I have ever used! It not only is hydrating but my makeup also went to sooo smooth over top!\n",
      "Line3731: I really loved this product and it’s now a part of my every day routine. it truly works wonders and works to depuff your undereyes and really moisturizes them. The texture of the cream is great, it is thick and really gets the job done. I would recommend this product to everyone.\n",
      "Line3732: I think the biggest factor in that is that the Moisturizing eye bomb is the perfect combination of moisturizing (of course) with a nice texture and enough substance to stick around all day or night. I love the packaging and the size is very generous. I'm used to eye creams in little jars, but this one is a much more generous size and I've barely made a dent in it. It is a gel cream texture, not oily, and it absorbs well, but also protects the eye area so your skin doesn't just suck it up and leave the area dry again.\n",
      "Line3733: I am literally OBSESSED with this eye cream. It’s super moisturizing but not greasy at all, very lightweight, and acts as a really good primer under my makeup. It even smells good too! I’ve used a lot of eye creams in the past and this one by far is my favorite\n",
      "Line3734: it was hydrating, didn’t clump, or ball up! layered well under make up! but i saw no huge difference in dark circles! you get a good amount & only need a little to feel it hydrating your skin! i got my product free from influenster to review, but it is my honest opinion!\n",
      "Line3735: Love everything about this, It moisturizes and brightens my skin! I just wish, however, that the product itself wasn’t so heavy, as it leaves my skin feeling greasy. The product doesn’t try down, it remains oily. And although I love the affects of this product, I wish it wasn’t so heavy and greasy feeling.\n",
      "Line3736: I really love this product! Its name is not misleading, it intensely moisturizes the eye area. Its great for makeup application in reducing fine lines as well. I could definitely recommend to anyone who it looking for a hydrating eye cream!\n",
      "Line3737: I’ve never used an eye cream before but always wanted to so when I received this I was so excited. It leaves my under eyes so hydrated and it lasts all day! It also doesn’t feel tacky at all which I really like so I definitely recommend this to everyone\n",
      "Line3738: I really Like this product. I have tried a lot of face creams, wrinkle creams, and night creams. I feel that my skin looks moisturized and not as dry. I also see a difference in my fine lines. I would recommend.\n",
      "Line3739: I like this product. I got a small size as a stocking stuffer in a kit, and although it’s nice, I wouldn’t purchase the full size. It’s pretty mediocre. It’s very thin and gel like, so it does hydrate and make concealer apply nicely if the concealer is water based.\n",
      "Line3740: Love it!♡ It's a nice product that leaves the eyes area hydrated and good looking for hours... I got it complimentary from influenster but now is a must in my shopping list. Recommended!\n",

      "Line3745: This was amazing! I usually have ugly early stages of “wrinkles” and “crows feet” around my eyes but this seriously helped smooth out my skin as well as plump it back up and make it soft and supple again! I’m def going to be purchasing this over and over lol\n",
      "Line3746: Nice and moisturising . Set into the skin which was good before makeup application but I wound up wishing I could reply through out the day because I needed moisture\n",
      "Line3747: Loved this product. Got it for free from Influenster to test it out and feel in love. Super recommend\n",
      "Line3748: HOLY GRAIL HOLY GRAIL HOLY GRAIL. I love this so freaking much. Works wonders on my dry under eyes and changed my life. It’s pretty expensive but so worth it.\n",

      "Line3750: Sooooo moisturizing! Didn’t think this product would do as much as it did! My undereyes have been so dry it was making me look old! Come to the rescue box box with Belief moisture eye bomb! No dry undereyes here this is the bomb.com, seriously! belif Holly Jolly Hydration Set\n",
      "Line3751: I really like the texture of the eye bomb. It wasn't greasy and the smell was not off putting. It applies quite easily and is absorbed well under the eyes.

      "Line3755: LOVE this product. I've been a fan of belif since I first tried their moisturizer last year, and this eye cream made me an even bigger fan! The cream feels luxe and cooling on the skin, and smells great (although the scent is light and not overpowering). Helps with fine lines and brightening! Definitely recommend!!!\n",
      "Line3756: I am so obsessed with this moisturizing eye bomb that I am not sure I can live without it. It revitalizes my eyes and refreshes my skin. This is by far the best eye moisturizer that I have used and I will absolutely be purchasing this when I run out.\n",
      "Line3757: The eye bomb is a must have. It makes my eyes look so much more awake and alive. It super hydrates preventing wrinkles and helping stave off any more darkening. A little bit goes a long way. I use day and night.\n",
      "Line3758: This was an awesome eye cream if you are looking for hydration. It did not help with under eye darkness but it was great to keep things looking plump.\n",
      "Line3759: Best eye cream ever! I received this eye cream as a free sample, and have been using it for a month straight, morning and night. It’s extrmely moisturizing without being too heavy. Great for before concealed application and for fine lines and puffyenss because it’s so thin. A little bit goes a long way so it’s worth the price.\n",
      "Line3760: It was extremely moisturizing. When you put it on you felt it immediately hydrating the under eye and it didn’t leave any residue. It brightened a bit after a couple days and helped plump the fine lines, but it’s standout feature was the hydration.\n",
      "Line3761: This product is fantastic. I love it so much. It is so hydrating and feels so good around the eyes.\n",

      "Line3764: I really liked this eye moisturizer cream, however it wasn’t any better than some of the other products I already use. While it is very moisturizing it doesn’t help with swelling or puffiness. Therefore I don’t find it to be worth the cost it retails for. I got this as a freebie in my VoxBox but once I finish it I probably won’t purchase it on my own.\n",
      "Line3765: Miracle worker! Loving this! So smooth, no greasy residue! Works wonders underneath my makeup with no fine lines! Absolutely amazing! Highly recommend this product!\n",
      "Line3766: Obsessed!!!! Keeps my eye area feeling baby soft. I was originally sent this for testing purposes but I actually went ahead and repurchased for my sister and mom. They loved it as well!!\n",
      "Line3767: This product is a life saver. It is super hydrated and smell amazing. A little goes a long way.\n",
      "Line3768: Im blown away how amazing this eye cream is! It is my absolute favorite. I cannot believe how well it works. Its texture and what is does for my eyes just blows my mind. best eye cream ever!\n",
      "Line3769: Love this cream! Feels so soft and I love that I can wear it under my make up and doesn’t affect it at all. The smell is great also not to over powering.\n",
      "Line3770: Great product. It keeps my eyes looking and feeling refreshed and makes me look more awake for the day\n",
      "Line3771: This eye cream is really hydrating and absorbs very easily into the skin. It also has a slightly gel-like texture which makes it a bit cooling too.\n",
      "Line3772: I got this free in my VOX BOX, I have been really impressed with the results. Lots of moister not to heavy, I will definitely repurchase again\n",
      "Line3773: The cream is very hydrating and light weight. It doesn’t mess my make up. Makes my eye area feel very fresh. The size of the bottle is very generous. No perfume on it which is very nice.\n",
      "Line3774: The moisturizing eye bomb from promises up to 26 hours of intense moisture while boosting skin’s elasticity. I could feel the difference after application, and although the cream itself was heavy, it easily sunk into skin without leaving me feeling greasy or filmy.\n",
      "Line3775: Belif is my new favorite skincare brand omg everything i have tried is amazing and totally worth the money. My undereyes are always dry and full of wrinkles and puffy and just an overall nightmare even after a few uses my skin is so much more hydrated i still have wrinkles but i can see a decrease but im sure with a longer time use it will go away!\n",
      "Line3776: This product is AMAZING! I've been using Belif moisturizer for awhile now, and this is just as good. It has a calming and cooling effect on your eyes, and it has a light scent that is lovely. I noticed a difference after one use, so this is definitely a stable for me!\n",
      "Line3777: This is an amazing eye cream. It is nice and soft. It moisturizes very well. It is not thick and caky like.\n",
      "Line3778: After not knowing of this brand prior to receiving the belief Moisturizing Eye Bomb I have to say, I was excited to try this product but felt let down.  While his product absorbs quickly, I still felt like I saw many of my fine lines and tired eyes. It did seem to make the skin a little brighter but in terms of really hiding or helping reduce the lines around the eyes, I would not say this is my go to product  *I received this product complimentary for review purposes from Influenster\n",
      "Line3779: Thousand percent love this product and one of my favorites received so far complimentary from influenster.  It works amazing to relieve puffiness and tired eye, it is high shine and glistens so i keep it on till it absorbs before makeup application or use it at night. Have already repurchased\n",
      "Line3780: I highly recommend this eye aqua bomb. Esp for this drying cold weather. I love using it\n",
      "Line3781: This is one of the best eye creams I’ve ever tried. It very smooth  and it absorbs very quickly. It’s not greasy at all and it keeps my eye area moisturize for a while eight hours. This one is a keeper.\n",
      "Line3782: This is a great moisturizer! It also helps for my under eye concealer to go on smoother. It’s slightly cooling as it goes on and stays hydrated for a long time. However, it doesn’t really seem to be doing anything for my fine lines or wrinkles. My under eyes still crease throughout the day with makeup and my lines have not improved. It also hasn’t had any brightening affects. This is a really good moisturizer, but it’s on the pricey side to just be a moisturizer. I don’t think I will be repurchasing.\n",
      "Line3783: This is probably the most moisturizing under eye product I’ve tried. It’s supple and cold and keeps t moisturized! Just wish it was able to get rid of dark circles, other than that the product is perfect\n",
      "Line3784: It’s very moisturizing as it claims to be and helps dry undereyes a lot. It’s not as brightening as I thought it would be but that’s not the product’s fault. I would highly recommend this to other people though. ☺️\n",
      "Line3785: I just started using this not too long ago. I haven’t notice that big of a difference in my under eye appearance yet so I don’t want to give it 5 stars. It does what it claims to do. It is very expensive but you do get a lot out of it\n",
      "Line3786: This eye cream is amazing! It's winter where I am right now and this eye cream is extremely hydrating without being oily or greasy. It has lightweight formula and a pleasant scent. It absorbs quickly into the skin and I love it!\n",
      "Line3787: I tried this product out when it was a 100 Point perk at Sephora.  My dry undereyes and eye lids drink this stuff up!  It’s super hydrating and feels like a cooling gel on the eyes.  A little bit goes a long way.  When my sample is gone I will purchase the full size.\n",
      "Line3788: It’s moisturizing but honestly I haven’t seen any drastic changes to my puffy and eye bags. I love the brand though\n",
      "Line3789: Light weight texture, but packs a TON of moisture.   The Belif Moisturizing eye bomb glides on skin, is absorbed quickly, and keeps my needy under eye area looking fresh and smooth all day— under makeup or not.   I like that it doesn’t have a strong scent (really not much of a scent at all). The packaging is also super cute, I think I want to do my second bathroom in black and aquatic blue now.\n",
      "Line3790: I am completely obsessed with this eye cream!! It goes on smoothly and has very visible results!! This is the first time I have used this eye cream and I totally recommend it!! It has amazing moisturizing ingredients that provides a long lasting moisture!! It also has detoxifying ingredients such as comfrey leaf!! I will most definitely repurchase this product!!belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line3791: I purchase the holiday travel set that included a few of the Belif products. My two favorite items I tried were the face moisturizer (the actual name escapes me at the moment) and the Moisturizing Eye Bomb. This moisturizer has a nice consistency its not too thick or too liquidity which I like. It absorbs easily and doesn't leave any sticky residue (always a plus). I like the scent, it's not too strong and dissipates fast. I find that it's moisturizing enough for my under eyes.\n",
      "Line3792: I received this in my Vox Box and HOLY MOLY it is amazing. The BEST eye cream I have ever tried. It really does hydrate for 24 hours and leaves my under eyes bright, supple and hydrated. I love it and will be buying it again. It has reduced my fine lines and rid me of awful dry patches I would normally get near the inner corner of my eyes. LOVE LOVE LOVE\n",
      "Line3793: This has made me look so much fresher! I always look well rested now thanks to this eye cream. It’s helped eliminate lines and darkness under my eyes and has pumped in hydration!\n",
      "Line3794: Influenster and belif sent me this to try out and i have to say it came at the perfect time. I was doing research on eye creams and getting ready to go out and purchase one to try out and this was just dropped off at my doorstep! (It was fate I’m pretty sure). I really love this product. I was starting to notice some very fine lines under my eyes and I felt like my eyelids were very dry but after using this for a few weeks the eyes definitely feel a lot more hydrated eyeshadow eyeliner concealer all types of make up are so much easier to apply now and most importantly it really diminished the look of my fine lines. A very small amount goes a very long way for both eyes and you get a lot of product so this will definitely last you for a very very long time.  I highly recommend this product. I will be purchasing it when i run out for sure\n",
      "Line3795: I LOVE this product. WORTH the raves! It’s actually quite ALOT in a jar but would give a recommendation on the application: you honestly just need a pearl size for BOTH eyes. My first few times I put too much and started to get small bumps around my eyes. But it went away quickly and now it is fine. Would like the packaging to come with a spoon or such since I feel like it would help with the portion size control application\n",
      "Line3796: I was lucky enough to receive this product from Influenster and it came at the best time because I had just run out of my previous (ineffective) eye cream. I am one of those people that has always had bags and dark circles under my eyes (even when I was a kid)! This product was exactly what I needed. In fact, I like it so much that I would buy it at full price! The cream seems to be more of a lightweight, soothing gel. It also has a light herbal scent. The ingredients are meant to be highly hydrating and are also supposed to boost elasticity. After using this, the increased hydration is definitely noticeable, so this really helps prep my under eye area for makeup. I would absolutely recommend this product!\n",
      "Line3797: This eye cream is very moisturizing. I feel like there is a noticeable difference in just a few days. Works well under makeup but I use it mostly before bed. A little goes a long way.\n",
      "Line3798: I love this it is extra hydrating and it leaves your eyes hydrated for hours. Not only do I use this at night but I use this every time I go out and  before I apply my makeup. I would definitely buy again and recommend this to friends and family\n",
      "Line3799: This is a good eye cream! It is very similar in scent and texture to the aqua bomb. It has a light blue color, subtle herbal scent, and acts like a water cream. It provides high moisture and helps to plump up dry under eyes. I recommend trying it!\n",
      "Line3800: Super great eye cream for moisturizing and plumping the eye area by filling in fine lines! However I knocked off a star because it doesn’t really help with puffiness which is something I struggle with.\n",
      "Line3801: SO BOMB! Just like their moisturizing aqua bomb, my under eyes feels like it drank a gallon of water. Great for winter time when my face gets dry spots, especially under my eyes. Recommend 10/10!\n",
      "Line3802: Love this! I have dry skin and my under eyes do tend to be one of my more dry areas. This eyes cream is so nice at hydrating the under eye are, I use this as my daytime eye cream as it is great for use before makeup. It has a really nice texture, sinks in to the skin evenly and fast and doesn’t leave any kind of residue just supple skin. I think the price point is good for a high end brand. Definitely recommend!\n",
      "Line3803: I suffer from eczema around my eyes and this product is so moisturizing and calming!! You need such a small amount which makes it such a good value and it sinks it quickly. I use it at night so that I don’t have to worry about putting makeup on right over it.\n",
      "Line3804: Belif continues to impress me! All of their products are so hydrating. I have combination skin so the areas around my eye tend to be more oily than other parts of my face. I love that this moisturizer lasts the whole day without making eye area overly shiny/oily/greasy/etc. after hours of wear. A little goes a long way so I think for the amount of product you get, it’s well worth the price.\n",
      "Line3805: So hydrating and feels amazing on the skin! A good price for how much product you receive! It will last forever!!\n",
      "Line3806: I loooooooove this product! It is so refreshing and delicate with the skin around the eyes . This is a great product that comes in handy during winter time . It is nursing and the eyes don’t feel too heavy after application. It gives a great boost of moisture to the skin and I enjoy it !\n",
      "Line3807: i received the belif moisturizing eye bomb from influenster to test. while i am a huge fan of the fact this brand, specifically this product is paraben, sulfate, phtalate, mineral oil, etc. free i was not impressed enough to switch from the brand i already use (also free of these harmful ingredients).\n",
      "Line3808: I recently bought this from Sephora and it has been working well for me. I put this on my eyes before I go to bed and it keeps my skin very hydrated\n",
      "Line3809: This eye cream works wonders! It moisturizers and nourishes as well as brightens up your under eyes.\n",
      "Line3810: I really like this eye cream. It soaks well into my skin and goes well under makeup. When I use this eye cream I think my under eye concealer looks better.\n",
      "Line3811: I have hereditary dark circles and they have become noticeably lighter as well as the fine lines looking more plump and product now sweeping into them.\n",
      "Line3812: This was sent to me by Influenster and it is amazing. It depuffes my eyes left them feeling rejuvenated. I love that it doesn’t have a strong smell and that is water like cream. It is expensive but it is totally worth it.\n",
      "Line3813: I love this I product it does a great job at reducing puffiness and doesn’t allow your make up to settle into your fine lines\n",
      "Line3814: I love this brand. I use this eye cream daily. It amazingly moisturizing , without the oiliness : residue feeling that’s left behind but some other moisturizers. This skin around my eyes looks hydrated and less puffy. Loveee!!\n",
      "Line3815: I really don't like the texture of this eye cream. If you tap your finger into it, you will get almost no product on your finger. You really have to dig in there to get some out and then once on the undereyes, doesn't really do much. I feel like you have to use a lot to adequately moisturize the undereye area just prefer others to this.\n",
      "Line3816: I received this complimentary in my most recent voxbox and I LOVE it! I find a lot of eye creams to be too heavy for daytime but this one is unique in that you can apply makeup right on top of it yet still have hydration that lasts a good portion of the day. It's great for evening use as well. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Line3817: This is the ultimate eye cream. I sleep in this and wake up with my under eyes looking brighter and feeling more firm. I feel like I’ve been searching for the perfect eye cream forever and I think I’ve found it. Ugh. I can’t rave about Belif enough! Everything from this brand is A+.\n",
      "Line3818: This product is great it hydrates you very well all your eye feels fresh and awake when you apply the product. the consistency of the cream is very soft and it is absorbed quickly to the skin.\n",
      "Line3819: Sadly, I know the time has come for me to start looking into eye creams. I didn’t even know where to begin! CUE Belif VoxBox! Prior to receiving my gratis Moisturizing Eye Bomb, I dove into a rabbit hole and did as much research as I could.   I truly feel like I lucked out. This stuff is AMAZING! It’s incredibly lightweight yet hydrating. I feel instantly fresh when I apply it — and a little goes a long way!  Couldn’t be happier with this product.\n",
      "Line3820: I love belief but this was just ok for me. Not as moisturizing as the aqua bomb. I was disappointed.  Won't be repurchasing one I use this up.\n",
      "Line3821: It’s the best eye cream I’ve ever tried. I have terrible deep set eyes and dark circles. And I typically never use eye cream because I never noticed a difference. This eye cream is like giving your under eye a glass of water. It’s so refreshing and leaves my under eyes hydrated and makeup lays so much nicer on them now\n",
      "Line3822: This stuff feels so good and goes such a long way. I have been going through this tiny sample for such a long time. It feels great\n",
      "Line3823: I have the sample size  But will be buying the full size as soon as I run out This seems like it helped with my fine lines and made some go away!. And it's moisturize ur eyes very well my eyes never felt so smooth. You need this!!.!\n",
      "Line3824: Never thought I would ever leave a review like this on an eye cream, but... this stuff is awesome. I actually NOTICE a difference after using this only a couple days. The fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable. It's almost like this stuff plumps up the skin a bit. I look forward to continuing using this. I have NEVER used an eye cream that actually made a visual difference. This stuff is pricey but if you want something that really, truly works... try it out. I've used eye creams in the past simply for basic maintenance, and to keep my eyes hydrated.. But this here really actually makes a difference. The only con is that it has a rather thick consistency. It almost feels like putting Vaseline on your eyes, but not quite as thick as that. It does dry smooth but you can kinda feel it on your skin. This might be better suited as a night eye cream. Either way, it works. That's what's important.\n",
      "Line3825: I have not mosturized until recently because no one told me how to like do it to my face but this has been great for a first timer like me. I love the feeling of it.\n",
      "Line3826: I've been using this eye cream for about a month plus ans I must say that it's become a fave! Got it at Sephora when I went in to restock on some old faves and I don't regret it. Great under eye moisturizer, a bit 'thick' but gel like..packed with moisture. My eyes certainly look less parched.\n",
      "Line3827: I really love this moisturizer eye bomb. It is light weight but still very hydrating and refreshing feeling without feeling like you have too much product on your face\n",
      "Line3828: I got this as a deluxe sample from Sephora and really enjoyed it. The cream is thick and hydrating but blends out well. No offensive smell. Overall a really solid eye cream.\n",
      "Line3829: I received this in my Voxbox and am a big fan. I have puffy under eyes and this really helps keep it hydrated. I've seen a reduction in puffiness and the texture is so soft on my skin. I have been using patchology eye patches on top of the Eye bomb. I must say that this really has been helping my under eyes. My skin is not dry afterwards and when I put concealer on top, it goes on smoothly with no lines. I would recommend this product!  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line3830: When it comes to eye creams I am truly picky. Let me tell you this does not let you down. It provides superior hydration, quickly and it lasts! I use it as part of my night time regimine currently and then a micro dot in the morning under my makeup and I have not had any issues with mascara drop down or concealer creasing. These issues have plagued me FOREVER! If you are in need of a new eye cream do not hesitate to try this product. It definitely delivers!\n",
      "Line3831: I've been looking for a moisturizer for my oily skin and this one succeeded my expectations. This moisturizer last me the whole day and it is perfect for use during this cold and windy temperature. I love it and would definitely keep using it! Thank u Influenster.\n",
      "Line3832: Ive been using this eye cream during the day under my makeup for about a week now and loving the results. The gel like texture is absorbed very quickly by my skin and holds nicely under light make up throughout the day without making be look shiny or greasy. I have combination/ oily skin therefore having a hard time finding day creams that really work for me. This product is perfect and recommend giving it a shot for a combination/ oily skin type that needs a little eye moisture through these cold dryer months of winter.\n",
      "Line3833: Really nice moisturizing eye cream that can be used both during the day and at night! Very hydrating and can be worn under makeup if needed. This eye mask is also super smooth during application, def a must have!\n",
      "Line3834: This product is AMAZING. I received it complimentary in a VoxBox and I was skeptical because I never heard of belif's brand. After using the product for a few weeks, I'm sold. A little bit goes a long way. It's not too heavy and can be worn with makeup. There is definitely a difference in the skin around my eyes after these last few weeks of use. Worth the splurge!\n",
      "Line3835: I have eye allergies and this eye cream helps by moisturizing my undereye area and not causing me any allergies.  Amazing eye cream!\n",
      "Line3836: The Belif moisturizing eye bomb is perfect for active women like me. It wasn’t easy, but I spent about a week without drinking water to do a super test to this eye bomb, (don’t try this at home kids) and WOW! This really works... when I used this moisturizer, my skin felt truly hydrated with a single use, and stayed healthy for two days and a half.  I’d recommend this eye cream any day and with my eyes closed (pun intended). IT REALLY WORKS! my skin is now hydrated, and looking healthier than ever (of course I started drinking water again) and I’m in love with the results using Belief USA @belifusa and, of course, I’m definitely a customer now. I use the moisturizer and eye bomb everyday before doing my makeup routine. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS GIRL!!!\n",
      "Line3837: I received this product from Influenster in a vox box and I love it! It is so hydrating under the eyes and feels so gentle. I find that it helps my undereyes less puffy. I really like the texture as I find it makes it feel much more hydrating than the cream I used before this (which was a much more watery texture)\n",
      "Line3838: In its first year of initiation, this gel eye cream was one of Sephora's best offering eye creams, giving 26 hours of hydration while smoothing the fragile skin around the eyes. Incorporate it in your skincare prepare before applying concealer—it'll have a universe of an effect in your makeup look.\n",
      "Line3839: Received this in the vox box and loved it! Typically don’t use an under eye cream just a face moisturizer. Adding this into my beauty routine is a must! My eyes feel bright when I wake up in the morning! Def recommend.\n",
      "Line3840: Literally obsessed. This cream is not oily or greasy at all. I can feel my skin soak up the moisture! I find that my make up goes on smoother and lasts longer. My skin feels amazing after using it for about a week. Definitely recommend.\n",
      "Line3841: Got this thanks to Influenster and aaahhh i had just bought a new eye cream a week before hahaha but i absolutely love it. it’s not too heavy, it’s thick tho but it blends with the skin easily and it’s not oily either. I can wear it under my makeup easily too, my eyes feel hydrated and that’s a miracle with the san diego weather.\n",

      "Line3844: There is a reason why this product is currently out of stock online at sephora-- it is truly amazing! I am a new belief-er! I was introduced to the eye bomb shortly after falling in love with their moisturizer. I normally use dr. brandt for under eye cream, and belif's moisturizing eye bomb is on par with brandt's. it is moisturizing, refreshing, and lightweight-- perfect under makeup for your morning routine. I did receive the eye bomb complimentary for sampling purposes, but will be purchasing!\n",
      "Line3845: This cream is light and feels nice, doesn’t have a smell. I haven’t really noticed a difference however, even under my makeup. For the price point there may be other better options. I probably wouldn’t purchase this again.\n",
      "Line3846: My favorite eye cream I've used up to date. My mom loves it too and says it's been very moisturizing for her and myself as well. I love the way my skin feels after using it and I feel like it's not too heavy (my eye area gets bumps when eye creams are too rich) but it's just the right amount of moisturizing\n",
      "Line3847: This eye cream has been life changing for me! I just moved to Wyoming and the elevation and wind took a toll on my otherwise happy skin. Since I started using this I’ve noticed my under eye lines seemed to have reduced and my skin is no longer irritated and dry around my eye and on my kids. I will be giving one of these to my mom as a Christmas gift! You can find it at Sephora and they even have gift sets!\n",
      "Line3848: I really love this lotion is amazing and the smell is perfect I recommend this lotion for anyone!\n",
      "Line3849: I love this product!! Belif is always really great quality and it feels amazing on your skin. I received the product free for testing from Influnster. It is pretty gentle but super effective! It isn't heavily scented either. I definitely recommend!\n",

As Im in my early 30's and really focusing on prevention, and eye cream is essential. This product absorbs quickly and make up application on top is flawless. Ive been using it every day and night now for 3+ weeks and have noticed a big improvement in hydration in my under eye area.

      "Line3853: I received this #complimentary from influenster a few days ago and so far I really like it. It feels hydrating, and normally I never can tell a difference with eye creams. I've used the moisturizer from the brand as well, and overall I love the line!\n",
      "Line3854: After seeing how dry my under eyes were getting because of the cold weather I had to go pick this up from Sephora when I saw the reviews. It is indeed extremely moisturizing. I’m not too fond of the price on this little guy so I will not be repurchasing because it was moisturizing but it didn’t WOW me. I’m not addicted to it. I’m sure I can find something a little better for the same price or even cheaper.\n",
      "Line3855: Just started looking into other eye creams to possibly switch brands from what I use now, and I’m loving this brand. You only use a small two dabs, so this will last forever. I’ve already been letting my friends try this and their moisturizer.\n",
      "Line3856: I really like this product as it keeps your skin hydrated without leaving any sticky residue. For the price I would prefer to look for a cheaper alternative, but if you are willing to spend the money I would recommend it.\n",

      "Line3858: I received this product for free for reviewing purposes.  It’s only been like 2 weeks since I’ve started using this product. Can’t really say that I definitely see a difference with my under eyes.. But what I have noticed is it is a bit more hydrated now, which is much needed for me due to winter weather. Also, the skin under my eyes are really sensitive to a lot of products and causes my skin to get raw, red, and irritated. This product though, doesn’t do that! And that’s why I don’t hate it. But I think I still need to give it a bit more time to really see if I’ll see any difference, anti-aging wise.\n",
      "Line3859: I received this product as a free sample and I love it! I've been using it for a few weeks now and it's my new go to eye cream.

      "Line3864: This is a good eye cream for day or night! It is not super heavy underneath the eyes and hydrates well! Makeup goes on over it well.\n",
      "Line3865: This eye balm was just ok. I tried a small sample size, and it didn't feel as potent as my Algenist eye cream, but it also didn't last as long. I wonder if a full size would be better.\n",
      "Line3866: This was sent to me by Influenster and it is amazing. It depuffes my eyes left them feeling rejuvenated. I love that it doesn’t have a strong smell and that is water like cream. It is expensive but it is totally worth it.\n",
      "Line3867: Adds so much hydration to the under eye area, takes crepey skin to smooth and depuffed in minutes! Love the gel like texture, doesn’t feel to heavy on the eye at all. A lot of product for the price! Definitely would buy again\n",
      "Line3868: I received this with my voxbox and I knew it was perfect for my skin during this time of year. It's an eye cream full of hydration which is perfect because, although, I have oily skin, around my eye area, it's dry. So I knew aright way I was going to love this product. I have been using it for the past two weeks or so and I love the results. My eye area isn't looking so dry anymore which reduced the fine lines quite significantly. Thank you Influenster for letting me be part of this voxbox.\n",
      "Line3869: It was moisturizing, but I really didn’t notice any difference in my fine lines. It’s probably good if you just need moisture and not wrinkle care.\n",
      "Line3870: Honestly I wasn't too sure what to expect. I've been using eye creams  for years, because everyone told me I should. A little goes a LONG way  with this product. The first time I used it, I didn't like it because I  couldn't rub it all in and thought it was greasy. Second time around, I  used a tiny dab and it absorbed into my skin nicely. After using it a  few weeks, my under eye area looks and feels really healthy and  moisturized, so I guess it's working! It has a fresh, eucalyptus scent  but it's quite strong.\n",
      "Line3871: I have been a fan of Belif for years now, so when I received the complimentary cream, I was beyond myself. As someone with sensitive skin, I loved that the scent was fresh and the texture was lightweight. I didn't like that it left my skin looking glossy as I already have oily skin, but that's based on preference! Overall, I would say it's worth the price.\n",
      "Line3872: This is my first eye cream so I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect when I received my sample from Influenster! I LOVE IT!  I never knew I needed it before but the moisturizing and firming under my eyes make my eye area look so much better! This is a great product!  My only other wish is that the product would come with some kind of pump versus the tub!\n",
      "Line3873: When i first tested his product I had mixed feelings about it because it was pretty heavy. Usually I do my makeup after i finish applying my moisturizer so applying makeup after using this product isn’t that great because the color pigment will not come on and since it’s oily the makeup just comes off. Would recommend for night time use but would have to find another product for the day time\n",
      "Line3874: Nice gel like consistency. Hydrated under eye area without disrupting makeup on top throughout the day. Bonus: the holiday set at Sephora comes with the full sized moisturizing bomb, this eye cream and a serum.. All for the price of the moisturizer. Definitely recommend!\n",
      "Line3875: I’ve been using this eye cream for the past month and I love how hydrating it makes my under eyes. It’s super light weight and has a gel-like consistency.   It is used great with the true cream bomb by Belif.\n",
      "Line3876: After using the aqua bomb I had to try the eye bomb...just as i expected ..my new fav eye cream! Not too heavy it’s smooth gel based but a different consistency than the aqua bomb it’s amazing and my under eyes are very happy with me! Def notice it reduces my eye makeup settling in my fine lines, worth every penny!\n",
      "Line3877: This eye cream glides smoothly on your skin and is absorbed quickly. I like how it's similar to a gel so it goes on my skin very easily and doesn't tug that sensitive area. I've been wearing it during the day under makeup and at night. I'm not sure about results yet, but I really enjoy it at the moment. Some eye creams sting and cause redness, but this one is very gentle. I like it!\n",
      "Line3878: This product is good for moisturizing but I have not seen a difference in under eye lines, dark circles or puffiness. I got this product to sample from Influenster. It is light weight and has a nice scent.\n",
      "Line3879: I think this eye cream is helping to eliminate some of my fine lines. I liked the Belif face moisturizer that also came in my voxbox. It's a little expensive but if you are into eye creams give it a try.\n",
      "Line3880: In love! I received this product free to try through Influenster and couldn't be happier with it. Over the last year or so I've suffered from dryness under my eyes and major dark circles. I brought this on Thanksgiving vacation with me and my skin looks AMAZING after a weeks use!\n",
      "Line3881: I received this product in my most recent Vox Box. I have seen it at Sephora but never felt particularly inclined to buy it because I have been using Clinique All About Eyes for years. I have to say I'm amazed. Reducing circles comes down to lifestyle habits (getting enough sleep, drinking lots of water and avoiding processed sugars, etc.) but also keeping your skin hydrated. I definitely feel this product hydrating my skin more than Clinique All About Eyes. It's much lighter - almost like a smooth gel - than a cream. As for results - I've already noticed a reduction in lines after two weeks. I will be repurchasing.\n",
      "Line3882: Belief products are some of my favorite face products because they don't leave your face oily, but they coat your face to feel like it is full of moisture. It is a tad bit expensive, but it's is well worth the money.\n",
      "Line3883: this eye bomb has an amazing smell is light as far as consistancy. i was very surprised in the product i wasnt expecting such a great product. The retail value is a bit pricy. its my first time using it so we will see how it goes after its gone if i notice a difference in my skin. but overall its a great product and i highly reccomend it\n",
      "Line3884: Love this eye cream, it's super gentle and completely depuffs my eye area. I have been using it for a week and noticed quite a difference in hydration and my fine lines around the eyes.\n",
      "Line3885: I absolutely love the Belif products and this eye cream is no different. It has a gel like consistency that absorbs quickly without feeling greasy. Makeup applies beautifully over the top of it. It also has a slight cooling effect. Great product overall! I received this product complimentary from Influenster, but the thoughts and review are my own.\n",
      "Line3886: I love Belif Aqua Bomb, so I knew I would love this too! The gel formula is nice, and it makes my under eyes feel cooling and smooth and hydrated!\n",
      "Line3887: Super, super hydrating. I loved using this at night and waking up feeling dewy. If applying under/before makeup, use just a tiny bit, or let it completely set before applying makeup, otherwise it might get clumpy!\n",
      "Line3888: I love this eye cream! It is very light feeling, however the moisture lasts for a long time. I live in an extremely dry climate and I have already noticed that my under eyes look brighter and firmer. My only complaint with other Belif products was that they seemed to cause my skin to become more oily, however this product seems to have found the perfect balance.\n",
      "Line3889: Belif is my new favorite brand and this eye cream (along with the moisturizing face bomb) is my new crack.  When it says it works for 24 hours it seriously doesn't lie.  I bought a small version of this in a gift kit which is amazing to travel with.  My next skincare purchase will definitely be a full size of this eye cream.\n",
      "Line3890: I recieved this for free and I love it they fill the container straight to the top. It is very moisturizing I use it at night and I little does go a long way. It's an amazing eye cream I use my ring finger and pat it under my eye it does wonders.\n",
      "Line3891: I loved this super moisturizing eye cream, at first i was using it only at night but when i read that it was perfect under makeup i decided lets try it! I fell in love! My concealer does not crease as much as before and it's still easy to blend. I feel like for the price it's really good!I did receive this for free to test out but this is my honest opinion.\n",
      "Line3892: I absolutely love this eye cream in the mornings! I pop it in my fridge every night. And when morning comes I get my coffee creamer and my eye cream. It rejuvenates my eyes for the day. Less puffiness, and hydrating to make my eyes plump. Great eye cream!!\n",
      "Line3893: This product is so hydrating and rejuvenating for the under eye area. I saw results overnight, and my skin looked noticeably healthier and less puffy under my eyes. Helped reduce inflammation as well. I would definitely repurchase this item!\n",
      "Line3894: This eye cream is amazing! It is very light and has a neutral smell. After using it 2x a day for 7 days, my eyes seem much more open and my under eye circles aren't as noticeable. I've tried so many eye creams before and have always viewed them as my least favorite skincare item but the cream is going into my daily routine! I highly recommend it!  belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb  I received this item for free from Influenster.\n",
      "Line3895: This product was an absolute dream in a bottle. I have very dry skin, and dry under eyes. Due to the dryness, my fine lines can be apparent. This has been working wonderfully. I am a makeup artist, I work in retail and I freelance as well. The fact that my concealer looked even better since using this product, I couldn’t be any happier. I definitely haven’t felt as if my eyes were dry at any point in the day. The texture is great too, not too heavy nor too light. I did receive this product for complementary for sampling purposes.\n",
      "Line3896: I received this product complimentary from Influenster to test out, and I am enjoying it so much! The packaging is much different than what I'm used to for an eye cream, but I think it adds to its uniqueness. The product itself is amazing. The cream feels thick, but upon application, it feels super light-weight and absorbs well into the skin. It's super hydrating, and my go-to eye cream!\n",
      "Line3897: I've been seriously using this on a consistent basis since the day I received it and I LOVE IT- the texture is light and the results powerful. I'm noticing that my eye area is much more hydrated the next morning when I put my makeup on.  After trying so many eye cream products this one is a winner.\n",
      "Line3898: I have very sensitive combination skin and I absolutely love this product so much. I’ve used it for a week and I have not broken out and have definitely seen the difference in my eyes! I don’t look as tired! It’s the best.\n",
      "Line3899: I am really enjoying this eye cream, I got this complimentary in my last voxbox, and I am really pleased by the hydration power and what it does to my undereye area. I have terrible dark circles, and moisturizing my undereyes is the key to improve the appearance, of this area, and this definitely does what it claims.\n",
      "Line3900: I am obsessed! I love how moisturizing this eye cream is without leaving my skin feeling oily! I have been trying to find the perfect eye cream for a reasonable price and this one takes the cake because you don’t use much at all so the price by volume is totally worth it!\n",
      "Line3901: I have been loving this product. It is so soothing and moisturizing. I have dry to normal skin so it’s been really helping especially with the colder weather. I also love the packaging  if only it had a pump!\n",
      "Line3902: This has become my #1 go to eye cream! It hydrates really well. I use it as my daytime and night time eye cream. I also use it before applying make up and it helps with smoothing my skin which makes concealer application last longer and stop any creasing. Smells amazing! A little goes a long way so this jar will definitely last you awhile.\n",
      "Line3903: I received this product as a free sample, and over the last few years I have been struggling with extremely dried out and cracking skin as winter comes. I've tried lots of different products, but I can honestly say this is the most moisture surging cream I have put on my face. I have been using the Mario Badescu moisturizer before this one, but it is no where near as moisturizing as Belif  and I will definitely be switching over after this sample. Only after 3 days of using Belif I can tell a huge difference, and It doesn't just moisturize when you apply but when you make up the next morning you can still feel the moisture bomb and my skin feels amazing! I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes, but this will be my next purchase at Sephora when my sample runs out.   belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb belif The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb\n",
      "Line3904: Shoutout to Influenster for sending me this VoxBox complimentary! I will be reviewing this product for testing purposes. Overall this is a fantastic eye cream for someone who is looking to give their eyes a moisture treatment. If you are feeling tired, dull, or dry during this winter, this product is perfect. I love the fragrance of the cream, it reminds me of a light fruity aroma. The cream itself leaves the eye area feeling smoothed out and ridden from any fine lines.\n",
      "Line3905: I received this eye bomb complimentary for testing purposes and I’m so glad I did because I absolutely love it. It’s lightweight, a little goes a long way and it’s perfect under make up. There is so much product in the jar I imagine it will last a very long time\n",
      "Line3906: I received this eye cream free in the recent VoxBox and holy cow it is amazing. I have yours is morning and night for three days but I could tell a difference instantly. It made my bags go down, my eyes seem brighter and my makeup went on smoother. It is just the right cooling effect to work but not feel uncomfortable or make your eyes water. It is light but so moisturizing that I can feel it the next morning after sleeping all night. A little goes a long way so you get a ton of bang for your buck. I will definitely be purchasing this when I run out!\n",
      "Line3907: Looooved this eye cream. Seriously the first one I've ever used that I can still feel working the next day.\n",
      "Line3908: I've been using this moisturizer for a few days now and I love it. It has a thick almost gel like consistency and feels very luxurious and a little goes a long way. I've actually got this on my lashes a couple times by accident and it didn't irritate my eyes at all so I think it would work well for those with sensitive eyes. Also, I love how well makeup applies over this. My skin just drinks this up, so I wait a couple minutes after applying the cream and then apply my makeup as usual. The cream give the makeup a nice base to glide over and doesn't pill at all. If you have dry or dehydrated skin around the eyes definitely give this a try or pick up a sample of it from sephora.\n",
      "Line3909: Most of the puffy tiredness look is gone! 5 days using and im absolutely loving the results. Definitely recommend!\n",
      "Line3910: I am absolutely amazed at how WELL this works! It smells amazing and keeps all my dry area well hydrated. My skin feels soft and smooth. I like the way it looks too. It feels like there may be some mint in it, i love it!\n",
      "Line3911: I received this eye cream to try and it's knocked every other eye cream i've been using off my vanity for the time being.This product really does moisturize more than any other one i've been using. You can tell when you put it on that your skin just soaks it up and is much softer and brighter after using. With winter coming, this is the just the cream my skin needs. I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes.\n",
      "Line3912: This cream is really good! I don't use often a cream for eyes area and during this winter I know that our skin needs more attention. So I started to use it and my skin feels so soft right now! The packing is too beautiful and the design is really good. I definitely would recommend it to my friends\n",
      "Line3913: This stuff is what dreams are made of. Light and creamy to the touch. Makes you feel refreshed and hydrated. In love with this product! Disclaimer: I received this product for free from Influenster for reviewing purposes\n",
      "Line3914: I love this eye cream! Very moisturizing! Lasts a long time. Large jar. Good value! Can be purchased at Sephora. I use nightly\n",
      "Line3915: Amazing gel eye cream. I love this brand! Light weight formula with amazing smell. Feels like a gel. Looks, smells and feels just like the true cream aqua bomb gel moisturizer but has different products in the formula to smooth eyes, soothing them, depuffing and brightening. This cream is perfect for at night on the eye. Very moisturizing and doesn’t bother my oily eyelids from the formula. Packaging is cute and sleek. Amazing product and easy to apply and use. Would recommend this product to anyone in the market for an amazing eye cream. Will repurchase from Sephora. That’s where I got the first one, bout to pick up my second container soon. Loving this formula!\n",
      "Line3916: This eye cream is right on par with another eye cream I've been using for about 2 years. The old one is twice as much money for 3/4ths of the product. Only thing I prefer about it is that it comes in an airtight pump. This one comes in a pot which concerns me when it comes to sanitation and quality of ingredients. I am very glad this one didn't give me any milia issues and it didn't sting at all. Sometimes my lashes get in the way and it can burn, but not this eye cream! I really appreciate getting to try this out and can't wait to see what happens after using it for a month or so! So far it's just been very moisturizing, not sure it's supposed to help dark circles but it may! We will see. I am very hopeful that this will be my new eye cream! Came right when I ran out of the old one :)\n",
      "Line3917: I didn't expect that I'd love this product so much! It's smells good, has smooth texture, moisturizing my eyes well and I fell so fresh after using it! It's perfect eye cream before your makeup routine.\n",
      "Line3918: I received this in the Belif Vox Box and I’m in love, I have puffy dry under eyes and this allows me to wake up with smooth under eyes that concealer doesn’t fall off of during the day!\n",
      "Line3919: Totally in love with this product! I received this as a sample to review and I’m SO impressed! My eye area looks brighter, softer and healthier after just a couple of uses! And a little goes a long way, so I’m happy I’ll be able to use this for a long time!\n",
      "Line3920: It’s not too thick and not too thin, perfect consistency. Has a light lemon ish scent but not strong at all. My face is feeling plump and moisturized after using this, and it is defined needed for these winter months.\n",
      "Line3921: What a nice eye treat!  My friend has gotten this cream at Sephora and swears by it!! This eye cream has a jelly cooling texture. . A little of it  goes a long way. It feels very moisturizing and satisfying especially now that it’s getting colder , also super light and absorbs deep into my skin! 5 star. belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb\n",
      "Line3922: Absolutely hands down the best eye cream I have ever used! I’m an exhausted mom to 3 little boys and this feel so luxurious on my eyes! I will never buy another eye cream again!\n",
      "Line3923: This is the best moisturizer for dry skin. I was a little hesitant to try it because it’s a cream..but it is amazing! Since purchasing my first one I had to buy another for a backup!  Definitely would buy again!   #belif\n",
      "Line3924: It is the most hydrating eye cream ever. It transformed my under eye in about two weeks. Fine lines less visible. Just love it!!!\n",
      "Line3925: This eye cream helps with moisturizing the eye area and helps keep skin elasticity around the eye area. This eye cream is not specifacly for eye wrinkles, belif makes another eye cream for that but I did notice it did help with some eye creases around my eyes. I got this at Sephora for $48 but it lasts a long time. Ive had it for 6 months and it's still has a lot of product in it. It's a thick white cream and I dot it around my eye area with my pinky, never rub. It's instantly moisturzes on contact and basically keeps moisturizing till I wash my face the next day. It does not irritate my eyes at all and I notice the area around my eyes are softer and look more plump.\n",
      "Line3926: LITERAL HOLY GRAIL! i heard good things about this product and received minis at GenBeauty! I use this everyday and is gentle on my skin. i did notice a change in the area underneath my eyes an the results were great!\n",
      "Line3927: It hydrates under my eyes perfectly and helps make my baggy eyes in the morning less noticeable. It makes me feel very comfortable in my skin!\n",
      "Line3928: Excellent eye cream, it does what it describes. Extreme hydration that last more than 24 hrs, work prefectly under make up but make sure to late it dry at least 10 minutes! I recommend this product to people in their 20s\n",
      "Line3929: One word .....AMAZING !!!!! I love this eye cream it feels so good on the skin and it makes you look awake and it’s very hydrating\n",
      "Line3930: I have tried several eye products from high end to drug store ones...This one certainly helps to moisturize the eye area making the under eye area really hydrated.\n",
      "Line3931: I received this in a free sample. After washing my face one night tried it out before bed! Oh man! I literally went to the store the next day to get the full size. I love this product. It makes my under eyes feel hydrated, it is SO smooth. The only thing I don’t like is that I feel the packaging is deceiving. The container is so much bigger but not a lot of product. However, you don’t use much. I definitely recommend this, I wish I had this product in my life sooner.\n",
      "Line3932: I really loved this line as a facial moisturizer so when I found out they had an eye cream, I had to go for it! It has the same gel, cooling feel as the face moisturizer. I noticed that the skin around my eyes was a lot smoother and softer. Very nice feel!\n",
      "Line3933: I got a couple of samples of this in Sephora orders and I absolutely love it. It's so hydrating. I have very sensitive skin and I haven't had any reaction to this, unlike a lot of other eye creams I've tried. I will definitely be purchasing the full size when my trial sizes run out.\n",
      "Line3934: Holy vats of amazing eye cream, Batman!  This stuff is destined to become a cult favorite.  I was extremely dehydrated and my eyes were showing it in a huge way...dry and showing every single line.  My eyes were aging me by 5 years that day...but luckily that was the same day this little blue pot of glory arrived from Sephora.  One tiny dab with my ring finger under each eye and my skin instantly plumped and softened AND it stayed that way for 24 hours.  No joke.  I awoke the next day with eyes softer than a silk.  Color me a carp (bad fish analogy...sorry) because Belif Eye Bomb caught me - hook, line and sinker.  I will totally buy this for the coming dry winter months.\n",
      "Line3935: Just like all the other Belif products I love this! Very light but very moisturizing! It smells just like the aqua bomb moisturizer which I definitely don't mind. The tiniest bit goes a very long way so this jar will last a long time.    I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Line3936: Ultra moisturizing, this cream satiates skin with lush hydration for lasting smoothness and firming. I love that it doesn't have an  overwhelming fragrance and didn't irritate my sensitive skin. While the moisture is very intense, it was rich without being greasy, and didn't cause my makeup to smudge or wear differently over it.\n",
      "Line3937: This is another sample I obtained from Sephora.  I'm happy to report with this second Belif sample I'm an official \"Belif-er\"!  This helps retain moisture and makes my undereye look really nice (when it's usually dark and saggy.)  Creamy texture without leaving skin dewy, and slightly brightening!\n",
      "Line3938: I found my new eye cream! Helps to reduce any dark circles and very smooth while applying under eyes and keeps hydrated and helps with fine lines.\n",
      "Line3939: This eye gel is an amazing lightweight gel with a super smooth application and a hydration punch that makes me look like I've had 10 hours of sleep when I'm only running on 4. If you like BELIF's True Aqua Bomb, then this eye cream is right up your alley.\n",
      "Line3940: Esta crema de ojos es perfecta para personas de piel normal a grasa. Tengo undereye seco e hidrata pero no como yo quisiera\n",
      "Line3941: My go to eye cream! I have to be careful with products since I am prone to getting milia under my eyes. This is the perfect texture, feels so good on the skin and isn't heavy! They call it moisturizing bomb for a reason! I would highly recommend this product!!\n",
      "Line3942: Which skin type is it good for?

      "Line3943: This moisturizer dis wonders for my under eyes. I don't get nearly enough sleep, so I find my eyes look \"worn\" lately. This improves the appearance instantly. The lines under my eyes look less noticeable and darkness /puffiness subsides. I had a sample last me 2 months using it every day! I bought the full size and after about 3 months my hereditary curse has greatly reduced\n",
      "Line3944: I love this cream it is a very good moisturizer it's not to pricey it lasts a while to\n",

       "[\"well, eye cream. i felt like it was a waste of money to be very honest. having never used an eye cream before, except for my eye stick, i felt like i wasn't going to use it, but wasn't i wrong?!i brought this one to my dorm actually, so that i could use it there. its a cute sample size. but it makes my eyes feel so hydrated!!!this eye cream has a rather strong herbal scent, which might not appeal to everyone. if you've already tried the aqua bomb, you're most likely already familiar with the scent. it's almost the same. i personally stop smelling it once it has absorbed into the skin. i don't mind the scent too much, but i get that others might not like it.the texture is very creamy and lightweight, and it sinks in really quickly. it does leave somem sort of balmy texture behind though, but you only notice it when you touche it with your finger. it makes my skin smooth and hydrated. i am a big fan!\\n\",\n",
       " 'this product is amazing i have the worst under eye circles and this cream has helped moisturize my eye continuously. i love the belief products and i highly recommend using them!\\n',\n",
       " 'me encantó. recibí este producto en formato tester por mis compras en ulta y luego de leer reseñas, le di una oportunidad. omg, increíble. mi contorno de ojos era súper seco y con finas líneas, ahora se siente hidratado, suave y el maquillaje luce mucho mejor. lo recomiendo!!\\n',\n",
       " 'i recently ran out of the lancôme genifique eye cream that i’d been using for the last 3ish months (which i loved), so i decided to try this sample i got from ulta. this belif eye cream is amazing!!! it’s thick, creamy and super hydrating. a little bit goes a long way, i was able to use this sample packet for 4 days, including the first day where i used enough to moisturize my entire face! 😂🤦🏼\\u200d♀️ it doesn’t have a scent really at all and it’s very gentle, so i think it would be fine for all skin types.  this eye cream retails at $48 for 0.84oz so it’s super affordable (compared to the lancôme eye cream, which this is 100% a dupe for). i would absolutely purchase and recommend this to anyone!\\n',\n",
       " 'yesss this is a great eye cream. it is hydrating and the texture is a gel cream. feels super nice on the eye area. i like to use this as a cooling eye cream, so i store this in the fridge. works wonders :)\\n',\n",
       " 'another sample i got and purchased the full size after. this is my go to eye cream and the full size jar will last you forever! good price for a great product. it helps with bags and under eye discoloration as well as those fine lines you get with mature skin. definitely recommend\\n',\n",
       " \"it's actually pretty nice as far as eye creams go. i find most to be useless but this one really was moisturizing. i dont think id buy the full size though because although it caused me no irritation, the smell i find to be really off putting. its  got a citrus scent but in a cleaning product kind of way.\\n\",\n",
       " \"i received this product for free from influenster and belif in exchange of my honest review. i've been using belif moisturizing eye bomb for more than a week and i already notice a difference on my eyes especially my undereye. it's lightweight and it moisturize my underye. i noticed that it lightens the darkness e too. i like using it in the morning before putting concealer.\\n\",\n",
       " 'i received this in my first allure beauty box. i love how unbelievably moisturizing this formula is! it includes ceramides, oat extract, willow bark extract, and squalane (amongst others) which all combine to create a literal moisturizing bomb for my under eyes. my issue with this, and why i have deducted two stars, is that this product has citrus autrantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, citral, citronellol, limonene, and several more ingredients that can be irritating to some people. all of these ingredients are completely unnecessary, and i hope that in the future they make a version that is free of irritating fragrance and oils for those of you out there who can’t use (or just don’t enjoy) fragranced products! i also am a firm believer that an eye cream is just a repackaged and overpriced moisturizer, occasionally with some mica thrown in it to reflect light and make the under eyes look brighter. find a great moisturizer, and use that under your eyes and it will be just as beneficial.\\n',\n",
       " 'belif really does know how to do hydration! this moisturizer is super gentle and you’ll see an instant glow!\\n',\n",
       " 'this eye cream it’s really a bomb, you can feel freshness in your eyes immediately after you put this eye cream\\n',\n",
       " 'i really didn’t think it was possible for me to like any belif brand products until now. all of their gel moisturizers leave a sticky film on my skin and don’t seem to absorb. the moisturizing eye balm is different though. it absorbs well into my skin and the gel hydrates my eye area big time, but without leaving a weird film on my skin. this isn’t my absolute favorite eye cream of all time, but it’s still a good product.\\n',\n",
       " 'this korean skincare brand is a popular little gem and for good reason. it has soothing tiger grass & oat kernel extract as well as inflammation-fighting comfrey leaf to comfort your tierd and puffy eyes along with darkened spots. the cooling formula is also packed with glycerin and squalane which instantly softens stressed skin. worked awesome for my poor stressed eyes!\\n',\n",
       " 'this moisturizing eye bomb is the bomb!! i love that a bit goes a long way. you don’t need to use a lot of the product! it smells very citrusy and it’s light and gentle to your skin. very hydrating! belif\\n',\n",
       " 'i’ve tried many different eye creams and this one is my favourite! i love how hydrating if feels and how much more bright it looks under my eyes!! definitely recommend!!\\n',\n",
       " 'excellent product. very kind to skin and shows improvement of under eye impurities. so far i’m very satisfied with this product. i use this in conjunction with the belif moisturizer.\\n',\n",
       " 'a lightweight but powerful moisturizing eye cream. fights premature aging, diminishes existing fine lines, and is cooling. i deducted a star because i feel as though this product is over priced ($48 at sephora).\\n',\n",
       " 'this eye cream was nice although it does have more of a thicker texture so i’m not sure people with oily skin would like that but it was great for my dry skin so i did enjoy using it but i feel like i could get the same feel and result from something a bit more affordable. i’d recommend it if you’d want to try it but personally i wouldn’t purchase the full size of this.\\n',\n",
       " 'this is one of my favorite brand and i really like this moisturizing eye bomb. this is perfect for my eyes. it feels like water has kissed my under eyes. this is really perfect 💙💙 i would recommend.💦💦💦\\n',\n",
       " 'the eye cream is amazing. currently, it’s a top favorite of mine because it really does seem to brighten and de-puff my under eyes. i also enjoyed how the balm left a really nice cooling sensation. i’m able to use it 360 degrees around my eye and not have any sensitivity either. it definitely is tightening and brightening. thanks influenster for sending this to me to try.\\n',\n",
       " \"i received a sample of this with a sephora purchase and fell in love. it's hydrating and gentle enough for my sensitive eyes. there wasn't enough product in the sample for me to use it long enough to tell if it made a difference with my dark circles, but i will definitely purchase a full size jar when i get the chance!\\n\",\n",
       " 'i received this voxbox from influenster to sample a couple of burst of hydration creams with glowing skin effects. the belif aqua bomb brightener smells citrusy and the eye bomb both blend well into the skin. the textures are creamy and can be used at any time of the day. i am into products that have a clean smell and that contain vitamins in the products. i recommend these products after showering to avoid an over greasy feeling on the skin. the eye bomb does not have any smell and took a couple of days before i noticed an ease of my laugh lines. \\n',\n",
       " 'i love the coolness and ease which this cream applies. it really does what it claims to do. the scent is really pleasant and i would absolutely purchase and truly recommend\\n',\n",
       " 'loved this product! i received a complimentary sample size, this eye bomb is so moisturizing! it’s gentle and soothing. it has a cool and cold tingly feeling, which is so nice in the morning it helps wake me up! i love this product and it has became a staple in my skincare routine!\\n',\n",
       " 'i love this eye cream. it is probably one of the best that i have ever tried! i got a small sample size complementary from influenster however i am so impressed with how little product do you need for each application. you just need the tiniest amount on your finger and it covers your under eyes as well as extra to put on your eyelid. this is really nice because it is an expensive product however i do think if you were to buy it it would last you a really long time. i also really enjoy how this product makes my under eyes feel. it does have that water-based feel which is really nice and it has not clogged my pores which is very important to me however it’s also so incredibly hydrating.\\n',\n",
       " 'i liked instant moisture and hydration this cream provided, and kept my eye area hydrated all day. imo, this eye cream is good for a quick moisturizing fix.  the cream is lightweight, smooth, which makes the application effortless, it has a very mild not artificial scent, i like that there are herbs in the ingredients (comfrey leaf, tiger grass). also it is free of mineral oils/petrolatum ,but i see it still has alcohol, which is \"a no\" for me. besides, last time i checked belief was not cruelty-free,...still?\\n',\n",
       " 'this stuff makes my eyes feel so refreshed ! i love using it after i clean my face and moisturize. i even like using it when i feel sleepy in the day. come on cold and smooth almost like an aloe feeling .\\n',\n",
       " 'i received this in my allure beauty box~ i am already a fan of the belief products. this did not disappoint! it goes on beautifully and makes the under eye feel great. i will be purchasing a regular size. belif moisturizing eye bomb\\n',\n",
       " 'it hydrates very well, easy to spread under your eye. i’m not sure if it helps with elasticity. the other one is good too.\\n',\n",
       " 'love this stuff! got this as a sample thanks to sephora. loved the consistency so much, i started using it as my nightly facial moisturizer. now i don’t really notice much in the way of improvement around my eyes (lines or wrinkles, but i don’t have many to start with)... but i find the value in its moisturizing abilities. it leaves my skin incredibly supple, i wake up and still feel that my skin is hydrated. i’m going to try their regular face bomb cream before i buy, cuz $48 for full size bottle (.84oz) is a little spendy and i want to see which one is better since this one isn’t really marketed as a full face cream 🙃\\n',\n",
       " \"the best eye cream i've ever used. \\xa0i use it every night. it keeps my eyes moisturized. i wake up feeling more refreshed and my under eyes are less dry and tired. i have sensitive eyes and it doesn’t cause irritation. so happy with this product. definitely worth it! highly recommend it!  belif moisturizing eye bomb\\n\",\n",

       " 'i loved the products. this cream leaves your skin super beautiful, very well hydrated and gives a rich smell, when passing over your face you feel that it relieves you and gives an immediate warning #belifhydrationheroes #contest #complimentary @belifusa @belifcanada @influensterbelif moisturizing eye bomb\\n',\n",
       " \"i recieved this sample in one of my monthly subscription boxes. i've tried several different eye creams and this one fell short for me. if you just need a moisturizer for your under eye area, this us great. however, i have dark circles and puffiness so i prefer products that have ingredients that correct these issues. not terrible, just not for me.\\n\",\n",
       " 'i love these eye cream my eye lids are very dry but these cream makes my eyes feel and look very moisturized during the day. i’m definitely getting the normal size.\\n',\n",
       " 'if you’re looking for an eye cream, you’re either 1. adding it to your routine, or 2. starting to notice serious lack of hydration during makeup sessions. in allll honesty i thought my eyes were maybe aging pretty bad, but few weeks in and the lines have minimally reduced, my concealer is starting to look at its best again. moisture is essential to the skin, this is definitely a bomb of hydration. it exceeded my expectation because i thought maybe it was a hyped product, specially with its reasonable price. i was even more impressed at the amount of product in the mini sample, all you need is a dab!\\n',\n",
       " \"eye creams aren't necessary for my routine, but i do enjoy a nice one when they come my way. this is my first time i used a belif product and i really enjoyed this. the cream is lightweight and glides on skin. there is fragrance in this product and i was a little anxious, but my eyes experienced no redness or irritation from this. for those that are curious about scent, this has a light citrus smell.   i would caution sensitive skin types and those that may have irritated skin to avoid this or wait until your skin repairs itself. i didn't realize i had a small cut on my hand and this cream made my skin red and sensitized only on that spot which is how i found out.  after using this for a few days, i really have come to enjoy this, but it is too pricey for me. if you need an eye cream, i would look elsewhere since the price makes this not worth it. however, if you get it as a gift or free sample i would recommend trying it out since it sinks so nicely in the skin.\\n\",\n",
       " 'this eye cream tightened the skin around my eyes right away after the first time use. it is light and does not have strong odor. it is also made in korea which definitely adds some points😃\\n',\n",
       " \"this is a nice daytime eye cream. it moisturizes well and has a light, fresh fragrance (eucalyptus, maybe?). it reduces puffiness and tingles a little when i put it on, which is actually kind of nice in the morning! i haven't seen much difference in terms of fine lines and wrinkles, but it's solidly in the rotation! ✨👍  belif moisturizing eye bomb\\n\",\n",
       " 'my absolute favorite eye cream of all time and i have tried so many!  i love that a little goes a long way and that no matter what the amount is that i apply, every application feels luxurious.  no scent and clean!  wake up to youthful and supple hydrated eyes.  at 37, this cream is my fountain of youth.  worth the price!\\n',\n",
       " 'this eye cream is great for both day and night! it’s great for day because it works well under makeup, but it’s also hydrating enough for night time. i usually use separate eye creams for day and night, but this one is great for travel because i only need to bring this one! i also have really dry undereyes and eyelids that are eczema prone, so a really moisturizing eye cream is a must for me. the only con for me is that it smells too much like fresh ginger (and i don’t really like ginger lol).\\n',\n",

       " 'this is a great moisturizer for underneath the eye area. i will say that this is not an anti aging eye cream but highly hydrating for someone like me who suffers from dry skin underneath the eyes. i apply this with my facial moisturizer and let it settle into my skin before applying makeup so this eye gel really helps make my concealer look a little more fresh. i would totally repurchase and use this as my day eye cream for extra hydration.\\n',\n",
       " 'i love how it hydrates the contour of my eyes, its content is very good since it has hyaluronic acid and vitamins c and e, it does not irritate at all and does not burn, they even lowered the tone of the dark circles a bit\\n',\n",
       " \"awakens & refreshes the skin! this truly is like a drink of water for your face. i have dry skin especially during the summer so i appreciate the hydration this product provides and a little bit goes a long way. it sort of reminds me of tarte drink of h2o hydrating boost moisturizer. to be honest i will definitely be retiring that and using this instead.   this product gives a healthy, youthful glow and i trying believe it helps improve the appearance of lines & wrinkles. its lightweight & non-greasy plus it helps soften & plump skin's appearance. it ensures smooth makeup application, no pilling. #hydrationhero #contest #complimentary @belifusa @belifcanada @influenster\\n\",\n",

       " 'the belif moisturizing eye bomb is perfect for those who suffer of a dry eye area and those who want to improve the look and get rid of fine lines. after using this eye cream for about three weeks i feel like im qualified to speak about this product. the belif moisturizing eye bomb applies beautifully under the eye and absorbs nicely into the skin leaving a great finish, free of residue and ready for makeup application. it is recommended to massage the product around the eye area as usual with the ring fingers and is suggested to pat the product along the contours of the eye which is great! to me the contours of the eye is the orbital bone and not many eye creams are meant to be used in the upper eye area. i have especially been enjoying that because i feel like my eyelids had been looking a bit wrinkly. i found that after using this eye cream the elasticity in my lids has significantly improved. the feeling of the cream on the skin is smooth and cooling giving the eyes the perk that is much needed in the mornings. i am pleased to say that the eye cream does great all day long, it truly keeps the eye looking smooth and hydrated for the day. a problem i have ran into with other eye creams is that they seem to not absorb properly into the skin and cause my concealers to move and crease. this belif moisturizing eye bomb  does not do that at all, it sits perfectly and works great under my makeup. although this product delivers moisture to eye immediately to the skin i suggest using it daily for long lasting and continuous results. i rate the belif eye cream a 5 stars out of 5.  i feel that all belif’s claims are true and would recommend this product to you.  i hope that if you were debating on this product my review helped you make your choice. i do want to again disclose that i received this product complementary for testing purposes from belif and influenster. for more exquisite glow content follow my instaram account @exquisiteglow belif moisturizing eye bomb\\n',\n",
